LOCAL STABILITY ANALYSIS ON LOTKA-VOLTERRA PREDATOR-PREY MODELS WITH PREY REFUGE AND HARVESTING Christopher Chow Master of Science, 2018 Applied Mathematics Ryerson University

ABSTRACT
We propose a predator-prey model by incorporating a constant harvesting rate into a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model with prey refuge which was studied recently. All the positive equilibria and the local stability of the proposed model are studied and analyzed by sorting out the intervals of the parameters involved in the model. These intervals of the parameters exhibit the effects on the dynamical behaviors of prey and predators. The emphasis is put on the ranges of the prey refuge constant and harvesting rate. We show that the model has two positive boundary equilibria and one equilibrium. By using the qualitative theory for planar systems, we show that the two positive boundary equilibria can be saddles, saddle-nodes, topological saddles or stable or unstable nodes, and the interior positive equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. Under suitable restrictions on the parameters, we prove that the positive interior equilibrium is a stable node.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Definitions and Notation

Consider the following autonomous dynamical system    x  (t) := f (x(t), y (t)),   y  (t) := g (x(t), y (t)). For t  0, with initial values (x(0), y (0)) = (x0 , y0 )

(1.1.1)

We use the standard notation for a derivative with respect to time, where dx(t) x  (t) = dt

Definition 1.1.1. (x(t), y (t)) is said to be a solution of (1.1.1) if x, y  C 1 and satisfies both equations of (1.1.1). A solution (x(t), y (t)) is said to be positive if for all t  0, x(t), y (t)  0; a boundary if x(t)  0 or y (t)  0; positive interior if x(t), y (t) > 0 . 1

Definition 1.1.2. (x , y  )  R2 is said to be an equilibrium of (1.1.1) if it satisfies f (x , y  ) = 0 and g (x , y  ) = 0. An equilibrium point (x , y  ) is said to be positive if x , y   0; a boundary if x = 0 or y  = 0; positive interior if x , y  > 0. Definition 1.1.3. A map T : R2  R2 defined by T (x, y ) = (h1 (x, y ), h2 (x, y )) is said to be regular if T is one to one and onto, T and T -1 are continuous and |A(x, y )| = 0 on R2 . Definition 1.1.4. If T is regular, then the following transformation    x1 = h1 (x, y ),   y1 = h2 (x, y ) is said to be a regular transformation. If (1.2.1) is changed into another system under suitable regular transformations, then the two systems are said to be equivalent.

Local Stability Analysis

In order to analyze the local asymptotic stability near an equilibrium of a system of first order autonomous non-linear scalar differential equations, we can use the method of linearization [2], which is described below. Consider the autonomous dynamical system of non-linear equations with two variables, x and y:     x  (t) = f (x, y ), (1.2.1)

  y  (t) = g (x, y ), 2

Assume the system (1.2.1) has an equilibrium (x , y  ).

We may expand the functions f and g using the Taylor series centered at (x , y  ) where u = x - x and v = y - y  : du u2 = f (x , y  ) + fx (x , y  )u + fy (x , y  )v + fxx (x , y  ) + fxy (x , y  )uv + ... dt 2 2 u dv = g (x , y  ) + gx (x , y  )u + gy (x , y  )v + gxx (x , y  ) + gxy (x , y  )uv + ... dt 2 Definition 1.2.1. The following system is said to be linearized about the equilibrium (x , y  ): dX = AX dt where X = (uv )T and A is the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the equilibrium (x , y  ). We denote by A(x, y ) the Jacobian matrix of f and g at (x, y ), that is, f  A(x, y ) =  x g x   f y  g  y

(1.2.2)

and by |A(x, y )| and tr(A(x, y )) its determinant and trace, respectively.

3

The eigenvalues of A(x, y ) are determined by the roots of the characteristic polynomial: P () = 2 - tr (x, y ) + |A(x, y )| The solutions of a linear system can be studied near the equilibrium (x , y  ) by the eigenvalues, 1 , 2 , of A(x , y  )

Definition 1.2.2. An equilibrium of system (1.2.1) is said to be: (a) a saddle when the eigenvalues of (1.2.2) are real numbers such that 1 < 0 < 2 . (b) a node when the eigenvalues are real numbers with the same sign. A node is called a stable when 1,2 < 0. It is called an unstable node when it is not stable; in this case 1,2 > 0 . (c) locally asymptotically stable when eigenvalues are negative or have negative real part. The following results apply to non-linear planar systems of first order differential equations. The results require that the system may be linearized about an equilibrium, in this case the non-linear system behaves similiarly to a linear system, with some exceptions. The results have been commonly used to study the local stability of biological models based on non-linear systems, for example, in [11, 23, 22, 13, 21, 20, 16, 36]. We later will use these qualitative theories when discussing local stabilities. Lemma 1.2.1. [27] Let (u , v  ) be an equilibrium of (1.2.1). Then the following assertions hold. 4

(i) If |A(u , v  )| < 0, then (u , v  ) is a saddle. (ii) If |A(u , v  )| > 0 and (tr(A(u , v  )))2 - 4|A(u , v  )|  0, then (u , v  ) is a node. It is stable if tr(A(u , v  )) < 0 and unstable if tr(A(u , v  )) > 0. (iii) Assume that |A(u , v  )| > 0. If tr(A(u , v  )) < 0, then (u , v  ) is locally asymptotically stable; if tr(A(u , v  )) = 0, then it is stable and if tr(A(u , v  )) > 0, then it is unstable. Lemma 1.2.2. [20] Let (u , v  ) be an equilibrium of (1.2.1). Assume that |A(u , v  )| = 0, tr(A(u , v  )) = 0 and (1.2.1) is equivalent to the following system    u  1 = p(u1 , v1 ),   v  1 = v1 + q (u1 , v1 ) with an isolated equilibrium (0, 0), where p(u1 , v1 ) = q (u1 , v1 ) =
 i j i+j =2,i,j 0 bij u1 v1  i+j =2,i,j 0 j aij ui 1 v1 and

(1.2.3)

are convergent power series. If

= 0 and

a20 = 0, then (u , v  ) is a saddle-node. A function f :   R2  R is said to be analytic in an open set  if it has a convergent Taylor series in some neighborhood of each point in  (see [27, p.69]). When |A(u , v  )| = tr(A(u , v  )) = 0 and A(u , v  ) = 0, under suitable regular transformations, (1.2.1) is equivalent to the following form    u  = v,   v  = ak uk [1 + h(u)] + bn un v [1 + g (u)] + v 2 R(u, v )

(1.2.4)

with equilibrium (0, 0), where h, g and R are analytic in a neighborhood of (0, 0), h(0) = g (0) = 0, k  2, ak = 0 and n  N. Lemma 1.2.3 ([1, 27]). Let (u , v  ) be an equilibrium of (1.2.1) and |A(u , v  )| = tr(A(u , v  )) = 0 and A(u , v  ) = 0. If (1.2.1) is equivalent to (1.2.4), k = 2m + 1  N and ak > 0, then (u , v  ) is a topological saddle.

Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Models

Systems of two suitable first order ordinary differential equations can be used to model the interaction between predators and their prey. The dynamical behaviors of the predators and prey can be described by studying the local stability of the planar systems. These dynamical properties provide insight into whether the prey and predators will coexist or suffer from mutual extinction. One of the classical predator-prey models is the Lotka-Volterra predatorprey model, which is often used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact. Since 1925, a variety of predator-prey models have been proposed by introducing functional responses such as HollingTanner predator responses [4, 15, 14, 21, 22, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34], Beddington-DeAngelis functional responses [3, 5, 10, 20], ratio-dependent functional responses [17, 19, 35], and harvesting rates [13, 18, 20, 22, 35, 36]. The dynamical behaviors of these models have been widely investigated and analyzed.

1.4

The Proposed Model

In 2010, Ma [24] proposed and studied a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model with a constant prey refuge, which is governed by the following system    x x  = rx(1 - K ) - c(x - R)y, (1.4.1)   y  = e(x - R)y - dy, where x(t) and y (t) denote the density of prey and predator populations at time t, respectively, r is the growth rate of the prey, K is the carrying capacity of the prey, c is the per capita rate of predation of the predator (fraction of the prey population eaten per predator), e is a conversion rate of eaten prey into new predator abundance, d is the per capita death rate of the predator and R is the constant prey refuge. The model was further studied and analyzed in [6, 7]. It was showed in [6, 24] that the positive interior equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and it was proved in [7] that the positive boundary equilibria are saddles for arbitrary prey refuge. Other predator-prey models with constant prey refuges can be found for example, in [8, 12, 18, 25, 29]. Harvesting strategies play important roles in the study of optimal management and exploitation renewable resources [9]. A variety of constant or nonconstant harvesting rates have been incorporated into predator-prey models, for example in [13, 18, 20, 22, 35, 36] In this paper, we incorporate a constant prey harvesting rate, denoted by h, into the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model with prey refuge (1.4.1). This means that prey are being removed from the environment due to some 7

external factor, most likely due to humans hunting or poaching the prey population. The proposed model is governed by the following planar system    x x  = rx(1 - K ) - c(x - R)y - h, (1.4.2)   y  = e(x - R)y - dy. Following [7], we consider solutions (x, y ) of (1.4.2) satisfying x(t)  0 and y (t)  0 for t  0, but unlike the study in [6, 7, 24], where the authors directly study (1.4.1) without simplification, we use a suitable transformation to change (1.4.2) into an equivalent system and reduce the 7 parameters in (1.4.2) to 4 parameters in the following new system    u  = u(1 - u) - (u - )v -  := f (u, v ),   v  =  (u - )v - v := g (u, v ). This model we will be refered to frequently in the following chapters. It will be the main focus of the work done, however all results found for system (1.4.3) will also pertain to the equivalent system (1.4.2) on which the model is based.

Chapter 2 Qualitative Behaviour of The Equilibrium Points
2.1 Equivalent System

In this section we provide a method for constructing system (1.4.3), which is equivalent to system (1.4.2). The number of parameters are reduced from 7 to 4, while at the same time preserving the biological meanings of each parameter. For this reason, we choose to discuss system(1.4.3) instead of system (1.4.2). The method of using suitable transformations to reduce the number of parameters in biological models has been widely used in [11, 13, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 36]. We will use system (1.4.3) to study the model using the qualitative theory discussed in the previous chapter, but first we would like to detail the construction of system (1.4.3).

Theorem 2.1.1. system (1.4.2):    x x  = rx(1 - K ) - c(x - R)y - h,   y  = e(x - R)y - dy, is equivalent to system (1.4.3):    u  = u(1 - u) - (u - )v -    v  =  (u - )v - v ¯ = rt, u = x/K and v = cy/r, where  = R/K ,  = eK/r,  = d/r and by t  = h/(Kr) ¯ = rt, u = x/K and v = cy/r, Proof. Let t du du = · ¯ dt dt 1 = Kr 1 = Kr du dx dt 1 dx 1 · = · ¯ dx dt dt K dt r x rx(1 - ) - c(x - R)y - h K Ku rv rKu 1 - - c(Ku - R) - h K c R h = u(1 - u) - u - v- K Kr dt = ¯ dt = u(1 - u) - (u - )v -

Let T : R2  R2 be the mapping such that T is defined by the correspondence T (x) = Ax, where x  R2 ,  A= 1/K 0 and T -1 (x) = A-1 xT  A-1 =  0 c/r   and |A| = c = 0, rK

  and |A| = rK =0 c

For any p, q  R2 , where p = (p1 p2 )T and q = (q1 q2 )T and any scalar s  R we have that T (p + q ) = T (p) + T (q ) since A · (p + q ) = Ap + Aq =
p1 +q1 K c(p2 +q2 ) r T

We will show that T is continuous. Let > 0 be given, choose  = /||A||. Let x  R2 and a  R2 such that ||x - a|| <  then ||T (x) - T (a)|| = ||T (x - a)|| = ||A · (x - a)||  ||A|| · ||(x - a)|| < ||A|| = 11

Hence, ||T (x) - T (a)|| <

when ||x - a|| <  . Thus T is continuous at

a for any a  R2 . Therefore T is continuous on R2 . Similarly, T -1 can be shown to be continuous. Furthermore, Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution, therefore T is one-to-one. The columns of A span R2 , therefore T is onto. By Definition 1.1.3, T is a regular mapping and system (1.4.3) is a regular transformation by Definition 1.1.4, then it is an equivalent to system (1.4.2) ¯ = rt. with t Corollary 2.1.2. System (1.4.1) is equivalent to the following system    u  = u(1 - u) - (u - )v, (2.1.1)   v  =  (u - )v - v, Proof. This is a special case of Theorem (2.1.1), where h =  = 0 Remark 2.1.1. Note that  = R/K ,  = eK/r,  = d/r and  = h/(Kr) have same biological meanings as R, e, d and h. From (1.4.3).

2.2

Positive Equilibria

In this chapter we justify the existence of the equilibria of the model. We find the values of the equilibria with respect to the values of the parameters. Further, we provide the number of equilibria with respect to the values of the parameters.

Following the transformation detailed in the previous chapter, we show that the model can be expressed as system (1.4.3), which are both equiva12

lent. The latter having less parameters than the former. It is known that under regular transformations, the topological structures of solutions of a planar system near equilibria, including a variety of dynamics like saddles, topological saddles, nodes, saddle-nodes, foci, centers, or cusps, remain unchanged [1]. For these reasons, we consider system (1.4.3) when discussing the equilibria. Lemma 2.2.1. (u, v ) is an equilibrium of system (1.4.3) if and only if (u, v ) satisfies    u(1 - u) -  = 0   v = 0 or    

(2.2.1)

u(1 - u) - (u - )v -  = 0 (2.2.2)

  v = 0 and u =  + /. Proof. Consider the system (1.4.3), namely:    u  = u(1 - u) - (u - )v -    v  =  (u - )v - v By Definition (1.1.2), an equilibrium of system (1.4.3) must satisfy:     u(1 - u) - (u - )v -  = 0    (u - )v - v = 0

(2.2.3)

13

Suppose v = 0, then the system (2.2.3) becomes:    u(1 - u) -  = 0   v = 0 Suppose v = 0, then from the second equation of system (2.2.3) we have:

 (u - )v - v = 0 =  (u - ) -  = 0 = u =  + / Therefore, the system (2.2.3) becomes:    u(1 - u) - (u - )v -  = 0   v = 0 and u =  + /.

14

The following results provide the solutions of system (2.2.1) as well as the conditions for which they are positive solutions. It is shown that in order for the system to have positive solutions, the condition 0    1/4 is required. Lemma 2.2.2. Let  > 0,  > 0 and   0. Then the following assertions hold. (1) If  > 1/4, then (2.2.1) has no real solutions. (2) If  = 1/4, then (2.2.1) has a unique positive solution (1/2, 0). (3) If 0   < 1/4, then (2.2.1) has two positive solutions (u1 ( ), 0) and (u2 ( ), 0), where u1 ( ) = 1/2 - 1/4 -  and u2 ( ) = 1/2 + 1/4 -  (2.2.4)

Proof. From the first equation of system (2.2.1) we have: -u2 + u -  = 0 by solving the quadratic equation we find the solutions: u1 ( ) = 1/2 - 1/4 -  and u2 ( ) = 1/2 + 1/4 - 

system (2.2.1) has two solutions (u1 ( ), 0) and (u2 ( ), 0), where   0.

(1) Under the condition  > 1/4, we find that

1/4 -  is not a real

number. In this case, u1 ( ) and u2 ( ) are not real numbers, therefore system (2.2.1) has no real solutions. (2) Under the condition  = 1/4, we have (u1 ( ), 0) = (u2 ( ), 0) = (1/2, 0) is a unique solution of system (2.2.1). 15

(3) Under the condition 0   < 1/4, we have 1/2  u1 ( ) = 1/2 - 1/4 -   0 and u2 ( ) = 1/2 +

1/4 -  > 0, then 1/4 -  > 0

Therefore, (u1 ( ), 0) and (u2 ( ), 0) are positive solutions of system (2.2.1).

The following result gives the number of positive solutions of system (2.2.2). The range of parameters are determined for which the system has no real solution or a unique solution. We show that in order to ensure existence of the positive interior solution of system (2.2.2), one must restrict the prey refuge and harvesting rate to suitable intervals (0, 1 ) and [0, 0 ), respectively.

Notation: Let 0 = 1/2 - / , 1 = 1/2 + 0 and 0 := 0 (, ,  ) = For  > 0,  > 0 and   0, 0 = ( + / )(1 - ) and 0 = 1/4 - ( - 0 )2 . In fact, since / = 1/2 - 0 , we have: 0 = / +  1 - / +  = 1/4 - ( - 0 )2 . = 1/2 + ( - 0 ) 1/2 - ( - 0 ) (2.2.6) (2.2.5) ( +  )( -  -  ) . 2

Lemma 2.2.3. (1) Assume that one of the following conditions holds. (i)  > 0,  > 0,   0 and  > 1/4. (ii) 0 <  <  and   0 and 0   < 1/4. (iii) 0 <    ,  > 1 and 0   < 1/4. (iv ) 0 <    , 0    1 ,  = 0 if 0 > 0, and 0 <  < 1/4. Then (2.2.2) has no positive solutions. (2) If 0 <  <  , 0   < 1 and 0   < 0 , then (2.2.2) has a positive interior solution (u , v  ), where u =  + / and v  = (/ )(0 -  ). (2.2.7)

Proof. Substituting u =  + / = 1/2 +  - 0 into the first equation of (2.2.2), we have v= (1/2 +  - 0 )(1/2 -  + 0 ) -  u(1 - u) -  = = (/ )(0 -  ) u- 1/2 - 0 (2.2.8) and  = 0 . (1) It is sufficient to prove v < 0 under each of the conditions (i)-(iv ). If (i) holds, then  > 1/4 and by (2.2.6), 0  1/4 <  . By (2.2.8) that v < 0. If (ii) or (iii) holds, then  > 1 . It follows from (2.2.5) that 0 < 0. By (2.2.8), we have v < 0. If (iv ) holds, by (2.2.5) and (2.2.6), we have 0 < 0 < 1/4. Since 0 <  < 1/4, by (2.2.8) we have v < 0. (2) Since  <  , 0   < 1 and 0   < 0 , by (2.2.5) and (2.2.6), we have 0 < 0 < 1/4. Since 0   < 0 , by (2.2.8) we have v > 0.

Now we present the main result of existence of the equilibria. Below, Theorem 2.2.4 gives the number of equilibria for the entire range of parameters , ,  and  . We find that there are indeed three potential equilibrium points; two boundary and one interior. The results of this section will be used in the following chapter when discussing the local stability of each equilibrium. Combining Lemmas 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 along with definition 1.1.2, we obtain our main result on the number of positive equilibria of system (1.4.3). Theorem 2.2.4. (1) If  > 0,  > 0,   0 and  > 1/4, then system (1.4.3) has no positive equilibria. (2) If  > 0,  > 0,   0 and  = 1/4, then system (1.4.3) has a unique equilibrium (1/2, 0). (3) If one of the following conditions hold: (i) 0 <  <  and   0 and 0   < 1/4. (ii) 0 <    ,  > 1 and 0   < 1/4. (iii) 0 <    , 0    1 ,  = 0 if 0 > 0, and 0 <  < 1/4. then system (1.4.3) has two positive equilibria (u1 ( ), 0) and (u2 ( ), 0). (4) If 0 <  <  , 0   < 1 and 0   < 0 , then system (1.4.3) has three equilibria: (u1 ( ), 0), (u2 ( ), 0) and (u , v  ). Proof. For (u, v ) to be an equilibrium of system (1.4.3), by Lemma 2.2.1, it is required to be a solution to either system (2.2.1) or system (2.2.2). Considering this, we prove the claims of the theorem: (1) Under the conditions  > 0,  > 0,   0 and  > 1/4, by Lemma 2.2.2 (1) and Lemma 2.2.3 (1) - (i) we see that system (2.2.3) has no positive 18

solutions, therefore system (1.4.3) has no positive equilibria. (2) Under the conditions  > 0,  > 0,   0 and  = 1/4, by Lemma 2.2.2 (2) and Lemma 2.2.3 (1) - (i), system (2.2.3) has a unique positive solution (1/2, 0), therefore, system (2.2.2) has a unique equilibrium (1/2, 0) (3) Under either condition (i), (ii) and (iii), by Lemma 2.2.2 (3) and Lemma 2.2.3(1) - (ii), (1) - (iii) and (1) - (iv ), system (2.2.3) has two positive solutions (u1 ( ), 0) and (u2 ( ), 0), therefore system (1.4.3) has two positive equilibria (u1 ( ), 0) and (u2 ( ), 0). (4) Under the conditions 0 <  <  , 0   < 1 and 0   < 0 , by Lemma 2.2.2 (3) and Lemma 2.2.3(2), system (2.2.3) has three positive solutions (u1 ( ), 0) and (u2 ( ), 0) and (u , v  ), therefore system (1.4.3) has three positive equilibria (u1 ( ), 0) and (u2 ( ), 0) and (u , v  ).

Remark 2.2.1. Theorem 2.2.4 is new and provides the conditions under which the number of positive equilibria of (1.4.3) can be justified. Also, Theorem 2.2.4 (i) and the proof of Lemma 2.2.3 (i) show that if  > 1/4, then the predator population becomes extinct. Hence, the harvesting rate  must be required to be less than or equal to 1/4 to ensure co-existence of prey and predator populations. As a special case of Theorem 2.2.4, we obtain the following new result on the number of positive equilibria of (2.1.1). Corollary 2.2.5. (1) If either 0 <  <  and   0 or 0 <    and  > 1 , then (2.1.1) has two positive solutions (0, 0) and (1, 0). 19

(2) If 0 <  <  and 0   < 1 , then (2.1.1) has three equilibria: (0, 0), (1, 0) and (u , v  ) = ( + /, 0 / ) =  + /, (1 + / )(1 - ) . Proof. The result (1) follows from Theorem 2.2.4 (3) with the conditions (ii) and (iii), and the result (2) follows from Theorem 2.2.4 (4). Remark 2.2.2. The equilibrium (u , v  ) of (2.1.1) was obtained in [24], also see [6, Thoerem B]. The number of positive equilibria of (2.1.1) was not discussed in [6, 24].

Local Stability Analysis

In this chapter, we analyze the local stability of each positive equilibrium of (1.4.3) in order to understand the long term behaviour of the model. Recall the methods discussed in Section 1.2 of Chapter 1, namely from [1, 2, 27]. Now, we use the theoretical results to study phase portraits near each of the positive equilibria of (1.4.3).

For later use within this chapter, we will refer to the following equations which are determined by system (1.4.3) and the Jacobian matrix (1.2.2):

 A(u, v ) = 

1 - 2u - v v

-(u - ) u -  - 

 , (2.3.1)

|A(u, v )| = (1 - 2u - v )(u -  -  ) + v (u - ),

(2.3.2)

tr(A(u, v )) = 1 - 2u + u - v -  - .

(2.3.3)

We study now the stability of the boundary equilibria found in the previous chapter, (u1 ( ), 0) and (1/2, 0). The three theorems within this section

21

analyze each case of boundary equilibrium (1/2, 0), (u1 ( ), 0) and (u2 ( ), 0), respectively.

For convenience, we reiterate the notation introduced in the previous chapter: 0 := 1/2 - /, 1 := 1/2 + 0 and 0 := 1/4 - ( - 0 )2 .

The following theorem contains the results pertaining to the equilibrium (1/2, 0), which proves the equilibrium to be a saddle-node or a topological saddle under suitable conditions. Theorem 2.3.1. (1) Assume that one of the following conditions holds, (i) 0 <  < 2 , and   0. (ii) 0 < 2   ,   0 and  = 0 . Then (1/2, 0) is a saddle-node of (1.4.3) with  = 1/4. (2) If 0 < 2   <  and  = 0 , then (1/2, 0) is a topological saddle of (1.4.3) with  = 1/4. Proof. By (2.3.2), and (2.3.3), we have |A(1/2, 0)| = 0 and tr(A(1/2, 0)) = /2 -  -  =  (0 - ). (1) If 0 <  < 2 , then 0 < 0, so (i) implies tr(A(1/2, 0)) < 0 and (ii) implies tr(A(1/2, 0)) = 0. To apply Lemma 1.2.2, we change the equilibrium (1/2, 0) to the origin (0, 0) by using the change of variables u1 = u - 1/2 and

22

v1 = v . Noting that  = 1/4, the system (1.4.3) becomes    u 1 = u  = (u1 + 1/2)[1 - (u1 + 1/2)] - [(u1 + 1/2) - ]v1 - 1/4     (2.3.4) = -u2 1 - u1 v1 + 1 v1 ,      v 1 = v  =  (u1 + 1/2 - )v1 - v1 = u1 v1 + v1 , where  =  (0 - ) and 1 =  - 1/2. Let u2 = u1 - 1 v1 and v2 = v1 , Then the system (2.3.4) becomes u  2 = u  1 - 1 v  1 =  (-u2 1 - u1 v1 + 1 v1 ) - 1 (u1 v1 + v1 ) = -u2 1 - ( + 1  )u1 v1 = - u2 + 1 v2

u2 + 1 v2 2 v2 + v2 = v2 + (/ )u2 v2 + (1 / )v2 . 

:=  = 0 and a20 := -1/ = 0, by Lemma 1.2.2, (1/2, 0) is a

saddle-node.
1 (2) If 0 < 2   <  and  = 0 , then |A( 2 , 0)| = 0, tr(A( 1 , 0)) = 0 2

and  A(u, v ) =  0 -/ 0 0   = 0 0 0 0  .

Since  = 0 ,  = 0 and by (2.3.4), we have    u  1 = -u2 1 - u1 v1 + 1 v1 ,   v  1 = v1 u1
 Let u2 = u1 , v2 = u  1 = -u2 1 - u1 v1 + 1 v1 and  = 1/1 . Then

The following theorem contains the results pertaining to the equilibrium (u2 ( ), 0), which proves the equilibrium to be a saddle, unstable node or a saddle-node under suitable conditions. Theorem 2.3.2. (1) If one of the following conditions holds, ; (i) 0 < /2   ,   0 and 0   < 1 4 (ii) 0 <  < /2 and   0 and 0   < 1 ; 4 (iii) 0 <  < /2, 0   < 0 and 0   < 0 ; then (u1 ( ), 0) is a saddle of (1.4.3). (2) If 0 <  < /2, 0   < 0 and 0 <  < 1/4, then (u1 ( ), 0) is an unstable node of (1.4.3). (3) If 0 <  < /2, 0   < 0 and  = 0 , then (u1 ( ), 0) is a saddle-node of (1.4.3). Proof. By (2.3.2) with (u, v ) = (u1 ( ), 0) and u1 ( ) = 1/2 - have, |A(u1 ( ), 0)| = (1 - 2u1 ( ))(u1 ( ) -  -  ) = 2 1/4 -  (/2 -  -  ) -  = 2 1/4 -  (0 - ) - 1/4 -  (2.3.8) 1/4 -  , we

1/4 -  .

(1) If (i) or (ii) holds, then 0 -   0. By (2.3.8), we have |A(u1 ( ), 0)| < 0. If (iii) holds, then by  < 0 , we have (0 - )2 < 1/4 -  and 0  0 -  < 1/4 - .

This, together with (2.3.8), implies |A(u1 ( ), 0)| < 0. 26

(2) Since 0   < 0 and 0 <  < 1/4, we have (0 - )2 > 1/4 -  > 0 and 0 -  > 1/4 - . (2.3.9)

This, together with (2.3.8), implies |A(u1 ( ), 0)| > 0. Let (u, 0) = [tr(A(u, 0))]2 - 4|A(u, 0))| for u  0.

Then by (2.3.2) and (2.3.3) with (u, v ) = (u, 0)), we have: (u, 0) = (1 - 2u) + (u - ( +  ))
2

- 4(1 - 2u)[u - ( +  )]

= (1 - 2u)2 - 2(1 - 2u)[u - ( +  )] + ( +  )2 = [(1 - 2u) - 2(u - ( +  ))]2  0. It follows that (u1 ( ), 0)  0. By (2.3.3) with (u, v ) = (u1 ( ), 0), we have tr(A(u1 ( ), 0)) = 1 - 2u1 ( ) + u1 ( ) -  -  = 2 1/4 -  +  1/2 - 1/4 -  -  -  1/4 -  . (2.3.11) (2.3.10)

= 2 1/4 -  +  0 - ) -

This, together with (2.3.9), implies tr(A(u1 ( ), 0)) > 0. The result follows from Lemma 1.2.1 (ii). (3) Since 0   < 0 and  = 0 , we have (0 - ) - 1/4 -  = 0. By 

(2.3.8) and (2.3.11), |A(u1 ( ), 0)| = 0 and tr(A(u1 ( ), 0)) > 0. Let u2 = u - u1 ( ) and v2 = v . Note that 1 - 2u1 ( ) = 1 - 4 and

27

u1 ( )[1 - u1 ( )] =  . Then the first equation of (1.4.3) becomes u  2 = (u2 + u1 ( ))[1 - (u2 + u1 ( ))] - [(u2 + u1 ( )) - ]v2 -  = -u2 2 - u2 v2 + [1 - 2u1 ( )]u2 + [ - u1 ( )]v2 + u1 ( )[1 - u1 ( )] -  = -u2 2 - u2 v2 + 1 - 4u2 + [ - u1 ( )]v2 (2.3.12)

= -u2 2 - u2 v2 + u2 + 1 v2 , where  =

 1 - 4 and 1 =  - u1 ( ). By (2.2.6) with 0 > , we have 1/4 - 0 = 1/2 - (0 - ) =  + /

u1 ( ) = u1 (0 ) = 1/2 -

and u1 ( ) -  -  = 0. This, together with the second equation of (1.4.3), implies v  2 =  (u2 + u1 ( ) - )v2 - v2 = u2 v2 + [u1 ( ) -  -  ]v2 = u2 v2 . (2.3.13) Let u3 = u2 + 1 v2 and v3 = v2 . Then u2 = (u3 - 1 v3 )/ and (2.3.12)-(2.3.13) becomes u  3 = u  2 + 1 v  2 =  (-u2 2 - u2 v3 + u3 ) + 1 u2 v3 = -u2 2 + (1 -  )u2 v3 + u3 1 1 = - [u3 - 1 v3 ]2 + (1 -  )(u3 - 1 v3 )v3 + u3   2 1 2 21 + 1 -   2 + 1 - 1 2 = - u3 + u3 v3 - 1 v3 + u3 ,     1 2  v 3 = v  2 = [u3 - 1 v3 ]v3 = - v + u3 v3 .   3 

28

Let u4 = v3 and v4 = u3 . Then the above system becomes u 4 = - 1 2  u + u4 v4 ,  4  2 1 2 21 + 1 -   2 + 1 - 1 2 v  4 = v4 - v4 + u4 v4 - 1 u4 .   

Since

:=  = 0 and a20 := -1 / = 0, it follows from Lemma 1.2.2 that

(u1 ( ), 0) is a saddle-node. Corollary 2.3.3. If  > 0,  > 0 and   0, then (0, 0) is a saddle of (2.1.1). Proof. By Theorem 2.3.2 (1) with  = 0, we see that the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) on  ,  and  are equivalent to the condition:  > 0,  > 0,   0. The result follows from Theorem 2.3.2 (1) with  = 0. Remark 2.3.1. Corollary 2.3.3 was proved in [7, Theorem 2.3] by using a different method. By Theorem 2.3.2, we see that the harvesting rate  > 0 affects the dynamical behavior of the model (1.4.3) near the equilibrium (0, 0). In particular, when 0   < 1/4, then Theorem 2.3.2 (2) and (3) are new. The following theorem contains the results pertaining to the equilibrium (u2 ( ), 0), which proves the equilibrium to be a saddle, stable node or a saddle-node under suitable conditions. Theorem 2.3.4. (1) Assume that one of the following conditions holds. (i) 0 <   /2, 0    0 and 0   < 1/4. (ii) 0 < /2 <  <  , 0   < 1 and 0   < 0 . 29

(iii) 0 <  < /2, 0 <  < 1 and 0   < 0 . Then (u2 ( ), 0) is a saddle of (1.4.3). (2) Assume that one of the following conditions holds. (i) 0 <  <  ,   0 and 0   < 1/4. (ii) 0 < /2 <    , 0    1 and 0 <  < 1/4. (iii) 0 <    ,  > 1 and 0   < 1/4. (iv ) 0 <   /2, 0 <   1 and 0 <  < 1/4. Then (u2 ( ), 0) is a stable node of (1.4.3). (3) Assume that one of the following conditions holds. (i) If 0 < /2 <    , 0    1 and  = 0 . (ii) 0 <   /2, 0 <   1 and  = 0 . Then (u2 ( ), 0) is a saddle-node of (1.4.3). Proof. By (2.3.2) with (u, v ) = (u2 ( ), 0) and u2 ( ) = 1/2 + have |A(u2 ( ), 0)| = (1 - 2u2 ( ))(u2 ( ) -  -  ) = -2 1/4 -  /2 +  = 2 1/4 -  -  -  1/4 -  . (2.3.14) 1/4 -  , we

1/4 -  ( - 0 ) -

(1) If (i) holds, then -0  0 and

1/4 -  > 0. It follows from (2.3.14)

that |A(u2 ( ), 0)| < 0. If (ii) or (iii), then  - 0 > 0. Since 0   < 0 , by (2.2.6) we have 0   < 0 = 1/4 - ( - 0 )2 and ( - 0 )2 < 1/4 -  . This implies 0 <  - 0 < 1/4 -  . By (2.3.14), we have |A(u2 ( ), 0)| < 0. By

Lemma 1.2.1 (1), (u2 ( ), 0) is a saddle of (1.4.3). 30

(2) We first prove |A(u2 ( ), 0)| > 0. By (2.3.14), we see that |A(u2 ( ), 0)| > 0 if and only if  > 0 and  > 0 . (2.3.15)

Hence, it is sufficient to show that under each of the conditions (i)-(iv ), (2.3.15) holds. In fact, (i) implies 0 < 1 < 0   and 0 < 0   ; (ii) implies 0 < 0   and 0  0 <  ; (iii) implies 0 < 0 < 1 <  and 0 < 0   and (iv ) implies 0  0 <  < 1 and 0  0 <  . Hence, we have proved |A(u2 ( ), 0)| > 0. By (2.3.10), (u2 ( ), 0)  0. By (2.3.3) with (u, v ) = (u2 ( ), 0) and (2.3.14), we have tr(A(u2 ( ), 0)) = 1 - 2u2 ( ) + u2 ( ) -  -  = -2 1/4 -  + /2 +  1/4 -  -  -  1/4 -  < 0. (2.3.16)

= -2 1/4 -  -   - 0 - = -2 1/4 -  - |A(u2 ( ), 0)| 2 1/4 - 

The result follows from Lemma 1.2.1 (ii). (3) Since 0 = 1/4 - ( - 0 )2 , under each of the condition (i) and (ii), by (2.3.14) and (2.3.16) with  = 0 , we have |A(u2 ( ), 0)| = 0 and tr(A(u2 ( ), 0)) < 0. Let u3 = u - u2 ( ) and v3 = v . Note that 2u2 ( ) - 1 =  1 - 4 and

31

u2 ( )[1 - u2 ( )] =  . Then the first equation of (1.4.3) becomes u  3 = (u3 + u2 ( ))[1 - (u3 + u2 ( ))] - [(u3 + u2 ( )) - ]v3 -  = -u2 3 - u3 v3 + [1 - 2u2 ( )]u3 + [ - u2 ( )]v3 + u2 ( )[1 - u2 ( )] -  = -u2 3 - u3 v3 + 1 - 4u3 + [ - u2 ( )]v3 (2.3.17)

= -u2 3 - u3 v3 + u3 + 1 v3 , where  =

 1 - 4 and 1 =  - u2 ( ). Under each of the conditions (i) and

(ii), we have  - 0 > 0. By (2.2.6) with  = 0 , we have u2 ( ) = u2 (0 ) = 1/2 + 1/4 - 0 = 1/2 +  - 0 =  + /.

This implies u2 ( ) = u2 (0 ) -  -  = 0. This, together with the second equation of (1.4.3), implies v  3 =  (u3 + u2 ( ) - )v3 - v3 = u3 v3 + [u2 ( ) -  -  ]v3 = u3 v3 . (2.3.18) Let u4 = u3 + 1 v3 , and v4 = v3 . Then u3 = (u4 - 1 v4 )/ and (2.3.17)(2.3.18) becomes u  4 = u  3 + 1 v  3 =  (-u2 3 - u3 v3 + u3 + 1 v3 ) + 1 u3 v4
2 =  (-u2 3 - u3 v4 + u4 ) + 1 u3 v4 = -u3 + (1 -  )u3 v4 + u4

1 1 = - [u4 - 1 v4 ]2 + (1 -  )(u4 - 1 v4 )v4 + u4   1 2 21 + 1 -  1 [(1 +  )1 -  ] 2 = - u4 + u4 v4 - v4 + u4 ,     1 2  v 4 = v  3 = [u4 - 1 v4 ]v4 = - v + u4 v4 .   4  32

Let u5 = v4 and v5 = u4 . Then the above system becomes u 5 = - 1 2  u + u5 v5 ,  5  1 2 21 + 1 -  1 [(1 +  )1 -  ] 2 v  5 = v5 - v5 + u5 v5 - u5 .   

Since

(u2 ( ), 0) is a saddle-node of (1.4.3). Corollary 2.3.5. (1) If either 0 <  <  with  = /2 and 0   < 1 or 0 <  = /2 and  = 0, then (1, 0) is a saddle of (2.1.1). (2) If either 0 <  <  and   0 or 0 <    and  > 1 , then (1, 0) is a stable node of (2.1.1). (3) If 0 <    and  = 1 , then (1, 0) is a saddle-node of (2.1.1). Proof. (1) The conditions in (1) are equivalent to the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) in Theorem 2.3.4 (1) with  = 0. The result (1) follows from Theorem 2.3.4 (1) with  = 0. The result (2) follows from (i) and (iii) of Theorem 2.3.4 (2) with  = 0 and the result (3) follows from Theorem 2.3.4 (2). Remark 2.3.2. Corollary 2.3.5 shows that the equilibrium (1, 0) can be a saddle, a stable node or a saddle-node for suitable choice of the refuge constant . However, [7, Theorem 2.3] shows that (1, 0) only is a saddle for all refuge values,   0, by using a different method. Figure 1 given in section 4 shows that (1, 0) can be a stable node or a saddle-node. We now study the phase portraits near the positive interior equilibrium (u , v  ) of system (1.4.3).

For convenience, we provide a summary of the the notation used in this section: 0 := 1/2 - /, 1 := 1/2 + 0 , 1 + 2  (,  )  , 12 2 (,  ) := 1 - 2  (,  )  , 12

(,  ) := [tr(A(u , v  ))]2 - 4|A(u , v  )| := max{ 4 2 } 2(1 +  ) 1 + 4  ,

The following theorem proves that (u , v  ) is stable, unstable or locally symptotically stable. Theorem 2.3.6. (1) Assume that one of the following conditions holds. (i) 0 <  < /2, 0   < 0 and 0   < 1 , where 1 =  2 / 2 + (1 - ). (ii) 0 <  <  , max{0, 0 }   < 1 and 0   < 0 . Then (u , v  ) is a locally asymptotically stable. (2) Assume that 0 <  < /2 and 0   < 0 . If  = 1 , then (u , v  ) is stable, and if 1 <  < 0 , then (u , v  ) is unstable. Proof. By (2.2.7) we have u -  -  = 0 and (2.3.1) becomes  A(u , v  ) =  1 - 2u - v v

We first prove that if 0 <  <  , 0   < 1 and 0   < 0 , then |A(u , v  )| =  (0 -  ) > 0. (2.3.20)

Indeed, |A(u , v  )| = v  (u - ) =  (/ )(0 -  )(/ ) =  (0 -  ) =  (0 -  ) > 0.

If max{0, 0 }   < 1 , then 0 -   0 and by (2.3.21), we have 0  1 . It follows from 0   < 0 that  - 1 < 0. By (2.3.22), tr(A(u , v  )) < 0. If 0   < 0 , then  2 / 2 < 1 <  2 / 2 + 0 (1 - 0 ) = 1/4. 35

By (2.3.21), 1 < 0 and by (2.3.22), tr(A(u , v  )) < 0. It follows from Lemma 1.2.1 (iv ) that (u , v  ) is locally asymptotically stable. The result (2) follow from (2.3.22) and Lemma 1.2.1 (iv ). Corollary 2.3.7. If 0 <  <  and 0   < 1 , then (u , v  ) is a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium of (2.1.1). Proof. The conditions (i) and (ii) with  = 0 of Theorem 2.3.6 (1) are equivalent to (i) 0 < /2 <  <  and 0   < 1 ; (ii) 0 <   /2, 0   < 1 and (iii) 0 <  < /2, 0   < 0 , which are equivalent to 0 <  <  and 0   < 1 . The result follows from Theorem 2.3.6 (1) with  = 0. Remark 2.3.3. Theorem 2.3.6 (1) provides the conditions on the prey refuge and harvesting rates under which the interior equilibrium (u , v  ) of (1.4.3) is locally asymptotically stable. Theorem 2.3.6 (1) with  = 0, that is, Corollary 2.3.7 improves [7, Lemma 2.2 and Theorem 2.5] with m = 1, where it is proved that (u , v  ) is locally asymptotically stable and globally asymptotically stable, respectively. Theorem 2.3.6 (2) and (3) are new results. In the following, we show that under suitable conditions on the parameters, (u , v  ) is a stable node of (1.4.3). Let (,  ) := [tr(A(u , v  ))]2 - 4|A(u , v  )| and for 0 <  <  , let  (,  ) =  2 - 8 2 + 4 2 . 36 (2.3.24) (2.3.23)

2.4

Discussion

We exhibit that both prey refuge  and the harvesting rate  heavily affect the positive equilibria and the local stability of the model (1.4.3). For example, if the harvesting rate  is strictly greater than 1/4, (1.4.3) has no positive equilibria, which implies that the mutual extinction of prey and predators occurs and the necessary condition for the two species to coexist is 0    43

1/4. We give all the ranges of the parameters under which (1.4.3) has a unique positive boundary equilibrium, two positive boundary equilibria, and a positive interior equilibrium. In particular, to ensure that positive interior equilibrium exists, both prey refuge  and harvesting rate  can not be too large, that is, they must satisfy   [0, 1 ) and   [0, 0 ). We prove that when  = 1/4, (1.4.3) has a unique positive equilibrium (1/2, 0), which is justified to be a saddle-node or topological saddle. When 0   < 1/4, (1.4.3) has two positive boundary equilibria, which may be saddle, unstable node, stable node or saddle-node, depending on the choices of prey refuge  and the harvesting rate  . In particular, when  = 0, we show that the boundary equilibria (0, 0) is a saddle, which is same as the result obtained in [7] by a different approach, while another equilibria (1, 0) could be saddle, stable node or saddle-node depending on the choices of prey refuge . However, the equilibria (1, 0) was proved in [7] only to be a saddle for arbitrary prey refuge . Our result shows that the result in [7] is not true in some cases, see Corollary 2.3.5. We show that the positive interior equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable and could be a stable node under suitable restrictions on the prey refuge and sufficiently small harvesting rate. The last results of Section 2.3, Theorem 2.3.6 and Theorem 2.3.13, are new.

Chapter 3 Numerical Simulations
In this chapter we provide numerical simulations for the main results obtained in Chapter 2. In particular, we provide evidence that the boundary equilibrium (1, 0) can be a stable node or a saddle-node respectively, depending on the values of the parameters. Also, we provide evidence that the interior equilibrium (u , v  ) can be locally asymptotically stable or a stable node depending on the values of the parameters. In all the examples in this chapter, we consider system (1.4.3) with the parameter  = 0, which corresponds to the following system:    u  = u(1 - u) - (u - )v,   v  =  (u - )v - v. In the following examples, we examine system (3.0.1) under specific parameter values for  ,  and . The parameters are determined by following the Theorems and Corollaries in Section 2.3, in order to demonstrate the results. 45
