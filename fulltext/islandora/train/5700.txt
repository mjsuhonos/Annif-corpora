Abstract
The effects of surfactant solubility and concentration-dependant fluid density on the stability of inclined thin film flows Master of Science 2016 Flavio Firmino Lunda Applied Mathematics Ryerson University An analytical investigation of the stability of a surfactant-laden liquid film with a free surface, flowing under the influence of gravity on an inclined plane, is conducted. This investigation focusses on the onset of instability of a steady equilibrium flow when the surfactant concentration along the surface affects surface tension, while at the same time, the concentration of surfactant in the bulk of the layer affects the mass density of the liquid. A linear stability analysis is carried out and an asymptotic solution is obtained for the growth rate of long perturbations. The results obtained reflect how the various control parameters influence the onset of instability.

Introduction
1.1 Background and literature review

The formation of propagating waves along an inclined free surface, as a model for interfacial instability, was established by Kapitza and Kapitza in their experiments with the gravity driven flow of uncontaminated thin fluid films [1]. Since then, numerous theoretical investigations have been performed to predict the critical conditions for the onset of instability. Benjamin [2] and Yih [3], were the first to accomplish this, by linearizing the governing equations, and asymptotically expanding them in powers of the wavenumber, as a small parameter. Such an approximation is accurate due to the fact that long-wave perturbations are the most unstable and are responsible for the onset of instability in the flow [1]. The major contributor to the instability of the inclined flow of a fluid layer with uniform thickness is inertia. If sufficient, inertia amplifies perturbations in the thickness of the layer leading to the formation of large amplitude waves propagating along the surface. Another important factor is the Marangoni effect: Variation in surface tension generates so called Marangoni stresses which cause fluid flow along the surface towards regions of higher surface tension. Variation in surface tension can be caused by the presence of chemical agents referred to as surfactants. Surfactants are surface-active compounds that lower the surface tension, and are known to significantly affect interfacial instabilities in falling fluid films. It was first demonstrated by Benjamin [4] and Whitaker [5] that if the surfactants are insoluble, i.e. the entire quantity is absorbed by the surface and does not dissolve into the bulk, then they act to stabilize the flow. Later theoretical investigations include the work of Blyth & Pozrikidis [6], Pereira et al. [7] and Pereira & Kalliadasis [8]. Laboratory observations also indicate the stabilizing effect on liquid film flows when doping them with even small amounts of surfactants. Some of the experiments that prove the dampening of waves by surfactants, include the investigations by Emmert & Pigford [9], Stirba & Hurt [10], and Tailby & Portalsky [11]. It turns out that most surfactants are soluble to some extent. In order to capture this effect, a theoretical model must include an equation for the bulk concentration of surfactant, and couple it to the equation for the surface concentration by capturing the absorption/desorption fluxes between the

surface and the bulk of the liquid layer. Karapetsas and Bontozoglou [12,13] have recently studied the stability of inclined flow contaminated with a soluble surfactant. They found that surfactant solubility enhances the flow instability.

1.2

Objective and outline

The study undertaken in this thesis is motivated by the expectation that the presence of dissolved surfactant in the bulk of the liquid layer will affect its mass density. We thus implement a mathematical model for surfactant-laden film flow, i.e. with the case of soluble surfactant, with a variable mass density which is a function of the solute concentration. The remainder of this chapter provides an introduction to some general theoretical aspects relevant to our topic, such as the flow equations for a fluid with variable properties and general features of the constitutive relations for surface tension and mass density. In chapter 2 we derive the governing equations and obtain a simple equilibrium solution corresponding to a steady flow that is uniform in the stream wise direction of the flow. We then perform a linear stability analysis of this equilibrium flow, obtaining asymptotic approximations based on the assumption of perturbations with small wavenumber. In chapter 3 we present and interpret our results, and finally, in chapter 4 we summarize our investigation.

1.3

General theoretical aspects

In general, the governing equations for the two-dimensional inclined flow of a Newtonian fluid with variable properties (viscosity and mass density) are given as the following [14] D + Dt  u w + x z =0  µ z  µ x u w + z x u w + z x . (1.1)

Equation 1.1 is the conservation of mass equation and equations 1.2 and 1.3 are the Navier-Stokes equations for the momentum conservation along the x-direction and the z -direction respectively. The notation

  + u x + w z represents the material derivative operator. Also,  denotes the mass

density of the fluid, while u = u(x, z, t) and w = (x, z, t) denote the fluid's velocity components in the x-direction and the z -direction, respectively. Additionally, p denotes the pressure, g denotes the acceleration due to gravity, µ denotes the dynamic viscosity and  is the inclination angle. For the purpose of our study, we require an equation of the concentration of surfactant in the bulk. We will use the following conservation of mass equation, which accounts for advective and diffusive transport of a contaminant dissolved in a flowing fluid

where  = (x, z, t) is the concentration of contaminant, and Db denotes the mass diffusivity in the For problems with variable mass density, it is customary to resort to a linear constitutive relation. Accordingly, for our investigation we will assume that the dependence of density on surfactant concentration is given by

 = 0 (1 +  ^ )

(1.5)

where, 0 is the density of the clean liquid without surfactant and  ^ is the solutal expansion coefficient. In our investigation we are assuming that the density of the solution increases as more surfactant dissolves in it, therefore we consider  ^ to be a nonnegative parameter. In general, surface tension is a function of the concentration of surfactant absorbed on the surface. However, since our focus is a linear stability analysis we will directly consider the linearized formulation. Linearizing about  = E we have  () =  (E ) + d d ( - E )
=E

(1.6)

where  is the surface tension,  is the surface concentration of surfactant and E is a reference value, which, in our analysis will be the value for the equilibrium solution. In most cases surface tension decreases with surfactant concentration, so we have d d  0.
=E

This quantity gives the rate of change of the surface tension and thus measures the significance of the Marangoni effect. We point out that in order to determine the explicit dependence on the equilibrium concentration a specific constitutive relation must be considered.

Mathematical Analysis
2.1 Governing equations

Figure 2.1 shows the flow configuration of a thin layer of fluid flowing down an impermeable inclined plane under the influence of gravity. The plane is inclined at an angle  with the horizontal. The fluid is assumed to be Newtonian and the flow is assumed to be two-dimensional and laminar. An x - z coordinate system is defined so that the x-axis points along the plane in the downhill direction and the z -axis points into the fluid. Meanwhile, the thickness of the fluid layer is given by h(x, t).

Figure 2.1: Schematic representation of a thin film flowing down an inclined plane As it has been explained, in this work we assume the fluid to have constant viscosity, but variable density. In order to obtain the equations of motion we apply the Boussinesq approximation whereby the

where the notation is consistent with that for equations 1.1 - 1.3 and  = 0 (1 +  ^ ) with  being the concentration of surfactants in the bulk and  ^ the solutal expansion coefficient. To these we append the equations for the surfactant concentration in the bulk    +u +w = Db t x z where Db is the mass diffusivity. We now turn to establishing boundary conditions at the interfaces of the film: the surface of the fluid layer, which is the interface with the ambient gas, and the bottom of the layer which is interface with the substrate (the solid plane on which the fluid is flowing). At the surface of the liquid film, located at z = h(x, t), the normal stress exerted by the flow is balanced by the pressure in the ambient gas and that is due to the surface tension. The corresponding condition is expressed as p = pair + 2µ 1+

where pair is the pressure in the ambient gas and  is the surface tension given by equation 1.6. On the other hand, the tangential stress exerted by the flow at the surface is balanced by the Marangoni stress due to the variation in surface tension. So, at z = h(x, t) we have h   + x x z h x

If it is assumed that the evaporation of the liquid is negligible, then a kinematic condition can be applied which requires that the normal velocity of the fluid at the surface equals the normal velocity of the surface. The formulation is w= h h +u t x at z = h(x, t).

For the conservation of surfactant absorbed by the surface we use the following advection-diffusion-

where (x, t) is the surface concentration of surfactant, Ds is the molecular diffusivity on the surface and Jba denotes the net flux of absorption of surfactant from the bulk to the surface. Now, the desorption flux is proportional to  while the absorption flux is proportional to 1 - concentration that the surface can hold. Consequently, we have Jba = k1 1 -    - k2 , at z = h(x, t)

where k1 and k2 are nonnegative proportionality constants referred to as the absorption reaction rate and the desorption reaction rate respectively. Of course, the surfactant flux to the surface must equal the flux from the bulk of the fluid.

At the impermeable substrate we apply the no-slip and no-penetration conditions, as well as requiring that the normal surfactant flux is zero. We thus have the following conditions at z = 0 u=w=  = 0. z

where E is an arbitrary constant. This solution corresponds to a steady flow that is uniform in the streamwise direction, i.e. with distance along the incline. The control parameters for this flow are E , the surface concentration of surfactant, , the scaled solutal expansion coefficient, s , the ratio of absorption to desorption rates which provides a measure of the solubility of the surfactant (the insoluble case corresponding to s  ),  , the inclination of the flow and Re, the Reynolds number which controls the flow rate.

2.2

Linear stability analysis

Our task now is to determine the stability of the steady solution obtained above, to which we will hence refer to from here on as the "equilibrium solution". To this end we carry out a linear stability analysis. Accordingly, we consider the perturbed equilibrium solution given by u = uE + u ~(x, z, t), w = w ~ (x, z, t), ~(x, z, t), p = pE + p ~ (x, t), where the perturbations are ~ x, t), h = 1 + h  = E +  ~(x, z, t),  = E + ( denoted by tilde. The perturbations are assumed to be infinitesimal, therefore, upon substituting the perturbed equilibrium into the problem we linearize with respect to the perturbations. We thus obtain the following equations ~ u ~ w + =0 x z Re u ~ duE u ~ + uE (z ) +w ~ t x dz = -Re p ~ 2u ~ 2u ~ ~ + + 2 + 3  x x2 z (2.9)

where E = 3(1 + E ). At z = 0 the conditions for the perturbations are ~z = u  ~=w ~ = 0. To further analyze the above linearized equations and boundary conditions, we consider the following normal modes: ~ (x, t) = eik(x-ct) , u h ~(x, z, t) = u ^(z )eik(x-ct) , w ~ (x, z, t) = w ^ (z )eik(x-ct) , p ~(x, z, t) = p ^(z )eik(x-ct) , ~= ^(z )(x, z, t)eik(x-ct)  ~ x, t) =  ^ eik(x-ct) ( (2.18) (2.19)

where k is a positive real number which coincides with the wavenumber of the perturbation, while c is a complex number, c = cR + ici . The real part, cR , equals the phase velocity of the perturbation, and kci , gives the temporal growth rate. In terms of the normal modes the perturbation equations become Dw ^ + ik u ^=0 (2.20)

At z = 0 we have ^(0) = 0. u ^(0) = w ^ (0) = D The next step is to eliminate the pressure from the problem. We begin by combining equations 2.21 and 2.22. Firstly, we apply the D operator to equation 2.21 and multiply equation 2.22 by -ik . This gives, respectively, ^ Re[ikDuE u ^ + ik (uE - c)Du ^ + DwDu ^ E + wD ^ 2 uE ] = -ikReDp ^ - k2 Du ^ + D3 u ^ + 3D and ^ k 2 Re(uE - c)w ^ = ikReDp ^ + ik 3 w ^ - ikD2 w ^ + 3ik cot . Adding these equations yields

Re[ik (uE - c)^ u + wDu ^ E ] + k2 u ^ - D2 u ^ + 2ikDw ^ - 3 (2.30)

Equation 2.20 disappears when the velocity disturbances are expressed in terms of the stream function relations u ~=
 z ik(x-ct) and w ~ = -  , the x . Therefore, when we apply the normal mode as  = (z )e

z -dependent factors of the velocity perturbations can be expressed in terms of the stream function as u ^ = D and w ^ = -ik . We can thus express the problem in terms of two dependent variables: (z ) ^(z ). From equation 2.29 we obtain an Orr-Sommerfeld type equation: and  ^ + 3ik cot  ^ = 0 (2.31) D4  - [ikRe(uE - c) + 2k 2 ]D2  + [ik 3 Re(uE - c) + k 4 + ikReD2 uE ] + 3D while the other differential equation is equation 2.23 expressed as ^= ik (uE - c) 1 ^ - k2  ^).

The boundary conditions at z = 0 are ^(0) = 0. (0) = D(0) = D (2.38)

The problem given by equations 2.31 - 2.38 constitutes an eigenvalue problem with c acting as the parameter that is to be assigned characteristic values. Solving for this quantity will reveal if, for a given set of flow parameters, the perturbation with wavenumber k will be amplified or damped in time.

2.2.1

Asymptotic Analysis

We solve the eigenvalue problem 2.31 - 2.38 asymptotically as k  0. It should be mentioned that the results will only be accurate for determining the stability of very long perturbations. However, we expect these perturbations to be the most unstable, and thus be the ones that trigger instability in the equilibrium flow. Therefore, the asymptotic analysis is sufficient for predicting the onset of instability for the equilibrium flow, which is the goal of this investigation. We begin the process by expanding all the unknown quantities of the problem in powers of k :  = 0 (z ) + k 1 (z ) + k 2 2 (z ) ^ = 0 (z ) + k1 (z ) + k 2 2 (z )  ^ = 0 + k 1 + k 2 2 ,  = 0 + k1 + k 2 2 , c = c0 + kc1 + k 2 c2 .  The eigenvalue problem can actually be normalized and we can set 0 = 1 and 1 = 2 = 0. Substituting these expansions into the problem and collecting like terms in k leads to a hierarchy of simpler problems which can be solved sequentially.

D0 = 0 ^0. s (1 - E )0 = (1 + s E ) (2.44)

Solving this problem we find that 0 is constant, however the specific value can only be determined when solving the subsequent order problem. The solution for 0 is then obtained from equation 2.44, and, upon expressing E in terms of E , is given by ^ 0 = (1 - E )2 s 0 .  Integrating equation 2.39 and using conditions 2.40 - 2.42 we obtain the solution for 0 :  1 0 (z ) = - 0 z 3 + (E + 30 )z 2 , 2 2 which we then use in equation 2.43 to get c0 = E + 0 . This is the leading-order approximation to c, however it is real and thus does not offer any information regarding the temporal growth rate of the perturbation. Consequently, we must obtain a higher order term.

This equation contains 0 and the control parameters of the problem, and thus provides the solution for 0 that has not yet been determined.

We point out that this solution for 1 is in terms of 1 which has not yet been determined.

We solved this problem using Maple and obtained a formula for 1 . This formula is too long to present, but furthermore it is in terms of 1 which is determined by considering the next order problem. The O(k 2 ) problem In order to determine 1 we only require the O(k 2 ) terms from equations 2.32 and 2.36 which are respectively i[uE (z ) - c0 ]1 - ic1 0 = i 1 (D2 2 - 0 ), P eb 0<z<1 at z = 1.

We next substitute the current expression for 1 into this equation and solve for 1 . This is then put back into the expression for 1 which then contains the control parameters and also c1 . This is then inserted into equation 2.51 which can finally be solved for c1 to give a lengthy formula in terms of the control parameters of the problem. It turns out that Im(c1 ) is not identically equal to zero, and for a given set of parameters, if positive indicates that the perturbation is amplified, while if negative indicating that the perturbation is damped.

CHAPTER 2. MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS Neutral stability relation

2.2. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS

In order to analyize the effect of the parameters on the stability of the flow we consider Im(c1 ) = 0, which gives the state of neutral stability and describes the threshold between stability and instability. Specifically, we want to solve the neutral stability relation for the Reynolds number to get the critical value, Recrit , for the onset of instability in terms of the other control parameters. Since Re measures the effect of inertia which plays a destabilizing role, we know that the flow is stable if Re < Recrit and unstable otherwise. Now, it turns out that some of our current parameters, namely M , W e, P es , and P eb are implicitly dependent on Re. To make this dependence explicit we introduce the new parameters M a, Ka, Scs and Scb related to the previous parameters by We = M=

For all the numerical values that we considered for the parameters we found that the polynomial had only one positive real root. We took this value to be the critical Reynolds number.

Results
This chapter comprises of an analysis and overview of the Reynolds number for the onset of instability of the equilibrium flow, Recrit , as we determine the effect of the various parameters utilized in the problem. Due to its complicated nature, the formula for Recrit is analyzed by examining its plots as a function of the equilibrium surface concentration, E , for the various fixed values of the other parameters. Recall that we scale the surface concentration's maximum value to 1. Which means that, in this discussion, the range of E is from 0 to 1. However, the expression for the equilibrium bulk concentration, E is not defined when E = 1, so we adjust our interval to [0, 0.99] to prevent the associated numerical issues. In order to generate these plots we must specify an equation of state for the surface tension as a function of E . We employ the equation of state for surface tension proposed by Sheludko [16]:  () = 0 [1 + (1/3 - 1)]-3 , where 0 is the surface tension of the fluid without surfactant and  is the ratio of this quantity to that corresponding to the maximal packing of surfactants. In this case the Marangoni number in our formulation becomes M a = 3Ka(1/3 - 1)[1 + E (1/3 - 1)]-4 . (3.1)

For the basic problem where the surfactants are assumed to be insoluble, it has been shown [13, 17] that the resulting Marangoni effect dampens surface waves and thus counteracts the destabilizing effect of inertia. The fluid velocity at the surface of the layer is non-uniform if the surface undulates, and due to the advective transport of surfactant, concentration differences arise along the surface. It turns out that the surfactant concentration is maximized at the crests of the waves and minimized at the troughs. Since surface tension is weakened as the surfactant concentration increases, the Marangoni stresses pull fluid from the crests to the troughs decreasing the amplitude of the surface waves. We point out that if the density variation parameter, , is set to zero corresponding to the constant density case, our results coincide with those obtained by Karapetsas and Bontozoglou [13] once the

Interpretation and discussion of the results

In Figure 3.1 we show the critical Reynolds number as a function of E in the constant density case for various values of s . In the insoluble surfactant case (s  ) it can be seen that Recrit increases with E , indicating that increasing the equilibrium surfactant concentration stabilizes the flow. It turns out that the leading order term in the amplitude of the surface concentration perturbation is proportional to the equilibrium concentration (0 = 2E ), thus the concentration difference between crests and troughs increases with E amplifying the Marangoni stresses and stabilizing the flow. If the surfactant is soluble then the curve exhibits a maximum and increasing the equilibrium concentration destabilizes the flow if the values are sufficiently large. The surfactant flux from the surface into the bulk of the fluid layer is proportional to the concentration on the surface. So the effect is to reduce concentration differences along the surface which diminishes the Marangoni stresses destabilizing the flow. Consequently, it can also be seen that increasing the solubility (decreasing s ) lowers Recrit for every value of E and decreases the critical value where the maximum occurs. We now turn to investigating the effect of the density variation with surfactant concentration. The 18

relevant parameter is  which measures the rate of change of the fluid density with respect to concentra~ . Denoting tion. We begin by determining the perturbed fluid velocity at the surface of the film z = 1 + h this quantity by v , and expanding about z = 1 while discarding nonlinear perturbation terms we obtain v = uE (1) + u ~|z=1 . If we now introduce the normal modes we can relate the velocity perturbation to that of the surface position and obtain ~ = uE (1) + D0 (1)h ~ + O(k ). v = uE (1) + u ^(1)h Introducing the expressions for uE and 0 yields v= 3 3 ~ + O(k ). (1 + E ) + 3 + (0 + 2E ) h 2 2

If we consider a reference frame moving with the same velocity as the surface perturbation, i.e. c0 + O(k ) = 3 + (0 + 3E ) + O(k ), then the fluid velocity at the surface is given by 3 3 ~ + O(k ). v - c0 = - (1 + E ) - 0 + 3 + (0 + 2E ) h 2 2 (3.2)

Since this velocity is negative it is apparent that the wave propagates faster than the fluid flow. Fur~ is negative. So, in a reference frame where thermore, the difference is greater at the troughs, where h the surface disturbance is stationary the fluid velocity is maximized at the troughs and minimized at the crests. Now, since the system is at steady state in the moving reference frame, the surfactant flux (the product of velocity and concentration) is uniform in the streamwise direction. We can conclude then that the surfactant concentration is at a maximum at the crests and a minimum at the troughs of the surface perturbation. This gives rise to the stabilizing Marangoni stresses described above. The ~ dependence on  of the velocity variation from crest to trough is determined by the 0 term in the h coefficient, with 0 itself being a function of . We have obtained a formula for 0 , however this formula is too complicated to analyze. We have however examined its numerical values and have determined that 0 is in fact an increasing function of . We thus conclude that increasing  accentuates the velocity variation along the surface resulting in greater concentration differences which strengthens the surface tension stresses and stabilizes the flow. It should also be pointed out that an increase in fluid density also affects the flow rate. Calculating the flow rate for the equilibrium flow we obtain

It is evident that q increases with  which leads to inertial instability. We thus see that increasing  contributes to competing mechanisms affecting the stability of the flow. In Figure 3.2 we present Recrit versus E curves for different values of . For the smaller values of

E there is a slight decrease in Recrit with , while for sufficiently large values of E there is a reversal in the destabilizing roles played by density variation. In this case the increase in Recrit is much more pronounced, especially for the larger values of E . In Figure 3.3 we display Recrit curves for different values of the bulk Schmidt number, Scb . It turns out that the surface Schmidt number, Scs , has no significant effect on the results. We find that increasing Scb has a similar outcome to increasing  with the exception of the smaller E values where there is now no significant effect on the critical Reynolds number. So, increasing Scb has a significant effect on the critical Reynolds number for the larger values of E where it acts to increase it. Now, an increase in the Schmidt number can be interpreted as a lowering of the solutal conductivity of the fluid. This has the effect of weakening the transport of surfactant away from the surface. As a result concentration differences are maintained along the surface which has a stabilizing effect. Figure 3.4 illustrates the effect of the inclination of the film. As cot  is increase the inclination is decreased and a greater Reynolds number is required to generate sufficient inertia to destabilize the flow. The effect of the rate of change in surface tension with respect to surfactant concentration is presented in Figures 3.5 and 3.6. In our formulation the scaled rate of change is measured by the Marangoni number, M a. An increase in this quantity strengthens the Marangoni stresses and stabilizes the flow. 20

Conclusion
In this thesis we considered the stability of gravity-driven liquid film flow affected by the presence of surfactants. We implemented a mathematical model that captures the solubility of surfactant from the surface into the bulk of the liquid layer, and as novel extension, the model also allows for a variable density for the surfactant solution, which increases with surfactant concentration. A linear equation of state is assumed for the density, with the rate of change with concentration being the control parameter. We obtained an equilibrium solution to this model corresponding to a steady flow uniform in the streamwise direction. A linear stability analysis was employed to predict the critical conditions for the onset of instability. Specifically, we obtained a formula for neutral stability which was solved for the critical Reynolds number in terms of the other control parameters of the problem, namely, the inclination, the molecular diffusivity of the liquid, the equilibrium concentration of surfactant on the surface of the liquid layer, the rate of change of surface tension with surfactant concentration on the surface, the rate of change of the density with surfactant concentration in the bulk of the layer and the solubility of the surfactant. The principal objective of our study was to draw conclusions regarding the effect of the variable fluid density. It turns out that increasing the rate of variation of the density with surfactant concentration has competing effects on the stability of the flow. On the one hand, increasing the density elevates the flow rate which results in greater inertia which is a contributor to instability. On the other hand, our analysis demonstrates that increasing the variation in density increases the variation in fluid velocity along the surface, which enhances the Marangoni effect leading to a higher instability threshold. Our results indicate that for lower levels of surfactant concentration on the surface, the instability mechanism is slightly more dominant, and increasing the density variation parameter results in lower critical Reynolds numbers. However, if the equilibrium concentration of surfactant absorbed by the surface is sufficiently high, then there is a reversal in the destabilizing role played by density variation. Our results reveal that the molecular diffusivity of the liquid also has a significant impact on the stability of the flow. In particular, we found that if the equilibrium surface concentration of surfactant is sufficiently high, then increasing the diffusivity of the dissolved surfactant in the bulk of the fluid layer destabilizes the flow. The physical conclusion is that an increase in the molecular conductivity of the 25

The results therefore, is the smoothing of concentration variation along the surface, and consequently the weakening of the Marangoni effect which destabilizes the flow.
