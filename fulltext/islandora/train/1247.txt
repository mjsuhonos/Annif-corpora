Abstract

SIMULATION, SYSTEM ANALYSIS, AND OPTIMIZATION OF NEMATIC BIPOLAR DROPLET IN POLYMER DISPERSED LIQUID CRYSTAL FILMS

Master of Applied Science, 2008 Chemical Engineering, Ryerson University

Polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) films play an important role in liquid crystal display technology. PDLC films are used in devices such as switchable windows, complex billboards, and flat panel televisions. PDLC films consist of nematic bipolar droplets dispersed randomly in a polymer matrix. In this work, the effect of droplet shape, physical properties, and external field strength is examined on the performance of PDLC films. Finite element method (FEM) and finite difference method (FDM) are used to model a single droplet with external field applied parallel to the droplet axis of symmetry. Results of previous simulations with FEM are reproduced and compared with those with FDM. Genetic algorithm is employed to determine the optimum aspect ratio, and elastic constant ratio for the droplet, and external field strength with respect to minin1um energy, response time, and relaxation time.

A brief description of liquid crystals and polymer dispersed liquid crystal films is given in section 1.1. Section 1.2 is about contribution made by this investigator to this field. Section 2 is the literature survey. The method of simulation and optimization is described in section 3, and results are described in section 4. Lastly, conclusions are presented in section 5.

1.10 Liquid Crystals and PDLC Films
1.1 . 1. What are Liquid Crystals?
Normally, it is expected that matters exist in three phases of solid, liquid, and gas. However, there are so1ne materials which do not meet the necessary requirements of any of these three categories. Liquid crystals are not quite liquid and not quite solid. Physically, they are observed to flow like liquids, but they have some properties of crystalline solids. Liquid crystals can be considered to be crystals which have lost some or all of their positional order (where molecules are arranged in any sort of ordered lattice), while maintaining full orientation order (where molecules are mostly pointing in the same direction). Figure! is a representation of liquid crystal and two phases of liquid and solid. There are different liquid crystalline phases and the existence of these different liquid crystalline phases was discovered in 1888 by an Austrian botanist named Friedrich Reinitzer [1]. Although many scientists came across this liquid crystal state earlier from 1850's to 1888, no complete documentation was reported until Friedrich Reinitzer reported his findings on an organic
1

substance (cholesterol). He observed that upon heating this substance to 145.5 ░C a cloudy liquid formed. Further heating to 178.5 ░C turned the substance clear, like normal liquids. This phase was described as the liquid crystal phase; this observation was the beginning of research on liquid crystal phase. There are different types of liquid crystals; Such as smectic, cholestric, and nematic liquid crystals. In a smectic state, in which a number of important structural vruiations exist (two typical smectic phases are presented in Figure 2), there is more positional order than nematic and cholestric phases. A smectic is a layered structure with the molecules oriented parallel or tilted relative to the normal layer. They are characterized by absence of positional order within the layers; the molecules have some freedom to move within the layers, while them, as in all smectic phases, are n1uch less free to move between layers. These smectics can therefore be said to be stacks of two-dimensional fluids, but they behave as crystalline across the layers. The absence of in-layer order contributes to their high potential for future electro-optic applications. The two best known of these ruиe smectic A, in which the molecules align perpendicular to the layer planes, and sn1ectic C, where the alignment of the molecules is at some arbitrary angle to the normal.

Another type of liquid crystals is cholesetric liquid crystal which is typically con1posed of chiral (where the molecules are not similar to their mirror picture) nematic molecules containing a chiral center which produces intermolecular forces that favor alignment between molecules at a slight angle to one another. Figure 3.a shows a picture of choesteric phase. Nematics are another type of liquid crystals which are polarizable rod-like organic molecules on the order of 20 Angstroms in length. Nematic comes from a Greek prefix nemato meaning threadlike and is used here because the molecules in the liquid align themselves into a threadlike shape. In the nematic phase the molecules are free to move in all directions (i.e. there is no positional order of the centers of mass), but on the average they keep their long axes locally parallel to each other (Figure 3.b). Director is defined as the local average direction of molecules inside the droplet.

A nematic liquid crystal is a liquid that causes the polarization of light waves to change as the waves pass through the liquid. The extent of the change in polarization depends on the intensity of an applied electric field. nematic molecules have a tendency to organize themselves in a parallel fashion and their light transmission properties can be deliberately varied as a function qf applied external voltage. As a result they demonstrate interesting and useful optical properties. nematic liquids are used in liquid crystal displays (LCDs), such as those found in digital wristwatches and 1nany consutner electronic devices. A typical nematic liquid crystal produces a 90-degree shift in the polarization of the light passing through when there is no electtic field present. When a voltage is applied, an electlic field is produced in the liquid, affecting the orientation of the molecules. This causes the polarization shift to be reduced. The effect is slight at low voltages, and increases as the voltage {and the resulting field strength) increases. When the applied voltage reaches a certain level, the polarization shift disappears entirely.

1. 1.2. What are PDLC Films?
Polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) films are relatively new composite materials which have made a revolution in the world of LCD technology, all because of PDLC's excellent electro-optical features. These films consist of low molecular weight bipolar nematic liquid crystals, dispersed in a polymer matrix (Figure 4). Polymer-dispersed liquid crystals are prepared in different ways including: encapsulation (emulsification) and phase separation; the latter process has become the primary method for manufacturing these films. Among the factors influencing the properties of the PDLC material are the shape of the droplet, the types of polymer and liquid crystal used, and cooling and heating rates in production. Different separation methods are thermal induced phase separation (TIPS), polymerization induced phase separation (PIPS), and solvent induced phase separation [3, 4, and 5].

Figure 4. Polymer dispersed liquid crystal film [2]

PDLC films have an interesting characteristic which makes them applicable in electro-optical devices such as billboards and flat panel televisions (Figure 5). These films appear milky white when there is no electric field applied to them due to the refractive index mismatch encountered by incoming light at the liquid crystal/polymer interface. According to Wu et al. [6] the refractive index (n0 ) of bipolar droplets in a polymer dispersed liquid crystal film is greater than the refractive index n0 of a uniform director configuration. So, light is scattered when it is applied to the filn1 and the film appears opaque because: (n0 ) > n0 = n P
и

Here n P is the refractive

index of polymer matrix. When the external field is applied to the film, (n0 ) reduces and approaches n0
=nP. Right after

(n0 ) =n0=nP the film becomes transparent and light is no more scattered while passing

through the film. Thus, in the on state, if the ordinary refractive index of the liquid crystal within the droplet is sufficiently dose to the index of the polymer matrix material ( n0
~ n P ),

the incoming light is

no longer scattered and the PDLC film becomes clear. When an electtic field is applied across the film, the liquid crystal molecules

align with their long-molecular axis parallel to the field direction. In Figure 6 the PDLC film is shown when the electric field is on/off. The performance criteria for PDLC films are: 1) Short relaxation time; after the electric field is switched off, film should go back to its opaque condition fast. 2) Short response time; there must be small time interval between the time when electric field is switched on and when the film turns completely transparent. 3) Low switching field strength; the film should be efficient and change from opaque to transparent with a low external field. The performance of PDLC films depend on many factors, such as the initial orientation of the liquid crystals [5], the shape [8], and the size [9] of the droplet.

1.23 Objective of this work
There have been computational and experimental studies on performance of a nematic bipolar droplet in an external field [9, 11, and 32]. In the works by Chan [11] the effect of aspect ratio of a bipolar droplet, and external field strength is studied on relaxation time of nematic droplet. He used finite element method (FEM) for his simulation. Rudhardt et al. [9] have observed the response and relaxation time of a bipolar nematic droplet to an external field. These researchers verified the simulations reported by Chan [11]. Wu et al. [32] have studied the response and relaxation tin1e for a droplet, and operating voltages of light shutters fonned from PDLC films. They concluded that in PDLC films with nematic bipolar droplet, aspect ratio is an important

8

factor in perfonnance of the light shutter. Besides, it has always been interesting to have PDLC films with small field strength to save in energy costs. The properties of liquid crystal droplet and polyn1er matrix affect the performance of a PDLC film. In this work, the effect of physical properties of a nematic bipolar droplet isи. studied on performance of PDLC filn1s. A single droplet is simulated by finite difference method (FDM) because it is a faster method in comparison to previous simulations by FEM. Results of simulation is compared with previous simulation done by Chan [ 11] for verification. By using genetic algorithm the optin1um physical properties of nematic bipolar droplet, and optimum external field strength is defined subject to the constraints of small relaxation time, small response time, and small external field strength. By controlling the temperature and size of molecules used in preparation of PDLC films, it is possible to control the aspect ratio or elastic constant ratio of the nematic droplet in PDLC films.

The model incorporates an external magnetic field to induce director, because the magnetooptical response of PDLC films has the same characteristic properties as the electro-optical response [lO].The external field direction is parallel to the droplet axis of symmetry to minimize the field strength required for reorientation of molecules.

2. Literature review
The first polymer dispersed liquid crystal devices were demonstrated by James Fergason [12]. Fergason together with Schadt and Helfrich invented the twisted netnatic liquid crystal display. In the experin1ental parts, Fergason noted that mixing a nen1atic liquid crystal with a water-based solution of polyvinylalcohol enabled him to cast a turbid, flexible film. This electro-optical paint was coasted onto a plastic sheet, and the plastic sheet was coated with indium-tin oxide (ITO). After drying the fihn, another sheet of ITO-based film was placed on the other side of film. By applying an AC voltage across the turbid film it became clear, providing a means to a flexible, large area optical shutter. Fergason [12] filed his first U.S. patent in this area in 1981, which was granted in 1984.

Heilmeier [13] was working at David Sarnoff Research Center in 1963 when he and Richard Williams published a report suggesting the use of liquid crystal materials for display. Heilmeier's liquid crystal displays used DSM or dynanric scattering n1ethod, wherein an electrical charge was applied which rearranged the molecules so that they scatter light. Heilmeier used the twisted nematic field effect of liquid crystals invented by James Fergason in 1969 and introduced to the market in 1971; Heilmeier is credited with setting the ball in motion for LCDs use in calculators, watches, computers and other instruments. In 1968, he was recognized by RCA with its prestigious David Sarnoff A ward.

Doane and Zumer [14] stated that when electric-field is applied to the mixture of an epoxy resin and liquid crystals the scattering effect is cured. This observation led to phase separation methods for making polymer dispersed liquid crystal film from liquid precursor. PDLC films are

10

fabricated by them1al-induced, polymerization-induced, and shear-induced phase separation methods and also emulsification method [3, 4, and 5]. Besides, Doane and Zummer [14] named 'Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystals' and 'PDLC' for these materials.

2.le Optical properties of PDLCs
The interesting optical properties of PDLC fihns captured the attention of n1any researchers. Aphonin et al. [15] studied the optical properties of a stretched PDLC film with bipolar nematic droplet.

Zhao et al. [ 16] investigated the order parameter of a stretched PDLC film as a function of strain by means of in framed dichorism. But he did not consider the effect of poly1ner orientation surrounding the droplet where Amimori et al.[17] stated that polymer orientation strongly

influence liquid crystal molecules at the planar surface and in display applications and optical properties of LCDs. Amimori et al. [17] studied the Opt-mechanical properties of stretched PDLC films for scattering polarized applications. They have considered the effect of the polymer orientation surrounding the droplet. They also applied Monte Carlo simulation based on the Lebwohl-Lasher model to explain the subtle influence of polyn1er olientation on liquid crystals.

11

Higgins et al. [18] studied an individual PDLC droplet and its field-induced dynanrics by highresolution near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) and multiphoton-excited fluorescence microscopy (MPEFMO).

Xie and Higgins [19] studied on Fihns of netnatic LC dispersed in a poly (isobutyl methacrylate) matrix when induced by an electric field applied laterally across each droplet, using two parallel copper wires embedded in the film.

2.2. Dynamic behavior of nematic droplet in an external field
The complex hydrodynamic behavior of a nematic liquid crystalline system can be described by two vector fields depending upon space and time: the director unit vector (nb n 2_, n3) describes the local orientation of the mesogenic phase, and the velocity vector (v 1, v2, v3). Leslie [20] and Ericksen [21] first derived the constitutive equations that described the time evolution of incompressible isothermal nematic fluids, i.e. the nematic hydrodynamic behavior for some defined initial and boundary conditions. Leslie-Ericksen (LE) equations are widely used in describing the behavior of nen1atics, especially for the numerical solutions.

Later on, Baleo, et al. [22] used finite element method to numerically solve the LE equations in two dimensions, considering many simplifying assun1ptions. These researchers described the behavior of anisotropic viscous fluids in Complex geometries including converging and diverging channels, expansion and contraction flows, as well as flow around spherical obstacles 12

Han and Rey [23] conducted a numerical analysis of LE equations for rectilinear shear flows of a model rigid-rod nematic polymer in low molar mass nematics and nematic liquid crystalline polymers. They simulated the liquid crystal droplet by using Galerkin finite element method

Chan and Rey [24] discussed a synthesis of LE theory and Euler-Lagrange equations for treating the reorientation dynamics in bipolar nematic droplet. Gomes and Polimeno [25] nun1erically simulated nematic liquid crystal in a cylindrical sample rotating around its axis at a constant angular velocity and subject to a magnetic field by solving LE equation. They achieved the computational solution of the problem in three dimensions while they considered the influence of initial and boundary conditions. A series of theoretical studies on the solution of LE equations in 2 dimensions by numerical methods were conducted by Polimeno, et al. [26] assuming that both .the director and velocity fields are constrained to lie in a planar section of the sample. Chan [27] has shown that PDLC films with elongated bipolar droplet axis of symmetry normal to the film plane or parallel to the external field direction results in minimum required switching field strength in the on state and relaxation time in the off state. On the other hand, Chan [27] stated that the PDLC film should be designed with the bipolar droplet axis of symmetry oriented within the film plane or normal to the external field direction to n1aximize film contrast between the on and off states. Chan [27] shnulated the behavior of elongated bipolar nematic droplet in an external field, where the field was aligned parallel, and perpendicular to the droplet axis of symmetry. Numerical

13

results from the solution of Leslie-Ericksen continuum theory described the magnetically induced nematic director reorientation dynamics inside elliptical droplet with strong surface anchoring. He proposed that: For the case where magnetic field was applied along the droplet axis of symmetry [10]: a) The light that passes through the filn1 increase exponentially by increasing the exten1al
field~

but it saturates with field strength.

b) The light that passes through the film increase exponentially by increasing the external field, but it saturates with the time in on-state. c) The light that passes through the film increases exponentially by increasing the external field, but it saturates with the time in off state. d) By increasing the aspect ratio of droplet, switching field strength increases. e) By increasing the aspect ratio of droplet, the decay time decreases. With the external field applied perpendicular to the droplet axis of symmetry [27]: a) The light that passes through the film increase exponentially by increasing the external field, but it saturates with field strength. b) The light that passes through the filn1 decreases exponentially by increasing the external field, but it saturates with the time in on-state. In another simulation Chan et al. [ 11] elicited the effect of elongated nematic bipolar droplet orientation on the performance of polymer dispersed liquid crystal films. The performance
14

criteria were low switching film strength in the on state, good light contrast between the on and off states, and short relaxation time in the off state. The nume1ical results from solution of Leslie-Eriksen continuum theory and Frank liquid crystal theories explain the behavior of a PDLC film in an external magnetic field. The aspect ratio was fixed for 1.5 and the external field orientation varied fron10 to 90 degrees, while bipolar droplet axis of symmetry re1nained fixed. Rudhardt et al. [9] have visualized the response and relaxation dynamics of bipolar nematic liquid crystal droplet to an external electric field. With strong planner anchoring, upon application of electric field the surface starts to reorient, followed by reorientation of rest of droplet. They stated that there is no critical electric field strength. After removing electric field, elastic forces restored droplet to its original state. They used a typical film of 39 pm, which contains single layer of hexagonally shaped droplet of thickness 7 Jim, enclosed by PVA walls on an 18 J1m hexagonal close packed lattice. In their experiments they focused on behavior of a single droplet and their results verified the simulation reported by Chan et al. [ 11], who has already stated there is no critical electric field strength to start reorienting the director. There have been a vast number of researches on effects of different boundary conditions on the performance of LCDs. In theory, liquid crystal droplet is under different boundary conditions such as the following conditions proposed by Mirantsev and Romano [28]: a) Radial, where the molecules at the surface are oriented normal to the surface of droplet and point toward the center of droplet; b) Bipolar, with the molecules at the surface of droplet oriented tangential to the sphere and directed toward the poles. Radial and bipolar boundary conditions are shown in Figure 7.
15

There are several other boundary conditions investigated for droplet, for example Prishchepa et al. [29] have studied inhomogeneous boundary conditions for nematic droplet with one hemisphere under bipolar boundary conditions and one hetnisphere on the radial boundary conditions.

Another critical area of development for PDLC films is reducing the operating voltage for these devices. In these devices, high switching voltage means expensive electronic dlivers and reduced operating lifetime for displays. For this reason there is extensive experin1ental interest in reducing the operating voltage of these devices to lOV or lower. While Hirai et al. [30] reported of reducing the operating voltage for PDLCs to 6V. There were reports on operating voltage of window prototypes well-over 1OOV. Drzaic [31] claimed this difference in the operating voltage is because of different film thicknesses ranging from less than 10 microns to 25 microns or more. Since these are field-effect devices, thicker filn1s require higher voltages.

16

Doane [8] and Drzaic [3] recognized other criteria for example the droplet size which affects the operating voltage of PDLCs to be the droplet size. They claim that snmller droplet require higher reorientation fields than larger droplet, due to increased curvature of the nematic within small cavities. Also the small-droplet films with higher reorientation voltages often switched faster than lower-voltage films.

Drzaic [3] showed that the nematic droplet size is an important factor in the electro-optic properties of PDLC films, and Drzaic and Muller [4] reported that the droplet shape is equally important to determine the electro-optics of the filn1. For films using polyvinyl alcohol as the polymeric median the elastic-deformation free energy is n1inimized when the director field in the droplet is aligned along a tnajor axis of the spheroid; the electric field performs work on the nematic in reorienting the nematic into a higher-energy state. They also estimated the elastic and electric field free-energy-density changes that occur upon reorientation of the nematic droplet.

Recently there have been some experimental studies on the effect of aspect ratio of a nematic bipolar droplet on performance of PDLC films [32]. Wu et al. [32] have studied the response time, the time required for a droplet to reorient completely when the external field is turned on, the decay time, the time required for a droplet to go back to its initial condition after the external field is turned off, and operating voltages of light shutters formed from PDLC' s. the bipolar nen1atic droplet were used with different aspect ratios (1.19 and 1.625). They concluded that in PDLC films with nematic bipolar droplet, aspect ratio is an in1portant factor in the performance of the light shutter.

3. Methodology
This section consists of three parts. First simulation n1ethods are described, in part two criteria for system analysis is explained, and in part three opthnization method with genetic algorithm is explained.

3.1. Simulation methods
A brief description of mathen1atical model is given in section 3.1.1; numerical methods are explained, and algorithm for solving the partial differential equation with finite element method (FEM) and finite difference method (FDM) is presented in section 3.1.2.

Elliptical model is used to simulate the droplet. The formula is driven from Leslie_ Erickson theory [33]. According to this theory the director reorientation is governed by the following torque balance equation written in Cartesian tensorial notation:

(1)

where three terms on the left hand side denote the elastic torque, viscous torque and magnetic torque on the director per unit volume, respectively. Their constitutive equations for each are as follows:

18

re =

-nxЦ;

(2)

(3)

(4)

The term

v;:
ББ.

denotes the functional derivative of the distortion free energy density, f d , with

respect to the director n. The flow of nematics is very much like a flow in conventional organic liquid with molecules of similar size. There have been experimental observations to see if there is any macroscopic displacen1ent of molecules inside a nematic droplet (V > 0) when an external magnetic field is applied to the droplet [34] and result is negative. As a result, V = 0 in this work and the viscose term in Equation 1 is negligible.

(5)

A=

i [(VV)T + VV]

(6)

Xa is electric susceptibility anisotropy, y 1 is rotational viscosity, y 2 is irrotational viscosity, N is

angular velocity of director relative to that of fluid, A is rate of deformation tensor, n is director,
V is velocity field, and H is the magnetic field strength.

n is the detivative of director with

respect to time, and (VV)T is transpose of matrix VV. In an ideal nematic single crystal, the molecules are (on average) aligned along one common direction
ll.

However, in n1ost practical circumstances, this ideal conformation will not be

19

compatible with the constraints that are in1posed by the external. field acting on the molecules. There will be some deforn1ation of the alignment; the deformation may be described by a continuum theory. Equation 7 is the fundamental formula of the continuum theory for nematics and explains the distortion energy inside a droplet. The total free energy is expressed as follows:

F = fv fd dv + fv fm dv + fs Is ds

(7)

(8)

(9)

fm= --xa(n.H) 2

(10)

The three tern1s from left to right in Equation 7 are distortion, magnetic and surface free energy densities, respectively. The constantsk* 11 , k* 22 , k* 33 are respectively associated with the three basic types of deformation; splay, twist, and bend. It is possible to generate deformation which is pure splay, pure twist, or pure bend. Thus each constant must be positive; dhnensions of fd is an energy (per cn1 3 of nematic material). б;and бo are the actual and preferred orientation angles at the droplet surface. W0 is the surface anchoring constant. De Genes [33] stated that in most practical conditions the surface forces are strong enough to hnpose a well-defined direction to the director n at the surface; this is called 'strong anchoring'. In this case instead of minimizing the sum of bulk and surface energies, it is sufficient to minimize only the bulk terms, with fixed boundary conditions for n ..
20

It is assumed that magnetic field is applied with angle 0 to the droplet axis of syn1metry (z axis)

in order to minimize the external field required for reorientation of molecules [ 10]:

H = (H ,0,0)
And the tangential planar two dimensional director field is defined as below:
n (r~ z, t) = [sin(<P(r, z, t), 0, cos( 4> ( r, z, t)]

(11)

(12)

The following scaling relations are used to non-dimensionalize Equation 1. So, from now on, elastic constant ratios are replaced with their dimensionless values.

The din1ensionless Zocher number, Z0 , gives the relative n1agnitude of magnetic to elastic torques. The dimensionless time, t, is in order of milliseconds [ 10].

The equation that explains behavior of orientation angle is detived by solving equations 1-16. The following nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) describes the magnetically induced director reorientation dynan1ics [ 10]:

Numerical methods
In section

In this part algorithm of solving Equation 17 with FEM and FDM is described.

3.1.2.1, algorithm for solving Equation 17 with FDM is explained. FEM algorithm is described in 3.1.2.2.

It is important to talk about the mesh used for simulation in each section. In the beginning the previous simulations is reproduced with similar n1esh used in literature [ 10]. Second, it is desired to compare the numerical values of orientation angle in each node, in simulation with FDM and FEM to verify applicability of two methods. As a result similar mesh is used in two simulations. Because of FDM sensitivity to mesh near the boundary, it is necessary to have finer spacing in that area and in comparison section an unequal spaced mesh is fine near the boundary with wider spacing in the center of circle. The mesh in literature is equal spaced and it is not fine near the boundary. As a result the following mesh (Figure 8) is used in comparison of two methods. This mesh is unequal spaced. Figure 9 shows the 1nesh in bipolar configuration and initial condition in the bipolar nematic droplet. Definition for a and b (lengths of the ellipse) is shown in Figure 9. Otientation angle,б, is defined, and {} is the angle of magnetic field with respect to the z axis which is zero in this simulation. Result of mesh refinement with sensitivity of 0.001 indicates that 221 elements is optimum elements for simulation of a single droplet. In system analysis and optimization section, 221 elements is used for simulation of a single droplet.

Finite difference method (FDM) is one of numerical methods for solving differential equations. In this method the derivatives which appear in the differential equation are replaced by their finite difference approximation [35]. The derivatives can be estimated by two, three, or more number of points. The more number of points used for approximation of derivative, the more improved accuracy of approxin1ation is obtained. There are diferent methods for approximating the derivatives in PDE [35]. Here the second order lagrange interpolating polynomial is

employed to define Equation17 in finite difference form (Appendix A). The reason for choosing

26

Lagrange interpolating polynomial 1s because of its high accuracy in interpolating unequal spaced mesh.

3.,L2.2 Galerkin Finite Element Method [37]
The Galerkin method is a method used for converting a differential equation to a problem of linear algebra or a high dimensional linear system of equations, which may then be projected to a lower dimensional syste1n. These small systems are easier to solve than the original problem, but their solution is only an approximation of the original solution. Finite element method divides the domain into simply shaped reg1ons or elements. An approximation for the PDE can be developed for each of these elements. The total solution is then generated by linking together or assembling the individual solutions ensuring the continuity at the interelen1ent boundaries. Thus the PDE is satisfied in a piece wise fashion. It should be mentioned that Galerkin Finite element method is one of methods of weighted residuals. The same mesh and initial condition is used in simulation with FDM and FEM. For time integration fourth order Runge-Kutta method is used with time step of 104 . The criterion for the steady state condition is the time when the change in <iб1> is less than 1o-5 и Algorithm for solving the PDE with FDM and FEM is shown in Figure 10.

The steps shown in Figure 10 are taken and behavior of <1б1> over time is studied. Equation 17 is solved in two dimensions (the mesh is shown in Figure 8). The result of discretizing Equation 17 and derivation of jacobian and residual vectors is presented:

3.2 System analysis
In this section, response time (trsp) and relaxation time (trlx) are defined. Response time is the time required for bipolar droplet to reorient from initial average orientation angle,
<1~1>,

upon

application of an external field, and reach the steady-state condition with magnetic field on,
<lf/Jst.onl>. One of the perfonnance criteria for a PDLC film is having minin1um response thne.

For a droplet to reach to steady state condition, .the balance of elastic, viscose, and magnetic torques in Equation 1 should be zero. When the field is turned on, walls (boundary) and magnetic field compete inside the droplet. Because walls play important role in explaining the response time, it is better to first take a look at the constant of anchoring strength, Wo, which defines how much the external field can reorient the walls. Figure 11 represents three values for Wo. It is observed that Wo= 103 is strong enough to make a bipolar configuration, and result in strong anchoring [24]. In this work, the value of W0 is 103 и So, walls are fixed and do not reorient with external field.

31

(a)

Figure ll.Steady-state director configuration according to the dimensionless surface anchoring strengths: 3 3 (a) W =10- , (b) W =1, and (c) W =10 [24].

When the field is removed, the orientation of the droplet director returns fro1n an angle of

<lб'sr.on1> to

<1~1>.

The relaxation time is achieved when the balance of elastic and vtscous

torques in Equation 1 becomes zero. After the orientation of director reaches <I бst.on1 > field is turned off and the relaxation time is measured. The three independent variables in a liquid crystal droplet are aspect ratio (c), elastic constant ratio (k33/ k11 ), and magnetic field strength (Z0 ). The effect of these variables on the response and relaxation time is studied and presented in sections 4.2.1-4.2.5.

32

3.3 Optimization
The term opthnization refers to the study of problems in which one seeks to minimize or maximize a real function by systematically choosing the values of variables fron1 within an allowed set. This allowed set defines the constraints of the optin1ization problem. Here genetic algorithm is used to find optimum aspect ratio (c) of droplet, elastic constant ratio
(k3Jik,11 ) of molecules inside the droplet, and external field strength (Z0 ) subject to the constraints

of minimum energy used for reorientation of molecules, minimum time required for reorientation of director in on-state and minimum relaxation time for reorientation of the director in off state. Brief description of genetic algorithm is followed.

3.3.1 Optimization Algorithm
There exists number of optimization algorithms which are mainly divided in two parts of traditional and nontraditional optimization algorithms. There are many traditional methods designed for special optimization problems, such as single-variable optimization algorithms, multi-variable optimization algorithms or constrained optimization algorithms. These algotithms are being used in engineering design problems since sixties, and because of their existence and use for quite some years; they are called traditional optimization algorithms [38].

33

Nontraditional optimization methods are relatively new methods and are becoming popular in engineering design optimization problems in the recent past. Genetic Algorithms is one of these nontraditional methods.

The advantages of genetic algorithms on traditional methods are:

1) None of traditional optimization algorithms are guaranteed to find the global optilnum of

the objective function. Where genetic algorithm is found to be a better global searcher. 2) Sometimes there is more than one global optimun1 in an optimization problen1, and it is necessary to know all the optimum solutions. By using traditional methods we need to apply the method a number of times, and each tin1e start from a different initial solution. This way hopefully one will find a different optimal solution. Genetic algorithms find multiple solutions simultaneously in a single search. The basic mechanism of a GA is so robust that, within fairly wide margins, parameter settings are not critical. Among nontraditional optimization methods, GA is famous for being a robust global searcher.

3. 3. 2 Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms are computerized search and optimization algorithms, which are based on the mechanics of natural genetics and natural selection. Professor John Holland of university

34

of Michigan, Ann Arbor, envisaged the concept of these algorithms in the mid-sixties and published his work [38]. After that many of his students continued working on GAs where the results are published in many papers and books, i.e. [39].

3o3o2.1 Principles of working with genetic algorithn1S

An optimization problem consists of objective function which we would like to minimize or n1aximize, fi( u) , subject to some constraints which are known frotn the natural conditions of problem.

Because genetic algorithms are based on selection of the fittest principle of nature to make a search process, the optimization problem should come in the form of maximization. So, the minimization objective function will be changed to a maxin1ization problem with a fitness function. The fitness function has the same optimum as the objective function but in the form of a maximum. A number of such transformations are possible but the most common fitness function is:

fitness (u) =

1+

j.(u )
l.

(37)

First step in solving an optimization problem with GAs is coding the variables. Binary-coded strings having l's and O's are mostly used. Each variable is coded with one string Si with

35

length li .The length of strings can be different from each other. For example if an optimization problen1 has two variables and are variables are coded with 5 bit strings, the lower and upper limits are presented by (00000 00000 ) and ( 11111 11111 ), because the substrings (00000) and ( 11111) have the minimu1n and maximun1 decoded values. Any other set of 5 bit binary strings represents a point in the search space. The value of each point can be calculated with the following linear function:
m l

Ut

= uf

+ RAND_MAX-1 ui -ui . decoded value of Si

(38)

The decoded value of each string (Si) is calculated as:

(39)

Where string Si is represented as (Sz_J Sz-2 ... S2 S1 So). It is clear that by increasing the length li by one, the accuracy of answers increases exponentially. The length of each depends on the desired accuracy of the variable it stands for.

The operation of GAs starts with selecting a population of random strings, design variables. After that decoded value of each variable is calculated, and by using mapping function, the value of variable is found.

Thereafter, each variable is evaluated to find the fitness value. The population is operated by three main operators- reproduction, crossover, and mutation- to create a

36

population of points. Each tin1e a population is gone through these three operators is called a generation.

3~3 ..2.2

GA Operators

1) Reproduction is the first operator applied on a population. By calculating the fitness value

of each string, the good strings are selected and copied in the n1ating pool with a probability proportionate to their fitness value. Since the population size is usually kept fixed in SGA (sin1ple genetic algorithm), the sum of the probability of each string being selected for the mating pool must be one. Reproduction operator is sometimes called selecting operator, too. Its working principle is similar to a roulette-wheel with its circumference marked for each string proportionate to the string's fitness. So, a string with small fitness value has smaller probability to be copied in the mating pool.

2) Crossover operator is n1ostly the second operator applied on a population. In reproduction phase no new strings are formed. And only strings with high probability are copied in the mating pool.
In crossover phase, a coin is flipped with a probability Pc , for two random strings and if

the result of flipping the coin is positive, the two strings crossover each other from the

37

right side of a random bit. For exatnple, when the first two strings from the top of the list in population are (001110001) and (100110101), and hnagine that result of flipping the coin was positive, then a randon1 number between 0 and 8 is chosen. Let's imagine that the random number was 4. Now the two strings crossover each other from the right side of the 4th bit, and the result would be: (001110101) and (100110001) It can be noticed that the result of crossover is fonning new strings. Although crossover is not guaranteed to make good strings but it is not a problen1, because if the result of crossover is bad the string does not survive long in the reproduction phase.

3) Mutation operator is also responsible to make new strings but it completes the crossover phase. Let's imagine a population as: 00111 01010 01011 00011 Suppose the optimum value has 1 in the left-most bit position. As we noted reproduction operator does not change the strings, so we can't be hopeful to get 1 in that position through reproduction. Besides, the probability of the left-most bit position being changed

38

in the crossover is much less than the right-most bit. But the mutation operator gives the left-n1ost bit some chance through the probability Pm of turning 0 into l. All these three operators work together to hopefully create better strings. Reproduction operator copies the strings with above average fitness values in the mating pool. Then crossover recombines two of the strings in the mating pool to create new substrings. The mutation operator changes a string locally to hopefully create a better string. Although, none of these steps are guaranteed to create good strings, but as bad strings will be eliminated by the reproduction operator in next generation and good strings will be emphasized. The algorithm for solving an optimization problem with SGA is followed:

и

Step 1 choose a coding to represent problem parameters, a selection operator, a crossover operator, and a mutation operator. Choose population size, crossover probability Pc and mutation probability Pm и Initialize a random population of strings of size li . Choose a maximum allowable generation number.

и

Step 2 evaluate each string in the population.

и

Step 3 if generation number> maximum allowable generation number,Terminate.

39

и

Step 4 perform reproduction on the population.

и

Step 5 perform crossover on random pairs of strings

и

Step 6 perform mutation on every string.

и

Step 7 evaluate strings in the new population. Set loop = loop+ 1 and go to step 3.

Results and Discussion

In section 4.1, results of simulations are presented. After verifying FDM simulation results
system analysis is carried out based on FDM simulation, and presented in 4.2. Multi-Objective optimization results with Genetic Algorithm are described in 4.3.

4.10 Simulation
The main interest of this part is to n1odel behavior of a single bipolar droplet, and study the dynamic behavior of this single droplet when an external field is applied parallel to its axis of symmetry. This section presents nun1erical results obtained from solving Equation 17 with two numerical methods of FDM and FEM. Simulation results repo1ted by Chan [10] using FEM is reproduced in section 4.1.1, and results obtained with FDM is presented in section 4. 1.2. In section 4.1.3 simulation results with FEM and FDM are compared.

The value for elastic constants (kn = 0.6667 and simulations by Chan [ 10] in this section.

The external field is turned on and behavior of <I б1 > is studied. The time required for the director to reach steady state condition when n1agnetic field is on, <lбst.on1>, is measured and then the external field is turned offи and the relaxation time, the time required for a droplet to reach steady state condition in off state, is n1easured, too.

Orientation of molecules in their initial condition and after application of an external field (Zo =2000 to be consistent with previous simulation [ 10]) to the droplet is shown in Figure 12. This figure shows the change in director orientation inside a droplet before 12 (a), and after 12(b) external field is applied to it. Upon application of external

4. 1. 2 Sintulation with Finite Difference method
In this section, result of shnulation of a bipolar droplet with FDM is presented. Steps described in section 3.1.2.1 were taken. Figure 13 shows the initial condition (a), and steady state condition, (b) when external field is turned on. In the beginning, (a), the droplet is in its bipolar configuration. Upon application of magnetic field the molecules align with the external field. Z0 , c, kn, and k33 have the same value as in Figure 12. It is observed that in both cases (Figure 12 and Figure 13) after applying the external field, the molecules reorient and align with the field.

Besides, rnesh refinement is carried out to find the optimum number of elements necessary for the simulation. The criterion is when the change in steady state mean magnitude of orientation angle
<l~t.onl>

is less than 0.001 during the time when external field is on. Results of mesh

refinement indicate optimum nun1ber of elen1ent to be 221. In syste1n analysis and optin1ization section 221 elements is used for simulation of a single droplet

4. 1. 3 Comparison of FDM and FEM simulation results
The results of FDM simulation are compared with FEM results to verify the applicability of two methods. In order to do so, numerical values of orientation angle in each gtid point should be cotnpared with FEM nun1erical results. In section 4.1.3, FEM is run with FDM mesh and mean magnitude of orientation angle is compared in each time step.

All variables have the same value (c

= 1. Zo = 2000, k1Yk11 = 2). Mesh presented in Figure 9 is

used as initial condition. Figure 14 shows the steady state condition with external field applied parallel to the droplet axis of symmetry. The left half of circle represents the FEM results and the right half represents the FDM results. It is observed that in both simulations the molecules are reoriented and aligned with the n1agnetic field, the results of reorientation are identical in two half circles.

The behavior of <I (/A> over time is compared in FDM and FEM. Behavior of <I~> over time in FDM is presented in Figure 15, and behavior of <1б1> over time in FEM is presented in Figure 16. The mean magnitude of orientation angle is defined according to Equation 31.

In Figures 15 and 16 the field is on during dimensionless time 0-0.1, and after that external field

is turned off and director goes back to its initial condition. The behavior of <I б1> over time is identical in two figures. It can be seen in Figure 15 that response time, the time required director to reach the steady state condition with tnagnetic field > 0 is smaller than time, time required for director to reach steady state condition when external field is turned Response time and relaxation time are further studied in section 4.2.

The CPU tin1e for simulation of a single nen1atic droplet with specific aspect ratio (c = 1), elastic constant ratio (k3Yf<, 11 =2.0), and external field strength (Z0 =2000) was measured for a 2 GHz laptop. FDM gives the answer in 5 seconds where FEM gives results in 30 seconds. System analysis and optimization are based on FDM program, because it is six times faster n1ethod in comparison to FEM in sin1ulation of a nematic droplet. Since there is no analytical solution present for modeling the behavior of a single droplet in a magnetic field, the accuracy of the results with two methods cannot be compared adequately. However, mean magnitude of olientation angle is similar in both simulations and follow the same pattern.

4.2. System analysis
The effect of physical properties, shape of droplet, and external field strength is studied performance of PDLC films in section 4.2.1- 4.2.5. The performance criteria are response and relaxation time.

4. 2.1. Effect of aspect ratio on response time and relaxation time
Aspect ratio is changed from 1 to 2, as droplet goes from spherical to an elongated shape. effect of this change on response time and relaxation time is studied. Figure 17 shows the change in response time with aspect ratio for spherical droplet (c = 1.) Z0 3000 and k3;/k11 = 2. It is observed that response time increases by the aspect ratio of the droplet. Drzaic [3] has observed this phenon1ena and he explained that molecules in a spherical ~. . '"'~-" . .'""" , , , , ,

50

are more curved иthan molecules inside an elongated droplet. The response time is a function of distortion energy of molecules inside the droplet, and highly curved molecule have more distorted energy and responses to the external field faster than a less curved n1olecule. As a result response time increases by aspect ratio.

Figure 18 shows the effect of aspect ratio on relaxation time. It is observed that relaxation time decreases as the aspect ratio increases. Because the droplet with higher aspect ratio is distorted less than a spherical droplet when it reaches <lбston1>, as a result upon removal of external it reaches the initial condition faster than spherical droplet [10]. Besides, Figures 17 and 18 show that response time is one order of magnitude smaller than relaxation time and the rate of change in response time is about one hundred time smaller than rate of change in relaxation time.

4e2 . 2 Effect of external field strength on response time and relaxation tilne
Strong external field means high energy and an expensive device. Figure 19 represents the response thne versus magnetic field strength. This figure shows that response time decreases with external field strength because of increase in H which reduces t. Effect of magnetic field strength on relaxation time was also studied. Results show that relaxation time is not a function of field strength. In off state Fm =0.

4.2 . 3 Effect of elastic constant ratio on response timeиand relaxation time
In this work, effect of splay and bend elastic constant is studied on performance of PDLC films. As simulation is restricted to a nen1atic droplet in two dimensions there is no twist deformation presented.

In a nematic droplet k33/k11 is in range of 1-16 [33]. Above this range nematic droplet change to semactic with more positional order in molecules. Bipolar configuration is achieved for droplet with k331kn between 1.1 and 2.3 [36]. Effect of elastic constant ratio on response time is measured to be less than 1o-6 for Zo between 1000 and 3000. This change is very small because of strong external field strength which don1inates magnetic torque in Equation 1. But effect of elastic constant ratio is significant on relaxation time (Figure 20) .. As expected relaxation time increases with elastic constant ratio, because of more positional order inside the droplet with high elastic constant ratio, the molecules resist more to change in orientation than a n1olecule with less positional order.

4. 2. 4 Effect of aspect ratio and external field strength on sum of response and relaxation time
In this section, elastic constant ratio is fixed (k33 I k 11 = 2) and effect of the two other variables, aspect ratio of droplet and external field strength, on sum of response time and relaxation time is studied. The goal is to have minimum relaxation and response time. An objective function which is summation of relaxation time иand response thne is defined as:

_ J + J _ trsp-trsp(min) + JM1- 1 2 - trsp(max) -trsp(min)

trtx-trlx(min) trlx(max) -trb:(min)

The results of simulation are shown in Figure 21. The vertical axis represents the objective function. Each curve represents a specific Z0 , and the aspect ratio in each curve changes from 1 to 2, Zo has a major effect on reduction of response time (Figure 19) and as a result Objective Function value decreases by Z 0 и
In each curve elongated иdroplet (c = 2.) results in minimum objective function. The higher the

external field strength, the less is objective function value. However, higher external field strength results in more energy consumption. And one of the objectives of this work is finding the minimum field strength that reorients the molecules inside the droplet. Besides, in this figure it is not possible to study the effect of elastic constant ratio on objective function. Minimization of energy and effect of elastic constant ratio of molecules in droplet are studied in optimization section (4.3).

By fixing the value of Z 0 , it is possible to study the effect of elastic constant ratio and aspect ratio

on response time and relaxation time. In this section, elastic constant ratio is changed in range of 1.1 to 2.3 [36]. Aspect ratio of droplet is changed from 1 to 2. Effect of these two variables is studied on JMI (Equation 40). Zo = 3000. Figure 22 shows that elongated droplet are optimal for they result in minimum JMl value.

4.3 Optimization
Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm is employed to find the optimum aspect ratio of droplet, elastic constant ratio of tnolecules inside the droplet, and external filed strength applied to PDLC films. Results of optimization are presented in this section.

GA is one of the nontraditional optimization methods. It can handle complex optin1ization problems, and is famous for being a robust, global searcher. As a result GA is used in optimization part of this research work. First, optimization program is tested with number of testing functions for unconstrained optimization. The behavior of these test problems varies to cover most difficulties faced in the area of continuous global optimization. Result of optimization with three different test functions (Booth, Beale, and Easom functions) are presented in Appendix C. Sections 4.3.1-4.3.2 describe the result of optimization on PDLC films performance.

4. 3. 1. Optimization of PDLC films performance
The optimization problem consists of objective function, variables and their limits:

For solving this optimization problem the random nu1nber generator uses the time function to generate the seed number; as a result seed number is randomly generated. Effect of loop number and population size is studied on optin1ization results. Loop number is changed fro1n 50 to 1000, and population size is changed from 50 to 750. Effect of population size and loop number on optimization results are presented in Table 2 and 3.

It is observed that increasing the population size and loop number increases the accuracy in results. However, large population size and loops means longer computation time. In order to define the loop number and population size, the following error (Equation 42) is calculated. i presents the iteration number. Sensitivity analysis show that loop number of 200 and population size of 500 results in error less than 1o-3 и As a result these values are used for optimization.

The fitness function is calculated based on иFDM simulations. The criterion for optimum results is minimum fitness function value. In Table 5 the best results achieved in 20 times running the optimization program is presented. The optimum aspect ratio is achieved in range of c elastic constant ratio is

=2. best

=1.1. Because of the sharp increase in relaxation time by elastic

constant ratio (Figure 20) it is expected that small elastic constant ratio results in minimum objective function. Optimum value of external field strength is Z 0

=1660. This field strength is

large enough to reorient the molecules completely upon application of exten1al field, and at the same time minin1um energy is applied to reodent molecules inside the droplet (Equation 41 ). The simulation results show that the elongated droplet are optimal because of their smaller relaxation time (Figure 18). The response time for an elongated droplet is more than sphedcal ones (Figure 17). However, response time is about one order of n1agnitude sn1aller than the relaxation time; as a result, the .elongated droplet are recommended to be applied in PDLC devices.

~ (1.1 - 1.2), and elongated droplet (c

2) provide an optimum perforn1ance for PDLC

films. High Zo ( z 3000) provides an optimum condition for PDLC films when the response time has large weight and energy efficiency has small weight. Relaxation time is not a function of Zo and as a result, weight of l2 does not affect the optimum Z0 и It is expected that in cases where ] 1 (response time) has highest weights in comparison to ] 2 (relaxation time), the optimum aspect ratio be achieved at spherical droplet, (c
z

1). However,

Table 6 shows that in ranges where weight of ] 1 is eight times bigger than weights of l2, elongated droplet (c ::::: 2) provide an optimum condition. The reason is that change in response

time is 10-2 of change in relaxation time, and elongated droplet provides lllinimum J M2 in this range of weights. By further studying effect of weight ratios of ] 1 and 12 in Table 7, it is observed that sphelical droplet (c ::::: 1) result in an optimum performance when the weight response time is about 100 times bigger than weight of relaxation time.

Table 8 shows that in cases where response time and energy efficiency (]1 and ] 3 ) compete with same weights, optimum Z 0 is achieved in range of 1600, and because effect of relaxation time is zero, opthnum aspect ratio is around 1. All optimization results show that elastic constant ratio of bipolar droplet should be around 1.

Conclusions

FDM is found to be a faster n1ethod in simulation of this droplet than FEM in simulation of a single nematic bipolar droplet. FDM was employed to model the behavior of a single nematic bipolar droplet when an external field is applied parallel to the droplet's axis of symmetry. Results of modeling with FEM and FDM were compared and the results are identical. System analysis was carried out and effect of shape, physical properties, and external field strength was elicited on performance of PDLC films. Performance criteria for PDLC films are short relaxation time, response time, and sn1all external field strength. Simulation results show that:
1) Response time is estimated to be one order of magnitude smaller than relaxation time.

2) Liquid crystals with small elastic constant ratio would have smaller relaxation time. Effect of elastic constant ratio on the response tilne is insignificant. Multi-objective optimization with genetic algorithtn was first tested on several challenging optimization problems, and then it was employed to find optimum aspect ratio, elastic constant ratio, and Zo in PDLC films. Numerical results show that: 3) Elongated droplet (c := 2) would result in minimum response time in on state, and relaxation time in off state. Spherical droplet would provide an optimum condition when n1inimization of relaxation time is not interested.

4) Droplet with sn1all elastic constant ratio (k33
k11

::

1.1) would provide minimun1 response

time in on state, and relaxation time in off state.

5) The external field with Z0

1600-1800 is estimated to be optimum field strength when

minin1ization of response time and tninimization of energy have similar weights. In cases where one is more interested in minimization of response time, high Zo ( provide an optimum condition.

6. Recommendation
In this research work, a bipolar nematic droplet was modeled in two dimensions and effect of bend and splay elastic constants on performance of PDLC films was studied. Recently there is interest in use of chiral nematic droplet in PDLC films [8]. By modeling a chiral nematic droplet in three dimensions, the optimum elastic constants and aspect ratio of the
droplet~

and external

field strength can be defined for the PDLC films. Three dimensional modeling would enable one to study the effect of twist deformation.

Effect of loop number and population size is studied on optimization results. Loop number is changed from 100 to 2000, where the population size is fixed on 1000. Results are presented in Fig. C.3. It is observed that by increasing loop number, accuracy of results increase sharply and it saturates with loop number in the range of 600 loops. It is concluded that GA solves the booth optimization problem with accuracy of 1o-4 in about 600 loops, and 1000 population size. The tin1e for one run of program with the parameters presented in table 4 is 15 seconds.

Another test function for unconstrained optimization is Beale function and is expressed as:

(C.2)

Variables; x 1 , Xz This is a popular test function for global optimum searcher algorithms. Specifications of Beale function are presented in Table C.3.

Loop number and population size are defined according to the accuracy needed for results of optimization, considering time consumption for each run of optimization. By increasing loop number accuracy of results increases but for increasing the loop number by 1000, the run time for one run optimization with population size of 2000 increases 20 by seconds. Optimization with GA paran1eters presented in table 6 results in percent of standard deviation 10%.

Appendix C* 3* Optimization of Easom function
Another challenging optimization problem is defining global minin1um of Easom function. This is a two variable function with several local minimums. The graph for this function shows that the global minimu1n searcher needs to completely cover the don1ain to not be trapped in local minin1ums. The search domain for Easo1n function is one order of magnitude bigger than Beale and booth functions. It is important to test the GA in big search domains, because of the big search don1ain range for Zo for optimization of PDLC films; one should make sure that GA will be able to find the global optimutn of Easom function. Figure C.7 shows Easom function.
