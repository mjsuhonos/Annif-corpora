Information Wars and Online Activism During the 2013/ 2014 Crisis in Ukraine: Examining the Social Structures of Pro- and Anti-Maidan Groups
Anatoliy Gruzd and Ksenia Tsyganova
This article examines how online groups are formed and sustained during crisis periods, especially when political polarization in society is at its highest level. We focus on the use of Vkontakte (VK), a popular social networking site in Ukraine, to understand how it was used by Pro- and AntiMaidan groups during the 2013/2014 crisis in Ukraine. In particular, we ask whether and to what extent the ideology (or other factors) of a particular group shapes its network structure. We find some support that online social networks are likely to represent local and potentially preexisting social networks, likely due to the dominance of reciprocal (and often close) relationships on VK and opportunities for group members to meet face-to-face during offline protests. We also identify a number of group-level indicators, such as degree centralization, modularity index and average engagement level, that could help to classify groups based on their network properties. Community researchers can start applying these group-level indicators to online communities outside VK; they can also learn from this article how to identify networks of spam and marketing accounts.

Introduction The end of the Cold War in 1991 introduced a great change for people living in Ukraine, a former Soviet Union republic. However, Ukraine's transition to a modern and independent state has not been smooth. In 2004, the country experienced its first major political upheaval, popularly dubbed the "Orange Revolution." Cries of "Razom nas bahato! Nas ne podolaty!" ("Together, we are many! We cannot be defeated!") swept through Kyiv's Independence Square (Maidan). Thousands of Ukrainians raised their voices and stood up together to demand a political change in their country. In the fall of 2013, Ukrainians once again started gathering in Maidan, this time to protest the then Ukrainian government's decision to back away from an anticipated trade and association agreement with the European Union. They gathered at first in hundreds but the crowds quickly grew into the hundreds of thousands.

At first, the protests appeared to be similar to the 2004 Orange Revolution, with angry protesters forming makeshift barricades and riot police. But something was different about these protests. This time, the protesters and their supporters were equipped with more than just their ideals and homemade protest signs; many in the crowd now carried smartphones and other Internet-enabled devices in their pockets. They were ready to provide live updates, shoot pictures and videos at a moment's notice, and instantly share them on social media with supporters across the country and beyond. The ability to leverage social media identifies a striking difference between the 2013/2014 Ukraine Crisis and the Orange Revolution of 2004. During the Orange Revolution only about 12 percent of Ukrainians used the Internet (Dyczok, 2006).1 Social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram did not even exist, and Facebook was just about to be launched. In 2013, armed with these new information and communication technologies, Ukrainians across the country were able to follow the protests in Maidan in real-time. They could find out when and where to join the protest or even organize their own demonstrations by informing and connecting with likeminded individuals. What makes this case especially interesting to study is that groups in both camps (Pro-Maidan and Anti-Maidan)2 used social media websites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to catalyze various activities such as organizing protests, sharing real-time information about police and military movements, calling for donations and financial support, and sharing information with group members. Furthermore, it was not just members of these groups who had their eye on social media. Politicians and elected officials in Ukraine also used social media to share timely updates and political statements with the public. Law enforcement agencies monitored social media posts to anticipate where the next rally would occur. Ukrainian dissent and activist journalists used social media to shape the public's perception of Yanukovych's pro-Russian government and ensure accurate reporting of Pro-Maidan demonstrations in Kyiv (Szostek, 2014). Such unprecedented access to and use of different social media websites, by both proand anti-government supporters, was a game changer during the 2013/2014 Ukraine Crisis. In this article, we focus on the use of a popular social networking website in Ukraine called Vkontakte (VK). We are interested in uncovering differences and similarities in how the two opposing camps used the website to organize online groups in support of their cause. To do so, we study the underlying social structures of four of the largest VK groups (two Pro-Maidan and two AntiMaidan) by analyzing friendship networks among their members. Social networks have proven to be influential in engaging others in political action and deliberation (Biddix & Park, 2008; Gruzd & Roy, 2014), and they have revealed useful insights into the operation of online communities (Gruzd, 2014). For example, by studying underlying social network properties and typology, one can determine whether it is a successful online community or not (Gruzd & Haythornthwaite, 2013; Gruzd & Sedo, 2012), who are the influential members of a group (Aral & Walker, 2012; Gruzd & Wellman, 2014), how information spreads

among group members (Bakshy, Rosenn, Marlow, & Adamic, 2012; Grabowicz, Ramasco, Moro, Pujol, & Eguiluz, 2012), and whether there are any densely connected subgroups formed within a group, potentially representing different interests, affiliations, or geography (Ferrara, 2012; Gruzd, Black, Le, & Amos, 2012; Gruzd, Wellman, & Takhteyev, 2011; Takhteyev, Gruzd, & Wellman, 2012). The broad objective of this work is to establish baseline measures and observations that might help us and other community scholars to interpret emerging social structures of online activist groups. The study is an early work that attempts to achieve this broad objective by examining politically polarized groups from the two opposing camps. In particular, we ask if there are any observable structural differences or similarities in social networks formed by VK groups in the two opposing camps. If there are differences, we would like to know whether network properties alone might be able to suggest a group's political ideology or other characteristics. The results of this study can then be applied to analyze other politically motivated groups on VK and other social networking websites. The article is structured as follows: first, we review previous work in this area with a particular focus on studies that have relied on social network analysis (SNA) to examine and understand the use of social media for political and social engagement. We then discuss the data collection protocol and methods used in this study. Next, as a way to introduce the reader to the four VK groups in our study, we provide brief background information about each group. The subsequent section presents our analysis of the social network structures formed among group members, focusing on how to interpret different network properties and identify subgroups to reveal and explain the composition and user dynamics of groups. The article concludes with a comparative analysis of the four groups in question, and a discussion of the broader implications of this research. As this conflict is still ongoing at the time of writing, the article only focuses on the early part of the conflict from when the protests in Maidan Square escalated and turned deadly in early 2014, until the Ukrainian presidential election at the end of May 2014. Literature Review Social media have been described as a driving force behind many political and social movements around the globe. The #Occupy movements (Croeser & Highfield, 2014; Jensen & Bang, 2013; Thorson et al., 2013), the 2009/2010 protests in Iran (Burns & Eltham, 2009; Chatfield, Akbari, Mirzayi, & Scholl, 2012), and the revolutions and protests in the Middle East, the so-called "Arab Spring" (Aday, Farrell, Lynch, Sides, & Freelon, 2012; Eltantawy & Wiest, 2011; Khamis & Vaughn, 2011; Khondker, 2011; Tufekci & Wilson, 2012) are all events that involved social media use. Although Internet scholars are still debating the specific role(s) that social media played during these periods of unrest, many agree that social media platforms are effective information and communication

124

tools for organizing collective action and sharing up-to-date information among organizers, supporters, and the public at large. The recent crisis in Ukraine is the latest example of the importance of social media in contemporary collective action. One of the most popular social networking websites used during the crisis in Ukraine was VK (vk.com). Founded in 2006, the social networking website reports over 284 million registered users and over 100 million active users, primarily from the former Soviet Union republics, including Russia ($104 million registered accounts), Ukraine ($28 million), and Belarus ($5 million).3 Based on the user interface and functionalities, VK closely resembles Facebook, where a user can create a profile (public or private) and then start "friending" other users. VK users can exchange messages with one another privately or post/repost messages and share media content publicly. Users can also interact with content on the VK website through "liking" or leaving comments. Similarly to Facebook, VK users can organize a public or private group, or a community page. Because of the prominence of this website in Ukraine and its active use among Pro-Maidan and Anti-Maidan activists, we decided to use the website as a case study for our research. We focused our analysis on the four largest activist groups (two Pro-Maidan and two Anti-Maidan). We wanted to examine the network structures of these highly polarized groups, learn whether there are traceable differences or similarities in their underlying social network structures, and whether these differences or similarities could be explained by a group's political ideology or other factors. We purposely kept the research questions broad in order to explore any factors not previously found in the literature. To answer these broad and exploratory research questions and establish baseline metrics in this line of research, we relied on SNA. SNA has already proven to be a very useful method for studying different types of organizations that operate in physical, digital, or hybrid environments (Garton, Haythornthwaite, & Wellman, 2006). Some early work on online groups and their network structures suggests that social network properties and topology (the group's "footprint") often reflect a group's composition and/or goals. For example, Choi and Park (2015) found that groups on Twitter that are interested in sociopolitical discussions are characterized by a denser network structure, while groups that are built based on interpersonal interests tend to have a higher percentage of reciprocal connections among group members. Furthermore, Choi and Park (2015) found that groups that support information access have a more pronounced leadership structure unlike groups that support information sharing. Such insights help community scholars identify patterns in group formation, study how different groups organize themselves, and what types of networks different social media platforms support. For the purposes of this literature review, we conducted an extensive review of relevant publications and only discuss studies here that examined how different activist groups used social media, paying special attention to the types of network measures and procedures used to analyze group interaction and emerging connections. Since few studies have looked at the use of VK in the

political context, and even fewer have relied on SNA to examine group dynamics, we turned to the literature on the use of the world's two largest social networking websites--Twitter and Facebook.4 Due to Twitter's accessibility, it is one of the most popular social media platforms used for various protests. As a result, there is a large volume of literature that specifically examines the use of Twitter to support collective action. Morales, Losada, and Benito (2012), for example, examined the 2010 #SOSInternetVE Twitter protest that was organized to support freedom of information on the Internet in Venezuela. They found that highly connected Twitter accounts in this network significantly reduced the distance between group members and increased the speed of information flow. The study also reported the formation of different communities of tightly connected nodes. The largest cluster formed around opposition media and journalists, suggesting that more traditional forms of media are still influencing information flow on Twitter. n, Borge-Holthoefer, Rivero, and Moreno (2011) study on the Gonz alez-Bailo use of Twitter in the context of the 15-M movement in Spain in 2011 is also highly relevant to our work. The researchers analyzed mobilization processes over time and identified two main types of users engaged in political discussions on Twitter: early participants (who are likely to be activists leading the protests) and those who joined the conversation at a later date after about half of their Twitter connections had already joined it. What is especially interesting is that there was no typical topological position for early participants (activists), unlike those who were successful in spreading information in this network and who tended to hold more central positions in the network. Another study by Theocharis (2013), that investigated the use of Twitter to support a protest, examined how Twitter was used during the 2010 universities protests against the U.K. government's education cuts and increased tuition fees policy. The study found that despite the presence of highly connected accounts in the network, the network structure was decentralized and supported effective information sharing (with or without help from influential accounts). This is possibly because this protest had a strong offline component, in the form of a series of demonstrations happening in London, which probably created opportunities for protesters to meet face to face and form stronger bonds. In the final Twitter example, Khonsari, Nayeri, Fathalian, and Fathalian (2010) examined Twitter use by opposition groups during the 2009 Iranian presidential elections. As in the previous example, the authors found a decentralized network that still included a number of highly connected nodes. However, unlike the previous case, the Iranian network was more fragmented and consisted of two main connected clusters. The largest cluster (70 percent of nodes) included primarily people who opposed the government and another (24 percent of nodes) consisted of government supporters. To further inform our work, we also reviewed studies that examined the use of Facebook for collective action. These are highly applicable studies because of the similarity in structure between Facebook and VK. The similarity is seen in the reciprocal types of connections (if you are my friend, I am yours) and similar

126

functionalities (e.g., forming a group, leaving comments on a friend's page, etc.). In an experiment conducted by Kwon, Stefanone, and Barnett (2014), the researchers found that one of the strongest factors determining whether a person joined an activist group was the percentage of their friends who had already joined it (the so-called personal network exposure rate). This suggests that networks of activist groups on Facebook would likely represent densely connected nodes consisting of members who had likely known each other before joining the group. However, joining a group because you know an existing group member does not necessarily mean that you, or your friends, completely agree with other group members. This is especially evident in a study by Mascaro and Goggins (2011), where they examined discussion networks formed among members of a U.S.-based political group on Facebook called "Join the Coffee Party Movement." Using SNA, the researchers observed both advocacy and dissenting behavior in this group. Both proponents and opponents of the group appeared to be prominent in the network structure; however, according to the authors, the network around opponents was less centralized. Thus far, we note that across the different studies discussed above, the following two network properties emerged as characteristic of activist networks formed on social media: (1) the formation of different communities of tightly connected nodes that often separate opponents and proponents into two clusters, and (2) the presence of highly connected nodes that are important for fast information dissemination. Additionally, Conover et al. (2013) and Hemsley and Eckert (2014) found the presence of location-based association patterns among online discussants of the Occupy Wall Street movement on Twitter (a large geographically distributed movement in the United States and other counties that heavily relied on social media).5 Similarly to the Occupy movement, the Maidan and Anti-Maidan protests were not limited to a single location and consisted of many protests in different locations across Ukraine and other countries such as Russia. Because of this similarity between the two cases, we also decided to explore the relationship between the self-reported locations of VK users from Ukraine and Russia6 and the network structures of the VK groups in question. In sum, although there have been a number of studies of online activist groups, we are just starting to understand network structures and group dynamics among politically driven groups on social media. Most of the previous work on online activism has also primarily focused on communication networks such as those formed on Twitter and on Facebook discussion forums; friendship networks formed on social networking websites such as Facebook and VK have been largely understudied in the context of activist groups (with a few exceptions such as Kwon et al., 2014). This is important to note because the insights from the previous studies on communication networks may not be directly applicable to online groups that are based on friendship networks; thus, emphasizing the need for this line of research. This is because of the differences in the types of connections formed on communication networks, such as Twitter, and those formed on social networking websites such VK. For example, in communication networks, even opponents may appear to be connected because they are

127

exchanging angry messages with one another, while in a friendship network, they are unlikely to be connected. Another major difference is that in communication networks connections are directional, showing who is talking to whom; however, in a friendship network, connections are symmetric since a friendship relation is considered bi-directional by social networking websites (if you are my friend, I am yours). For a more detailed comparison between communication and online social networks, see Lancichinetti, Kivel a, Saram aki, and Fortunato (2010) and Bohn, Buchta, Hornik, and Mair (2014). Method For this study, we used VK's Web search interface to identify relevant groups from the two opposing camps. Only publicly accessible groups--ones that do not require users to log in or join the group--were considered for the study. We then selected two of the most popular (as reflected by total number of members) ProMaidan and pro-Western groups on VK (henceforth referred to as PRO1 and PRO2) and the two most popular Anti-Maidan and pro-Russian groups (henceforth referred to as ANTI1 and ANTI2). To identify Pro- and Anti-Maidan groups, we searched for any groups that included the word "Maidan" or "AntiMaidan" in their name (in Russian and Ukrainian, both spelled the same) or groups that they linked to. Once we selected two groups from each camp, we collected all publicly available data about each group and their respective members using a client application developed specifically for this study. This application relied on VK's public Application Program Interface (API) which offered several methods to access different data points about VK's public groups and their members, including:     Communities--to get information about groups and group members; Wall--to get post and comments from a community wall; Friends--to get information about group members' friendship relations; Likes--to get information about "likes" and comments that members and visitors leave on posts.

To ensure that we could establish as complete a picture as possible, we used all four API methods to gather publicly available information about the groups and their members.7 Due to the VK API's three-requests-per-second limit as well as limits on the total number of requests an application can make to each of the four available API methods, the data set was collected over a two-week period between May 25, 2014 and June 11, 2014. The retrieved data were stored as a set of GraphML files which contained information about the self-declared friendship ties among group members. For users with public profiles, GraphML also included some basic user information such as their self-declared location, gender, and date of birth. Table 1 shows some descriptive network statistics for each group in our sample. The network measures recorded in this table will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.

The collected data were analyzed using a mixed method approach. For the quantitative side, we used Exponential Random Graph Modeling (ERGM) with the network data to formally test geography-based association tendencies (see Appendix A); and applied the Walktrap community detection algorithm to identify and describe highly connected subgroups of users in the networks. Each of these techniques is discussed in more detail below in the context of their corresponding section. For the qualitative analysis, we used network visualization techniques to visually explore network structures and identify points of interest for further analysis. To visualize the networks we used a layout called Large Graph Layout (LGL). LGL is a force-directed layout designed specifically to display large size networks (Adai, Date, Wieland, & Marcotte, 2004). We also manually examined the pages for each of the groups and reviewed their general structure and content of discussion threads (if available), other group materials such as group rules, videos, and photos, and read the 100 most recent posts and corresponding comments (if available) to get a sense of how the group operated and what types of discussions and interactions were happening on their pages. Finally, we manually reviewed a sample of most connected public user profiles (basic user information, recent posts, and photos, if available) to help us interpret the different subgroups formed in the networks (see Appendix B for more details about the coding procedure and categories). A similar mixed method approach has proven to be very effective in some previous studies on online groups (e.g., Chau & Xu, 2007). Package R and its social network libraries statnet and igraph were used to manage, analyze, and visualize network data and perform ERGM. Tableau, popular software for advanced visual analytics, was used to build additional visualizations and analytics. Description of Groups PRO1 Group PRO1 was formed in early April 2014 to support Maidan and an anti-terrorist operation (ATO) conducted by the Ukrainian government against the separatist forces in Eastern Ukraine (Freedman, 2014). At the time of the data collection, the group consisted of 141,542 members and 338,344 connections among them. Since PRO1 was an open group, anyone could join it. However, moderators of the

Gruzd/Tsyganova: The Social Structures of Pro- and Anti-Maidan Groups

129

group could ban anyone from the group, temporarily or permanently, for a number of offenses specified in the group. Offenses included posting ads, spam, provocative messages, off-topic comments, as well as repetitive or old news. Moderators could also be banned if they abused their administrative privileges. The group prohibited the use of profanity, slang, and deliberate distortion of words. Trolling and abusive behavior toward other members were also prohibited. Despite these strict rules, or maybe because of them, the group was a place for very active discussions. As of May 25, 2014, there was a total of 6,317 posts, averaging 132 posts per day, attracting both supporters and proponents of Maidan and ATO. "Liking a post"8 was the most popular type of user engagement activity in this and the other three groups, followed by reposting (sharing posts with one's own VK friends) and then commenting on a post. On average, each post received about 190 likes (126 median). Although "liking" is the simplest form of group engagement, it is crucial for the involvement of less active group members and nonmembers. It also signals the group's interests and motivations to visitors. Additionally, "liking" can potentially help develop a sense of community by showing what posts and comments other group members find interesting and what ideas they support. In contrast to liking and reposting, commenting on a post requires more effort and is often done by more active members. For this reason it is not surprising that commenting was the least "popular" user interaction type among group members. PRO2 Group Formed in early January 2014, PRO2 consisted of 96,402 members with 221,452 connections among them at the time of data collection. This was the only group in the sample that explicitly stated its broad objective to "unite and coordinate the activities of civil society in Ukraine," "restart system of government," and "achieve European integration." Unlike PRO1, this group was more explicit about banning any Anti-Maidan messages. The group's rules also prohibited spam, racist, Nazi, anti-Semitic, communist, and anti-Ukrainian messages. Since January 2014, there have been 4,379 posts, averaging 35 posts per day. Based on a manual review of some recent posts, most of them were reposts of news stories from a Pro-Maidan-leaning online newspaper. Furthermore, only a few people were engaged in the discussion within the group forum. This suggests that the group might have been primarily used by others as a source of recent news regarding the Ukraine Crisis rather than as a platform for collective action. This use would seem to be out of sync with the group's main objective to "unite and coordinate the activities of civil society in Ukraine." ANTI1 Group The ANTI1 group supported Anti-Maidan activities in Donbas, an Eastern region of Ukraine. The group was initially used to organize Anti-Maidan protests

130

Policy & Internet, 7:2

in the Donbas area. However, after activists proclaimed the region to be the Donetsk People's Republic on April 7, 2014, the group became the place to recruit volunteers, military personnel and other professionals to support the cause of the Republic. The group was also a place to share recent news about the Republic and military actions by its militia. During the data collection period, there were 60,506 participants who shared 280,678 friendship ties with one another. Between February 25, 2014 and May 25, 2014 (the data collection period), there were 1,258 posts, averaging about 14 posts per day. ANTI2 Group Originally formed in 2011, ANTI2 focused on anti-American and pro-Russian discussions. However, since the events on Maidan in early 2014, the group shifted its focus to support Anti-Maidan activism, including the support of two selfproclaimed republics--Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republic. At the time of the data collection, the group contained 69,029 members and 192,273 friend connections among them. Between January 1, 2014 and May 25, 2014, the moderators posted 8,842 posts, averaging 39 posts per day. Based on a review of the most recent posts, the group primarily reposted news stories originally published on a pro-Russian news website. Similarly to PRO1 and PRO2, the commenting feature was disabled during the data collection period (on May 4, 2014). The discussion board was also disabled by the group administrator, likely due to an inability to moderate the discussion.9 Thus, at the time of writing (August 2014), the group primarily served as an information source. Nevertheless, the group attracted a very active membership who readily liked and reposted the original messages posted by the moderators. Results: Social Networks and Subgroups PRO1 Network To better understand the group's social structure, we visualized and analyzed the social network of group members in PRO1 (see Figure 1). The nodes in the network visualization represent VK users, and the connections represent selfreported friendship ties. The placement of nodes in the network visualization largely depends on the number of connections that the node has. More connected nodes tend to be displayed in the center of the network in order to minimize the number of overlapping lines connecting nodes, thus making it easy to see the underlying network structure. Due to the large network size, only the largest connected component (where all nodes are connected to at least one other node) is shown in the visualization. Isolated nodes and small, disconnected clusters are not shown.10 Based on a visual examination, the largest connected component of the network can be seen to comprise two interconnected clusters, a large one and a smaller one. The visualization of the clusters shows that people share closer

connections with members found within each cluster, than with people in the network as a whole. Each cluster is likely to represent people who share some interests and/or background, according to the well-documented phenomenon of homophily (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001). Based on the clusters visualized for PRO1, it appears that the largest cluster primarily consists of people from Ukraine (yellow nodes), and the smaller cluster contains a large concentration of people from Russia (red nodes). People from other countries (green nodes) appear to be spread evenly across both of the clusters. One possible explanation for this network configuration is that the smaller cluster, whose members are mostly from Russia, shares the group's Pro-Maidan views but might not necessarily have friends from Ukraine among PRO1 group members on VK. Because of this they are not directly connected to the main, larger cluster whose members mostly hail from Ukraine. Another possibility is that people in the smaller cluster are opposing the group's views. They may be joining the PRO1 group with the intent of monitoring its messages, posting misinformation, antagonizing other group members, or even trying to discredit the group and make it less attractive for others to join. The latter possibility is in line with some of the previous work discussed in the literature review section (e.g., Khonsari et al., 2010; Mascaro & Goggins, 2011). To confirm or reject these suppositions and identify the exact nature of users in each cluster, we performed the additional set of tests described below. First, using the "statnet" package in R (Goodreau, Handcock, Hunter, Butts, & Morris, 2008; Hunter, Handcock, Butts, Goodreau, & Morris, 2008), we performed ERGM to confirm the tendency of users to connect to other users from the same country, as observed in the network visualization in Figure 1a. Broadly speaking, the idea behind ERGM is to generate a large set of random networks based on a chosen set of node attributes and/or network properties from the observed network. To determine the quality of the resulting model, randomly

132

Policy & Internet, 7:2

generated networks are then compared to the observed network. This procedure allows us to judge whether the presence of connections in the network is influenced by certain node attributes more than by chance alone. For a more detailed description of ERGM, see Harris (2014). We started by building a baseline null model without any predictors (net $ edges), followed by a main effect model with one predictor based on the Friends attribute which indicates how many friends a user has on VK (net $ edges þ nodecov["Friends"]). At the final iteration, we added the Country attribute that stores information about the user's location (net $ edges þ nodecov["Friends"] þ nodematch["Country", diff ¼ T]).12 All predictors were statistically significant (p < 1 eÀ04), and the values of Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) statistics reduced with each iteration, indicating that the added predictors generally improved the model. We also performed a goodness of fit test to confirm that the resulting model is able to generate networks that are structurally similar to the observed network. The resulting model confirmed that PRO1 group members from Russia are likely to be friends with other group members from Russia (with an odds ratio of 3.59) and that PRO1 group members from Ukraine are likely to be friends with other group members from Ukraine (with an odds ratio of 2.25). Although ERGM helped us confirm the presence of the tendency of group members to connect based on their location, the exact nature of the network clustering remained unclear. Therefore, to continue our inquiry into the network structure, we ran a popular community detection algorithm called Walktrap, which is based on random graph walks (Pons & Latapy, 2005).13 The algorithm helped us isolate highly connected subgroups of nodes in the network so that we can examine them individually in more detail. The positive modularity index of 0.58 suggests good discriminatory power of the algorithm to detect different subgroups (Newman, 2006). Figure 1b visually shows the top-10 largest subgroups automatically determined by the Walktrap community detection algorithm. To help us explain the presence of different subgroups, we compared them based on the following three dimensions: the average number of likes (representing general engagement of the members within the subgroup), the average degree centrality (indicating the extent to which the subgroup includes highly connected accounts), and finally the number of users from Ukraine versus those from Russia. Figure 2 below visualizes these three dimensions across the 10 largest subgroups discovered by the community detection algorithm.14 This visual representation helps us easily identify differences and similarities among the subgroups. For example, subgroups 4 and 15 (blue and yellow nodes in Figure 1b, respectively) contain the greatest number of users, mostly from Ukraine, with a relative high level of centrality and user engagement. Due to the space limitations of this article, we will only examine two subgroups in more detail: subgroups 3 and 42 (green and red nodes in Figure 1b, respectively). Both subgroups have the smallest overlap with the other subgroups and may be perceived as holding an "outsider" position in the network. Based on

133

Figure 2. The PRO1 Top-10 Subgroups and Their Properties.

the three dimensions plotted in Figure 2, users in subgroup 3 have the highest average degree centrality, the lowest average number of likes, and more than half of them are from Russia. This suggests that these users are highly connected to one another, but not very active in the group. Generally speaking, these characteristics are consistent with the presence of fake or spam accounts. We confirmed this by manually reviewing the top-101 most connected user profiles in subgroup 3.15 Even though there were a few users with some politically motivated sentiments (either Pro- or Anti-Maidan), the majority (56 accounts) were in fact marketing, spam, inactive accounts or accounts blocked by VK due to suspicious activity (see Appendix B). The remaining accounts in Subgroup 3 appeared to be nonpolitically active accounts (n ¼ 29) that did not have any recent posts related to the crisis in Ukraine. In fact, most of them were used to repost messages with links to music albums, photos, or sport news from other VK pages. Only six accounts included some posts either in support of or in opposition to the events on Maidan. Seven accounts were hidden and three accounts were deleted at the time of this analysis. This suggests that subgroup 3 consists of accounts that mostly exist for marketing or promotional purposes and have little to do with the group's main goal. On the other hand, subgroup 42, that also appears to have few nodes in common with the rest of the network, included more active users as observed by a relatively high average number of likes. Our manual review of public user profiles based on a sample of the 108 most connected accounts16 revealed that this subgroup consisted of at least 44 accounts who identified themselves as being part of the Crimean Tatar community or their supporters, an ethnic minority in Ukraine17 that is largely supportive of Crimea staying part of Ukraine.18 This suggests that others in this subgroup might also have some connections to the

134

Policy & Internet, 7:2

Crimean Tatar community, as also supported by the fact that 44 percent (n ¼ 294) of users in this subgroup are located in the same Crimean city--Simferopol. In sum, although both subgroups (3 and 42) appear to hold a structurally similar position in the PRO1 network, the first does not consist of accounts that are related to the group's main goals, but the other one does. This suggests that SNA and visualization alone might not be able to fully explain a group's underlying social structure and that only by combining SNA with some additional information about a user's location and engagement level, are we able to get a fuller picture of the group and its composition. PRO2 Network Structurally, the PRO2 network exhibits similar characteristics to PRO1 (see Figure 3). Both networks have the same diameter (the longest path between any two nodes) and a similar clustering coefficient (see Table 1). Just as with PRO1, the PRO2 network comprises a large, densely connected main cluster (primarily of people from Ukraine) and a smaller cluster (looking like a "comet tail") with a relatively large concentration of users from Russia. The slight difference from the visualization of PRO1 is that the smaller cluster splits into two parts. Perhaps the split separates users from different geographical areas or users who share different interests. Following the procedure outlined above, we used ERGM to test geographybased homophily, which was confirmed by the resulting model. We found that PRO2 users from Russia are likely to be friends with other group members from Russia (with an odds ratio of 4.20) and that PRO1 group members from Ukraine are likely to be friends with other group members from Ukraine (with an odds ratio of 2.29). Both predictors are statistically significant (p < 1eÀ04). The model suggests that the tendency to form ties among group members from Russia is twice as likely as the same for users from Ukraine. Considering the pro-Ukrainian

135

and pro-Western focus of this group, it is not surprising that there is no strong tendency for ties between the two countries in this group. To explore this tendency further, similarly to the previous procedure, we applied the Walktrap community detection algorithm to isolate nodes that belong to the "comet tail" part of the network. This is where we observed a relative concentrated area of users from Russia. The resulting modularity index was relatively high (0.58) indicating that the Walktrap algorithm was able to identify well-defined subgroups (see Figure 3b). The two subgroups of interest here are marked as 8 and 96 (gray nodes). To better understand their composition, we compared the top-10 subgroups (based on the number of users) found by Walktrap over the following three dimensions: the average degree centrality, the average number of likes, and the number of users from Russia versus those from Ukraine (see Figure 4). Like the "marketing" subgroup in PRO1, subgroups 8 and 96 in this network also have one of the highest average degree centralities (indicating a high level of interconnectivity among the accounts within the subgroups) and one of the lowest average number of likes. Based on a manual review of sample accounts in these subgroups, the majority in subgroup 8 (77 out of 100 accounts) were clearly spam, inactive, blocked accounts or those set up to promote various types of information, products, or services. Subgroup 96 also included a large number of explicitly spam, marketing-type, inactive or blocked accounts (77 out of 102 in the sample).19 One of the possible reasons why we found subgroups in both PRO1 and PRO2 with a relatively high concentration of accounts from Russia that exhibit spam or marketing-type behavior could be because there are simply more VK users from Russia (over 100 million registered accounts) than from Ukraine ($28 million). However, the exact reason is unknown due to the lack of data on this matter.

ANTI1 Network Based on the network visualization of ANTI1 (Figure 5), we observed two clusters, similarly to PRO1 and PRO2: the larger cluster consists primarily of users from Ukraine, and the smaller cluster is a mixture of users from Russia and Ukraine. Unlike the PRO1 and PRO2 networks, the "Russian" cluster in ANTI1 is more pronounced and better integrated with the other cluster. This may indicate two types of users from Ukraine in this group: those without direct ties to Russia (in the larger cluster) and those who are closely related to people from Russia. To better understand the nature of these two clusters, we followed the same procedure outlined above; that is, ERGM, Walktrap community detection, comparison of properties across subgroups, and a manual review of sample user profiles. Similarly to the two previous cases, ERGM confirmed the presence of geography-based homophily, with an odds ratio of 1.89 for group members from Russia and an odds ratio of 1.98 for group members from Ukraine. Both predictors are statistically significant (p < 1eÀ04). The Walktrap community detection algorithm identified the two largest subgroups (1 and 6) that generally correspond to the two clusters in question. The modularity index is positive and equal to 0.42. Figure 6 shows that subgroup 6 consists of highly connected and engaged users. It includes slightly more users from Russia than from Ukraine (6,357 vs. 5,454). As expected, due to the proRussian focus of this group, the group attracted users from Russia who were engaged with the group content. A manual review of a sample of most connected public user profiles confirmed that subgroup 6 consists of politically motivated members who actively posted and reposted Anti-Maidan and pro-Russian related content on their own VK walls. Out of the top-100 most connected accounts, the majority (n ¼ 65) were politically active and none of the accounts in the sample included obvious spam or marketing posts. There were 33 hidden accounts in the

sample (likely personal accounts that are also politically active) and two deleted accounts. Subgroup 1 was the second largest. It consists of users predominately from Ukraine who were moderately central and engaged. However, the manual reviewing of a sample of the 103 most connected user accounts revealed a relatively high number of spam, marketing, inactive or blocked accounts (n ¼ 50).20 At the same time, there were 17 politically active users, 12 nonpolitically active users, 23 hidden accounts,21 and 1 deleted account. So although the subgroup is a good candidate to detect an interconnected network of spam and marketing-type accounts, it appears that it might also include a mix of nonspam accounts (both politically active and not). At this time, it is unclear what makes nodes in subgroup 1 densely connected, as identified by both the network layout and community detection algorithms. One likely explanation is that the clustering is due to the geographical location of VK users in that subgroup. ANTI1 primarily focuses on activities within one province in Ukraine (Donetskaya Oblast). Furthermore, 64 percent of users in this subgroup are located in one city (Donetsk). This suggests that people in the subgroup are geographically close to one another, which may explain why they are also likely to friend each other on VK. In sum, the ANTI1 network consists of two large subgroups: one represents the most active and politically motivated group members hailing from both Ukraine and Russia, and another subgroup represents a mix of marketing accounts, politically active and not politically active users--the majority of whom are located in Donetsk, the capital of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic.

ANTI2 Network The social network of ANTI2 is set apart from the four networks in the data set (see Figure 7). Instead of two pronounced clusters, as we observed in the other three networks, ANTI2 is primarily organized in one densely connected cluster, reflected in the network's high clustering coefficient of 0.13 (see Table 1). A high clustering coefficient may signify a stronger agreement among the group members. This is also supported by a relatively low modularity index of 0.24, calculated based on the Walktrap community detection algorithm. Notably, the largest two subgroups identified by Walktrap (11 and 24) are both very engaged and include highly connected groups of users (see Figure 8). Based on a manual

review of sample accounts in these subgroups, the majority were politically active or hidden accounts (see Appendix B). Although the ANTI2 analysis suggests tighter interconnections between people from Russia and Ukraine in this network; based on ERGM, the likelihood of being one's friend in this group still increases if two people are from the same country. The odds ratio is 1.6 for group members from Russia and 2.58 for group members from Ukraine (statistically significant, p < 1eÀ04). Conclusions In this article, we set out to examine the online social networks of two ProMaidan and two Anti-Maidan VK groups along the three main network properties that emerged from an initial literature review: (1) the formation of different subgroups of tightly connected nodes, (2) the role of highly connected nodes, and (3) the presence of geography-based homophily. Our main goal was to compare these groups structurally, considering their differences in the type of political ideology that they support. We found both similarities and differences in our analysis, grouped into the following broad themes. Geography Matters From the political ideological perspective, the most observable difference between the Pro- and Anti-Maidan groups was the number of users from Ukraine versus those from Russia. PRO1 and PRO2 contained proportionally fewer users from Russia (15 and 10 percent, respectively) than did ANTI1 and ANTI2 (30 and 50 percent, respectively). This is expected as PRO1 and PRO2 groups were proWestern/European Union, and ANTI1 and ANTI2 were pro-Russian. Further reinforcing this point is the fact that in the PRO1 and PRO2 networks, subgroups with a relative high percentage of users from Russia (PRO1 subgroup 3 and PRO2 subgroups 8 and 96, see Figures 2 and 4) tended to include spam, marketing, inactive or blocked accounts, suggesting that accounts from Russia that were part of the Pro-Maidan groups were not necessarily there because of their ideology but likely to promote products or services unrelated to the groups' main goals. In contrast, ANTI1 and ANTI2 had more users from Russia who tended to be more active (in terms of the average number of likes) and more central as measured by the average degree centrality (ANTI1 subgroup 6 and ANTI2 subgroups 11 and 24, see Figures 6 and 8). However, although all four groups included people from both Ukraine and Russia, the ERGM models confirmed the tendency of group members to friend others in the same country. Furthermore, we also observed homophily among users from the same city for the top-10 cities with the most number of VK users in all groups (see Appendix B). These results suggest that a user's location plays an important role in the formation of social connections in these groups. This is likely because VK networks are based on self-declared friendship ties among VK users, which may in turn replicate preexisting social structures of offline

140

Policy & Internet, 7:2

networks; thus increasing the chance of a VK connection between people who are geographically close to one another. ANTI2 was the only network for which adding the "City" node property lowered the quality of the ERGM model as indicated by the increased values of AIC and BIC statistics. This possibly reflects the fact that the group was less about locally driven collective action and more about information sharing with its group members. The exact mechanism behind the prominence of local ties in the four VK groups is still unclear, but one potential contributor is the fact that although the protests started in Kyiv--the capital of Ukraine--they quickly spread to other cities and towns across the country and thus were localized in nature. This might have encouraged people from the same municipalities who knew each other to join VK groups in support of their cause. An example of such ties is ANTI1 subgroup 1 which included 64 percent of users from the same city of Donetsk, a hot spot for Anti-Maidan protests and later the stronghold of the separatist movement in Ukraine's Eastern Donbas region. This supposition is in part supported by Kwon et al.'s finding (2014) that one of the strongest factors determining whether a person joins an online activist group is the percentage of their friends who have already joined it. It is also broadly aligned with Hampton and Wellman's earlier work on how information and communication technologies may support and enhance locally based social connections (Hampton, 2002; Hampton & Wellman, 2003). Position of Spam and Marketing Accounts Although the detection of spam and marketing accounts was not the initial goal of our research, we found that another observable difference between the Pro- and Anti-Maidan groups was the inclusion and position of spam and marketing accounts within the social networks. In the PRO1 and PRO2 groups, spam and marketing accounts appeared to be organized in a densely connected subgroup of accounts with high degree centrality values and low user engagement in terms of the number of posts that these accounts liked in the group (relatively to the accounts in other subgroups). This is a somewhat expected position for spam and marketing accounts to hold because they likely "friend" each other to increase their authority and influence, but "real" group members would be unlikely to friend such accounts, which may explain their isolation from other subgroups in the network. Interestingly, this pattern was not observed in the ANTI1 or ANTI2 groups. Although the ANTI1 network structure consisted of two subgroups, similarly to PRO1 and PRO2, the two subgroups in ANTI1 represented somewhat different dynamics. One ANTI1 subgroup included politically active users from Ukraine and Russia, and another consisted of a number of different types of accounts ranging from spam and marketing accounts to politically active and nonactive users. This suggests that spam and marketing accounts in the ANTI1 network were more interconnected with other nonmarketing accounts, unlike in PRO1 and PRO2 where they appeared to be more removed from the core of the

Gruzd/Tsyganova: The Social Structures of Pro- and Anti-Maidan Groups

141

network. In the ANTI2 group, we only observed a few spam and marketing accounts among the top 100 accounts present in the two largest subgroups (11 and 24), which included mostly politically active users from Russia and Ukraine. This might be because ANTI2 moderators were more proactive in reporting or blocking such accounts. The patterns observed in ANTI1 and ANTI2 are important characteristics of these groups, but require further investigation with additional longitudinal and qualitative data. In sum, the observed differences between the Pro- and Anti-Maidan groups, in terms of the network position of spam and marketing accounts (or lack of them), are more likely to be reflective of how each group was organized and moderated rather than to be an artifact of a group's political ideology. At the same time, the discovery of their presence in online activist networks highlights the need for social media researchers to include spam detection as part of their study design and data collection protocols, with the goal of potentially excluding them from further analysis in order to avoid reaching inaccurate results. Finally, our study showed that it is important to differentiate spam/ marketing accounts from group supporters who might also be located in smaller, somewhat isolated subgroups because of their minority status in the group, such as is the case with the subgroup in PRO1 with a large number of users associated with the community of Crimean Tatars. The fact that they are represented as a separate subgroup in PRO1 does not necessarily suggest that people in this subgroup disagree with the group's Pro-Maidan views; in fact the opposite was true. Pairwise Comparison of Groups Across the Political Divide The following section examines more nuanced differences and similarities between groups in the opposing camps by performing a pairwise comparison of groups that are most similar, based on the type of messages they shared and the level of interactivity available to their members. ANTI1 Versus PRO1 Functionally, both ANTI1 and PRO1 groups allowed discussions among their members; either by commenting on moderators' posts or by posting messages to discussion threads.22 However, what sets them apart from each other is that PRO1 was organized as a news sharing and discussion space for its members, and ANTI1 focused on supporting collective action, such as organizing protests or recruiting volunteers for the militia. It is potentially because of ANTI1's focus on supporting collective action that the group operated around a few highly connected accounts (either individual leaders or organizational accounts), which may be a sign of a highly coordinated group. This observation is supported by a relatively higher degree centralization of this network. Degree centralization is a global network measure that helps to identify whether "power" in the network is evenly distributed across all members (when degree centralization ¼ 0) or

142

Policy & Internet, 7:2

concentrated in the hands of a few (degree centralization approaching 1). In the extreme case, when one person is connected to everyone in the network, but his/ her friends do not know each other (a so-called "star" configuration), degree centralization is equal to 1. When comparing degree centralization values across the four networks, ANTI1 has the largest value (0.0815) which is respectively 17 and 11 times higher than in PRO1 and PRO2, and three times higher than in ANTI2. This may be indicative of a more pronounced leadership structure in this group. Furthermore, the ANTI1 network has the shortest network diameter (16 vs. 19 in PRO1 and PRO2, and 21 in ANTI2, see Table 1), signifying that on average information might spread faster in the social network among ANTI1 group members than in the other three networks. This finding is similar to the previous study by Morales et al. (2012) who found that highly connected online users significantly reduced the distance between group members and increased the speed of information flow during the 2010 #SOSInternetVE Twitter protest in Venezuela. ANTI2 Versus PRO2 ANTI2 and PRO2 are good candidates to compare with one another since both groups primarily play the role of an information source for their members. Both groups mainly feature reposts of news stories from a single online source (PRO2 features news from a pro-Ukrainian site, and ANTI2 from a pro-Russian site). Both groups also disabled the commenting feature for posts. Despite these similarities, the number of members in ANTI2 went up by 1.6 times within just a two-month period from June 2014 to August 2014, while the PRO2 membership remained largely unchanged for the same time period. A possible explanation regarding why ANTI2 has gained members while PRO2 has not is that ANTI2 was founded two years prior to the conflict in Ukraine in December 2011. Thus, it is likely that it had a longer period of time to attract and cement the core group of followers. This is especially evident from the network representation of this group as a single, densely connected cluster, which suggests closer relationships between its group members (see Figure 7). One possible way to differentiate between the two groups (ANTI2 and PRO2) is to look at their clustering coefficient; an SNA property that can be used to detect closely connected groups. ANTI2 has the highest value of this measure (0.13) among the four groups in the study, with clustering coefficients ranged from 0.08 to 0.09. Alternatively, one can examine a related measure of modularity index. ANTI2 has the lowest modularity index of 0.24, compared to the other networks in the study. In future work, we are interested in investigating whether by disabling the commenting and discussion features, the group attracted more group members by eliminating opportunities for "trolls" and other users to start conflicts. Although ANTI2 has a limited set of tools for deliberation and collective action, it may still be a good place for people to keep up with latest news and discover other relevant resources, organizations and people to follow.

Study Implications and Future Work The study helped us better understand how VK activist groups use social media during the 2014 conflict in Ukraine. As we have discussed, we found some support of the idea that online social networks were likely to represent local and potentially preexisting social networks due to the dominance of reciprocal (and often close) relationships on VK and opportunities for some group members to meet face to face during offline protests. Future work will need to confirm this result using a more qualitative approach (e.g., by interviewing some of the online participants involved in the VK groups). Furthermore, since the ERGM testing was based on the self-declared locations of group members, our own future work will explore additional methods to validate self-declared locations (e.g., by identifying and combining user's profile information with locations mentioned in user's posts). We also identified a number of group-level indicators, such as degree centralization, modularity index, and average engagement level, which could help to classify and describe groups based on their network properties and structures. Other community researchers can begin to examine and apply these group-level indicators to online communities outside VK. They can also learn from this work on how to identify networks of spam and marketing accounts. From the methodological perspective, we found that a combination of SNA, visualization and community detection algorithm, coupled with a manual content analysis of a sample of group messages and user profiles, is an effective approach to study the underlying social structures of online activist groups. But we also confirmed that SNA alone could not explain the structural differences between the four networks we examined. We found that the interpretation of smaller (remote) subgroups may differ if instead of friendship networks we studied communication networks such those that emerge on Twitter. Unlike the previous studies of Twitter communication n, Kappler, networks that showed clustering around political views (Arago Kaltenbrunner, Laniado, & Volkovich, 2013; Conover, Gonc S alves, Flammini, & Menczer, 2012; Khonsari et al., 2010), in our case, in particular in PRO1 and PRO2, nodes located in smaller (remote) subgroups were either subgroups of spam and marketing accounts or a subgroup of Crimean Tatars (an ethnic minority in Crimea) and their supporters, who were generally in support of the PRO1 group's Pro-Maidan views. More broadly, this article contributes to the research on online activist groups in a number of ways. First, it examined the use of an understudied social networking platform--VK, the largest platform in Eastern Europe. Most of the previous work on politically motivated online groups has focused primarily on Twitter and Facebook. Second, this work explored a unique case study where both camps actively used social media to organize online groups among their supporters. In many previous protests that relied on social media, social media were used primarily by just one of the sides in a conflict (usually by antiestablishment protesters). In the case of protests in Ukraine, there were two

144

Policy & Internet, 7:2

prominent camps, anti- and pro-government protesters, and both camps actively used social media to achieve their information and recruitment goals. Third, by examining social structures of the four VK groups, we established a number of baseline metrics for interpreting groups' social structures. With the newly discovered knowledge of the network properties and topology, we can now scale up our efforts to analyze and classify more online groups involved in this and other conflicts. By knowing what network properties and visualizations can tell us about a group's composition and dynamics, we may avoid performing a time consuming, manual labeling of emerging subgroups and also avoid running resource-intensive ERGM models. Our future work will involve the analysis of a larger number of online groups in order to validate the results we present in this article. Additionally, since the current work has focused primarily on examining the largest, most connected component in the social graphs, isolates (users who joined the group, but who do not have any "friends" there) have been largely excluded from the analysis. In the future, we will explore the roles of isolates in the group--whether they are there to lurk, spam, troll, or whether they are just fake accounts.

The Pro-Maidan camp was made up of anti-government (at the time), pro-Western groups that supported closer ties with the European Union. The Anti-Maidan camp was made up of proGovernment (at the time), pro-Russian groups that opposed them. 3.

One of few exceptions is a recent study on political polarization in Ukraine (Duvanova, Semenov, & Nikolaev, 2015) that compared social connections formed among VK users before and after the 2012 presidential election. Using the electoral map of Ukraine, the researchers found the network patterns were consistent with an increasing polarization among VK users relative to the 2011 preelection period. 5. Gaby and Caren's (2012) work on Facebook Occupy groups is also relevant here, but it did not examine the underlying social structures of the Occupy groups; thus it does not offer useful insights in terms of the possible influence of a user's location on tie formation in a Facebook group.

6. VK users from Russia were the largest group of users in the studied networks from countries other than Ukraine. 7. In recognition of the sensitive nature of the topic and ongoing nature of this conflict, we have decided not to publish any names of the groups, or names of group members to ensure their privacy, and not to include direct quotes from users posted to the group. 8. The VK user interface allows even nongroup members to "like" posts in the group. 9. As of July 28, 2014, there was only one discussion thread (started on July 9, 2014) with about 460 posts. Recent discussion topics have included how to help rebels in Donbas and how to avoid fighting in territories with civilians. 10. In all four networks, the largest connected component consisted of the majority of nodes. In the PRO1, PRO2, and ANTI1 networks, it represented 70­73 percent of members; in ANTI2, it included a relatively smaller majority (58 percent of all members), primarily due to the large number of isolated nodes (35 percent). 11. Colors are assigned to each subgroup automatically; as a result, some subgroups share the same color. 12. Since the majority of PRO1 group users (84 percent) were from Ukraine or Russia, only connections among users from these two countries were tested. 13. We used the "igraph" implementation of the Walktrap algorithm in Program R. 14. The visualization is using Tableau, popular software for advanced visual analytics. 15. The two accounts ranked as #100 and #101 had the same number of connections in the network; thus, we included both of them in the sample. 16. The reason for using the top-108 instead of the top-100 is because the accounts ranked 95­108 had the same number of friends and thus were all included in the sample. 17. Accused of cooperating with the German army, Crimean Tatars were deported to remote areas of Central Asia by the Soviet authorities after World War II, and only returned to Crimea in the 1990s after the Soviet Union collapsed (Zaloznaya & Gerber, 2012). 18. See, for example, The Guardian's reporting on this topic at: http://www.theguardian.com/world/ 2014/mar/05/tartar-ukraine-sunni-muslims-threat-russian-rule-crimea and http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/21/crimean-tatars-struggle-survival. 19. The accounts ranked 95­102 had the same number of friends and thus were all included in the sample. 20. The accounts ranked 98­103 had the same number of friends and thus were all included in the sample. 21. Hidden accounts are likely personal accounts that are also politically active. 22. Notably, the commenting feature was disabled and re-enabled a couple of times in PRO1. 23. Forty-four accounts identified themselves as being part of the Crimean Tatar community or their supporters.

Appendix B: Manual Coding of Most Connected User Profiles

Coding Procedure The coding was conducted in two stages: once the first coder (one of the authors) completed the initial coding, the second coder (another author) reviewed and validated the results and confirmed that the coding was done consistently. The coding comprised the following steps: each coder visited a user profile, and if it was not hidden, the coder reviewed the profile information (name, status line, interests, etc.), recent photos (if available), a list of groups the user belonged to, and the 10 most recent posts or reposts on the user's wall. The coding categories and rules are summarized below.
Coding Categories Category Hidden/private accounts Deleted accounts Marketing, spam, inactive or blocked accounts Coding Rule The account page was not public (i.e., only visible to other VK users or VK friends) The account page displayed a system message that it was deleted by its user The account was classified under this category if: · The account page displayed a system message that the account was suspended permanently or temporarily by the VK administrators due to suspicious activities; or · The majority of posts or reposts promoted products or services; or · The account was set up to share inappropriate/adult photos; or · The account was set up to share information about services to promote other VK pages or run online contests to increase the number of friends or likes; or · The account linked to a suspicious website which the VK platform labeled as such that was "created for the purpose of deceiving VK users with the intention of gaining profit;" or · The account page was empty (no posts) or inactive (included fewer than 10 posts or reposts and was not created recently) The account was classified under this category if the majority of recent posts or reposts included politically charged messages about policies, politicians, countries, political, or military events The account did not fit any of the above categories and appeared to belong to a "real" VK user (included a profile photo, profile information, etc.)

Politically active accounts Nonpolitically active accounts

Note: The limitation of the coding procedure is that it did not differentiate between individual versus organizational accounts or between accounts that were created using a real name versus those set up with a pseudonym.
