Introduction

Resulting from the open door policy and economic reforms in the 1980s, China has become "the world's labor factory" in the ongoing process of urbanization. It contributes not only to profound social changes in China but also a new working class comprised of 280 million Chinese migrant workers who drift to metropolises from rural areas trying to provide a better life for their families. Nowadays, "Made in China" products can be found in almost every corner of the world but little attention has been paid to those hands that created them. Chinese photographer Zhan Youbing is an exception. Zhan, starting as a migrant worker in 1995 in Dongguan, the biggest manufacturing city in Southern China, spent more than ten years working in factories, witnessing and understanding the struggles of migrant workers. Since 2006, he has taken over four hundred thousand photographs documenting the factory life of his fellow workers. 1

The Archive of Modern Conflict (AMC) in Toronto has a photographic collection of thirty handmade photographic albums by Zhan. The subject of this applied thesis Work. The Manufacturing Industry in Dongguan: Real-Life Stories of Migrant Workers, by far the biggest and the most comprehensive album of Zhan's work, includes fifty photographs taken in Dongguan between 2008 and 2014. It also contains personal belongings of migrant workers collected by Zhan. Individually, each item is treated as a single object whose role is as important as

that of the photographs in presenting the history of Chinese migrant workers. Together, they form a representative image of Chinese migrant workers, who work hard and live in obscurity.

This thesis is a practical project divided into four sections. The first section is a literature review that covers the unique social status of migrant workers within the historical context of China's urbanization. It also introduces literature on Chinese migrant workers describing the relationship between Chinese documentary photography and the growing attention drawn to Chinese migrant workers. Lastly, it reviews existing literature on the preservation of photographic albums and case studies of photographic albums in institutions. The second section provides an overview of the album, including its content, provenance, and exhibition history both in mainland China and overseas.

The third section addresses the practical component of the thesis. It begins with my translation of the introduction of the album, originally written in Chinese by Zhan Youbing. It covers a brief biography of Zhan describing his experience in becoming a photographer from a migrant worker, and his personal perspective on this social group. This section includes a complete illustrated catalogue of the album with a preface introducing the definition of each field of the catalogue. All the captions are translated into English in order to make the album more accessible to AMC's curatorial staff and future researchers. The fourth section analyzes the preservation issues of the album and provides an illustrated step-

by-step instruction for constructing custom housing for the album.

Chapter 1. Literature Review

Over the past 35 years, China has become the "world's factory" resulting from its open-door policy and economic reform. These changes brought about the rise of a new working class comprised of rural migrant workers. The maker of Work. The Manufacturing Industry in Dongguan: Real-Life Stories of Migrant Workers, Zhan Youbing, was one of them. Compared to the extensive attention given to China's thriving economy, the existence of this social group has been neglected for three decades. Now it has been gradually brought to the attention of different Chinese social classes and the rest of the world. The published writings discussed in this literature survey on Chinese migrant workers include books, critical essays, journals etc. However, studies on photography about Chinese migrant workers are relatively limited. The literature review is divided into three sections: the first discusses the formation of the new generation of migrant workers and their unique social status. The second focuses on Chinese documentary photography about migrant workers. The last section reviews the preservation of photographic albums, as well as various case studies of the conservation of albums in different institutions.

According to Han Changbing, Chinese Agriculture Secretary, migrant workers are divided into three generations. 2 The first generation, who appeared in the 80s,
1F

were farmers from the countryside who came to work in the cities. They

recognized themselves as both workers and peasants, drifting to the city while retaining their roots and souls in the hometown soil. Growing during the late 80s, the second generation, as Han puts it, has become the main force of migrant workers. And those born in the early 1990s are referred to as the third generation, namely the new generation of migrant workers. In Han's definition, the ample scale of the second and the third generation constitutes the main body of modern migrant workers. Han points out the inherent characteristics of the new generation of migrant workers. Different from the previous generations, their emotional attachment towards soil and agriculture diminished greatly once they adjusted to the life style of modern cities. Eager to improve their life, they worked hard to fight for a place in the city. Gradually, they became obsessed with the favorable conditions of urban living and resisted any return to the rural regions. When exposed to certain prejudice and inequality, the new generation of migrant workers demanded the same equal rights as those of urban citizens.

Wang Chunguang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, began his studies on the floating population of the third generation of migrant workers in 2001. In The Social Identity of the New Generation of Migrant Workers and Relationship of Urban and Rural Integration (2001), Wang asserts that an intergenerational difference has occurred. 3 Unlike their parents, migrants of the
2F

new generation are granted greater access to higher levels of education and more career opportunities, which to some degree have become their primary

motive to work in the cities. He also concludes that the social identity of the new generation tends to become more and more indefinite than that of the previous generation, hence, it will be difficult for them to relocate to rural areas in the future.

In 2000s, many Chinese scholars embarked on the investigation of migrant workers in order to better classify the new generation. The criteria are chronicled in Luo Xia and Wang Chunguang's The Causation and Action - Choice of the New Generation of Rural Floating Population (2003) 4, Zhao Fang's "The New
3F

Generation"- A Concept Which is Difficult to be Defined (2003) 5 , Wang

of New Generation Peasant Workers (2009)7. These discussions about defining
6F

migrant workers fall into two categories; one is a comprehensive study focusing on the classification and the group characteristics of the whole migrant worker community; another studies the characterization of the social group, emphasizing specific aspects of the new generation of migrant workers, such as their mobility and employment, life and consumption, marriages and crimes, social recognition and urban integration, and social welfare and political aspirations.

In regards to the comprehensiveness of the social group, Yang Juhua (professor at Department of Population and Development Research Center, Renmin University of China) summarizes seven major features of the floating population: low incomes, low occupational prestige, low social status, long working hours, insufficient welfare benefits, and poor accommodations. 8 Yang explains that the
7F

more the migrant workers desire to fit into cities, the greater the conflict between the reality and the ideal. Therefore, rural workers are always trapped in a psychological cycle of desire, despair, and retreat. According to Wang Xingzhou (2008), the third generation of migrant workers tend to accumulate more human capital9 and a better individual quality of life; He describes them as an ambitious
8F

and aspiring group who crave fair market discipline, liberty, equality and independence. 10 Chinese economists Wu Hongyu and Xie Guoqiang (2006)
9F

point out that with better educational attainment, the new generation of peasant workers push themselves to integrate faster into urban life. They constantly change careers in a short period of time, aiming for higher incomes and a better quality of life. 11

Although this special social group is rooted in China, it also attracts western scholars' attention. Leslie T. Chang, a former correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, provides a new insight into the female migrant workers of the third generation. For the first two decades (1980-2000), male peasant workers had dominated the field, while the third generation is more gender balanced with a considerable number of female workers actively involved in various industries. In Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China (2009), Chang sheds light on the advent and transition of Chinese female workers during China's social reform. With two particular case studies, the author demonstrates the hardship and struggle of female migrant workers. After three years' observation, Chang discovered a typical career pattern of these female workers. Almost every female manager Chang interviewed started her career as a production worker. Mandated by factory owners, they worked countless hours in hazardous conditions in order to increase profits for the company. Additionally, for these urban migrants, lying about education and work experience become a requisite for getting ahead. 12

In terms of the characterization of the new generation who were born in early 1990s, Luo Xia and Wang Chunguang (2003) assert that different from their parents, rural workers nowadays have higher and higher expectations for their future when their goals are no longer limited to the needs of survival. 13 In the

view of Pan Jiqing (2009), editor of Modern Youth Studies, the new generation of peasant workers consider rural-urban migration as a life-changing choice. In other words, they are willing to sacrifice everything to achieve success. However, due to deficiencies in the urban-rural dual system and their lack of knowledge and skills, migrant workers have difficulty in protecting their individual rights and interests. 14
13F

The social identity of migrant workers is another broadly discussed issue. Hu Xiaohong (2008) reveals that the third generation of migrant workers tend to be ambiguous, uncertain and self-contradictory when it comes to the recognition and evaluation of self-identity in the society. Hu adds that these inner dilemmas and anxieties are attributed to the restless minds of the third generation. 15 They
14F

identify themselves as a particular social group yet can refer to neither the urban nor rural communities to which they belong. 16 According to Chinese economists
15F

Liu Chuanjiang and Wang Guohua (2009), this social group is also denoted as "the marginals" and "the amphibians" of cities where they can neither belong nor retreat. 17

These articles also demonstrate how news photography

embodies the social value of migrant workers.

Comprised of over three hundred photographs, Ouyang Xingkai's exhibition catalogue People's Road (2012) provides a visual interpretation of the living space of migrant workers. On Renmin Road, Changsha, Hunan Province, hundreds of peasant workers squeeze into a three-story building divided into 190 rooms in a total floor area of only 1680 square meters. In other words, the available space for each tenant is merely four square meters. Photographs from People's Road depict the relationship between the people at the bottom of the society and the urban space in the development of urbanization. Hao Meijin (2014) comments that for these migrant workers, the crowed narrow visual space in People's Road implies the bondage and oppression of urbanization. Essentially, the power relations between human and space contributes to the construction of migrant workers' marginalized social status. 25 He Guangyi's

Photographic albums of migrant workers constitute a major part of industrial and cultural heritage in China. The preservation and care of photographic albums have become increasingly prominent in museums, galleries, private archives and photographic institutions. Published on The Library of Congress website in 1991, "Preservation of Scrapbooks and Albums" addresses various preservation basics, including the reasonable range of temperature and relative humidity control for the useful life span of albums, the influence of excessive exposure of albums to light, the physical storage requirements of albums of different sizes, their handling, conservation treatments and reformatting. 28 Similarly, "Preserving and
27F

provides

recommendations concerning the storage of albums accordingly. 29 In terms of housing methods, Carlson and Brown's "Boxes for the Protection of Books: Their Design and Construction" (1994)30 and Denise Psaila's "Design and Materials for

In conclusion, migrant workers have gradually become a significant subject matter in the field of Chinese literature research and photographic research. However, the archival and published sources on photography about Chinese migrant workers are still limited and studies on photography about migrant

Chapter 2. Overview of the Album

Made in December 2015, the Chinese photographic album that is the object of this thesis is entitled Work. The Manufacturing Industry in Dongguan: Real-life Stories of Migrant Workers, 33 and signed on the front cover by the photographer
32F

Zhan Youbing. The album's handwritten title page includes the title, the date, and the photographer's signature, and is then followed by a two-page introduction Zhan wrote in pencil in simplified Chinese 34 . The album comprises fifty fiber3F

based D2T2 prints 35, each approximately 34 x 23 cm (13.39 x 9.05 inches), and
34F

other objects relating to Chinese migrant workers including a discarded photograph found by Zhan, an electronic component used for the production of hard disk heads, a clock card, a notice, a page of a handwritten canteen menu, a page of handwritten graffiti and a page of corporate seals.

The overall size of the album is 42.5 x 30 x 6 cm (16.73 x 11.81 x 2.36 inches), which is by far the largest within Zhan's photographic collection at the AMC. Both front and back covers are made out of kraft paper covered with denim. The combination of these materials, in my interpretation, is a representation of the

manufacturing industry or the product of Chinese migrant workers' labour. 36 The
35F

title "Work" in Chinese characters is custom-made with black cloth and stitched on the front cover. In terms of structure, the album is bound with white cotton strings on the left hand side and opens from right to left, as in the Western style. Each page of the album contains one photograph or one object mounted on kraft paper, with captions written horizontally in Chinese by Zhan, primarily introducing the subject of each image. Interestingly, the binding of this album is similar to the traditional Chinese stitched bookbinding, which first appeared in the Ming Dynasty (the sixteen century). 37 Originally, Chinese stitched books were bound at
36F

the right and opened from left to right. This structure was decided by the layout of the contents which, in ancient China, were written vertically. However, this photographic album was made in 2015 and adopted the modern writing style. Therefore, the layout of the texts is no longer vertical but horizontal, which also explains why its bookbinding is on the opposite side, which is different from the traditional one.

The history of the AMC acquisition goes back to November 21st, 2015, when Zhan, as the Vice President of the Changan Photography Association, was invited to the Eleventh Lianzhou International Photography Exhibition in Lianzhou, Guangdong. On this occasion, Martin Parr 38 and WassinkLundgren 39 co-curated a book fair called "Chinese
37F 38F

Photography Fair" in order to present modern China via the lens of Chinese photographers. Zhan brought eight of his handmade photographic albums to the exhibition and showed them to Ruben Lundgren. Lundgren was attracted to these albums at first glance and later recommended them to Martin Parr. Three minutes after reviewing the albums, Parr made the first purchase of one of Zhan's handmade albums Work Break. 40 Since then, more and more private
39F

collectors and archives have purchased Zhan's work, and the AMC is one of them buying a collection of 30 albums. Later in January 2017, the collection of 30 handmade photographic albums by Zhan was shipped to the AMC in Toronto for cataloguing and translation.

2.2 Exhibition History

Before the AMC's acquisition, Zhan's migrant worker collection had been exhibited twice in Mainland China. In May 2016, it was first shown in "the 12th China International Cultural Industries Fair" in Shenzhen. As stated in the preface of the exhibition catalogue, Zhan's photographs showed the real faces and state of migrant workers. 41 Later in November, the collection was exhibited in the
40F

"2016 Taizhou Photography Biennial: `Encounter: Handmade Photo Albums.'" 42
41F

As photography critic Gu Zheng put it, Zhan comprehensively documented the lives of employees of the multinational foundry business, and gave a persuasive visual interpretation of the indifference of the production machines and the staff management in the factory setting. 43

3.1 Translated introduction of the album

Documenting the Life and Work of Fellow Workers

In late 1995, I was discharged from the People's Armed Police Corps of Sichuan and went back to my hometown Hubei. A week later, I set foot on a train to the South and began my journey as a migrant worker. After doing 102 push-ups in a row for the boss, I became the security guard of Shenzhen Lianwu Hotel. Three months later, I moved to Shenzhen Airport Hotel, still as a security guard, and my salary was raised from 450 yuan to 800 yuan. A year later, I became the Dean of General Affairs of Shenzhen Xixiang Baifa No.2 Toy Factory, in charge of personnel administration of the whole factory. Later on, I worked for hardware and electroplating factories and electronics factories for three years. After that, I quit several jobs and had been fired several times.

Constantly changing jobs, I was completely rootless and adrift, going with the flow of unemployment, from seeking a job to keeping a job. My mind was always occupied with survival.

In 2000, I was employed as a security supervisor at Dongguan Shili Technology and Electronics Factory, and spent 13 years in this large-scaled Hong Kong-

20

funded enterprise, located in Dongguan, Guangdong. At first, I photographed for the factory newspaper with passion. However, my passion for photography had got out of hand to the extent that photography occupied all of my leisure time. I began by photographing various kinds of activities held at the factory, staff ID cards, and meetings. Gradually, I got bored. Then I tried photographing the daily life of my colleagues, and posted these photographs online. Surprisingly, the photographs attracted attention and comments from many photography teachers. I was encouraged and gained more confidence. Then I embarked on planning my shooting schedule. As I read (about photography), I started to think about my approach to documenting the life and work of colleagues and to document the development and changes in the industrial zone.

Since 2006, I have broken three cameras and have taken over three hundred thousand photographs of the life of migrant workers. In addition, I have collected a large quantity of recordings, videos and objects relevant to migrant workers.

I am a farmer, but I know nothing about farming. Having worked in the industrial zone for years, I am familiar with it and the daily life of fellow workers. The industrial zone is filled with adjacent factories processing imported supplied material. Owners of these enterprises are foreign businesspersons, while employees are all migrant workers. Always busy manufacturing on the assembly lines and working three hours overtime everyday, the youthful spirit of migrant workers has gone, just like the export of products.

21

China's manufacturing industry is known around the world, while the migrant workers behind it are obscure.

We neglected the sunk cost 45 by regarding the environmental resources, air,
4F

water and labor as inexhaustible. Yet we were constantly suffering from the retaliation of nature. We began to think of what lessons needed to be learnt in the developing process of urbanization. In this, photography has provided us with a clear mirror.

Migrant workers are peasants who are manufacturing industrial goods sold around the world. With cameras, I captured the life and work of myself and my fellow workers. I documented not only the manufacturing process of these industrial goods but also the reality of migrant workers, who manufacture industrial goods and are being treated as the means of production. The increase in capital improved the lifestyle of migrant workers, yet the role of these migrant workers as profit makers has never changed. What migrant workers sacrificed was not merely their labour; it was also their youth, health, familial love and even life. Eventually, they were relentlessly discarded as waste by the logic of capitalism.

"Sunk costs are costs which, once committed, cannot be recovered. Sunk costs arise because some activities require specialized assets that cannot readily be diverted to other uses," R. S. Khemani and D. M. Shapiro, "Glossary of Industrial Organisation Economics and Competition Law," Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 1993, accessed April 10, 2017, http://www.oecd.org/regreform/sectors/2376087.pdf.

The photographs I have taken gradually take on the face of history. Let us face the past and reflect on the development of the future.

All photographs were taken in Changan Town, Dongguan, Guangdong Province. (Expect for those with specific location marks)

Chapter 4. Preservation/Housing Instruction 4.1 Preservation Issues 4.1.1 Condition of the Album
The album is in excellent condition at first glance. Benefit from its unique binding style and the hardness of the covers, the album is fairly firm and stable. No significant deterioration or damage is observed. However, cockling has started to appear along the edges of the photographs. According to my preliminary assessment, the cause of this problem may be either the high acidity of the paper 46 or the unknown adhesive used to adhere photographs to the mounts,
45F

since both have direct contact with the images.

4.1.2 Tests before Preservation

In order to prepare the best preservation strategy for the album, the first step is to test the acidity of the fiber base to decide whether pH neutral archival paper should be considered to protect the prints from any acidic material. 47 It merely
46F

requires a simple tool to complete the acidity test, which is a pH pen. To make the album more permanent, the fiber base must have an alkaline reserve which means a pH of 7.0 or above. Basically, marking the test sample with a pH pen
Most of kraft paper is manufactured with acidic sulfite so I assume it is acidic. Honghi Tran and Esa Vakkilainnen, "The Kraft Chemical Recovery Process," Tappi.org, 2008, accessed August 02, 2017, https://www.tappi.org/content/events/08kros/manuscripts/1-1.pdf. 47 According to AMC's policy, no destructive tests is allowed to conduct on any collection, therefore the test sample of the fiber base was provided by photographer Zhan Youbing from Dongguan, China.
91
46

allows the color of the ink to reveal whether the paper is acidic or alkaline. Purple indicates a pH of 7.0 or greater, yellow indicates a pH below 6.5, which is acidic and not recommended for photographic storage. 48 Surprisingly, the result of the
47F

test showed that the acidity of the fiber base is neutral (alkaline) (see fig.1). Therefore, the cockling problem of the prints is probably the result of the unknown type of adhesive used to adhere the photographs. My hypothesis is that the strength of the adhesive is so strong that it is keeping the photographs from lying flat, a common deterioration issue of photographic albums. 49
48F

(fig.1) Purple indicates a pH of 7 or above

4.2 Making of the Box
Considering the size of the album and the preservation issues discussed above, the most effective housing method for the album is an archival clamshell box, which is constructed with two trays that fold into each other. It not only offers strong and necessary protection for the album against dirt, harmful light and usual wear but also prevents further damage such as exposure to heat and humidity.

Tools and Materials needed:  Double Walled Cardboard  Pencil  Metal Ruler  Bone Folder  Blade  Paper Clamps (2)  Cutting Mat  PH Neutral Adhesive (Carr Mclean) Steps: 1. I first measured the dimensions of the album:

93

L ­ Length of album = 42.5 cm (16.7 inches) W ­ Width of album = 30 cm (11.8 inches) D ­ Depth of album = 6 cm (2.4 inches) The overall dimensions of the album were 42.5 x 30 x 6cm (16.7 x 11.8 x 2.4 inches).

2. I then sized the clamshell box based on following dimensions: TB ­ Thickness of board = 0.5cm (0.2 inches) L ­ Length of album = 42.5 cm (16.7 inches) W ­ Width of album = 30 cm (11.8 inches) D ­ Depth of album = 6 cm (2.4 inches)

The overall dimensions of the box were Length = 2L + 3D + 8TB = 2 (42.5) + 3 (6) + 8 (0.5) = 107 cm (42.1 inches) Width = 1W + 2D + 5TB = 30 + 2(6) + 5(0.5)

94

= 44.5 cm (17.5 inches)

Therefore, a 107 x 44.5 cm (42.1 x 17.5 inches) double walled cardboard was needed to complete the box.

Once the board was ready, I measured and marked the size of the lid and the base of the clamshell box following the instructions below. (Working across the board, horizontally, was the best method for avoiding mistakes.)

3. I measured the length of the lid and the bottom: L of lid = 42.5 +3TB = 44 cm (17.3 inches) L of bottom = 42.5 + TB = 43 cm (16.9 inches)

a. I first measured the overall length of the lid: D + L of Lid + Spine of the box = 6.5 cm + 44 cm + 6.5 cm (2.6 + 17.3 + 2.6 inches) b. Next, I measured the overall length of the bottom: L of Bottom + D
95

= 43 cm + 6.5 cm (16.9 + 2.6 inches)

4. I drew the vertical lines, as following:

Next, I marked the sides of the box as the Lid and the Bottom to avoid measurement mistakes.

5. I turned the board so the lid was in front:

6. Next, I measured the overall width of the lid: W of lid = 30 + 3TB = 31.5 cm (12.2 inches)
96

D + W of lid + D = 6.5 cm + 31.5 cm + 6.5 cm (2.6 + 12.4 +2.6 inches)

7. I connected the pencil marks together to create the spine:

(I reminded myself not to carry the line across the spine because the base was supposed to be smaller than the lid; otherwise, the box would not close.)

8. Once the lid was measured, I turned the board around so the base was in front. The base should be thinner than the lid. I measured 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) (TB) from the spine of the base, as following:

97

9. After scratching out the box, the next step was to deal with the corners and made sure they fold in nicely. I measured each corner in a thickness of board (0.5cm) (0.2 inches):

10. Working from the new corner lines, I drew a diagonal line to the corner of the cardboard and labeled the pieces that need to be cut out with an "X" (including the outer spine pieces):

98

11. I drew a thumb cut in the middle of the edge of the lid, which made it easier to open the box.

12. Next, I scored the new lines that were just created. Then I scored the rest of the lines of the board. (I tried scoring vertically because if scoring sideways, it was hard to get a straight line.)

13. Because the board thickness was reduced in the base in order to make it smaller than the lid (Step 8), in order to make the box close, the board thickness must be decreased from two outer edges of the base. As shown below, I trimmed 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) from both sides. Then, the base should have the proper shape.

99

14. Next, I carefully cut out the corners of the lid along with the diagonal line. I started with the edge connecting the width to the side and cut until reaching the corner.

15. When those corners were cut out, I then cut out the inner flaps of the spine and the corners of the bottom, which were the squares marked with an "X".

100

16. I tried prepping all my folds before I glued the box together to make sure everything was in place.

17. Once I made sure everything worked well, I put a small amount of PH neutral adhesive in the middle of the tabs and glued the tabs to the inside width. Next, I used the paper clamps to secure the tabs in position while the glue dried, for 10 minutes. Then, I removed the paper clamps and the box was completed.

101

18. I slid the album into the bottom of the box.

19. Finally, I closed the lid and labeled the album with its index number "LFA30427_30".

Conclusion

In my opinion, Work. The Manufacturing Industry in Dongguan: Real-life Stories of Migrant Workers is a unique, well-planned handmade photo album of great social meaning and historical values. With this album, Zhan documents the life of a neglected social group in this particular area, accumulating the collective memory of migrant workers and capturing the spirit of an age. These photographs reflect the situation of migrant workers in China's social transformation, aiming to demonstrate the maker's thoughts about modernization, urbanization, population movements and social equity. It also opens up a window for viewers to pay attention to this social group and reflect on the ongoing process of urbanization.

This applied project has eliminated the language barrier by translating the texts and captions and providing a historical investigation of the social identity of Chinese migrant workers. Cataloguing and digitization of the album made it much easier and convenient for staff and researchers to review the contents of the album and thus avoids unnecessary handling. Last but not least, the preservation issues addressed and the illustrated instructions for the preservation of the album are useful not only for the care of the album but also for future researchers to preserve similar photographic collection.
