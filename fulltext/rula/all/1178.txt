Abstract
Studies of Potential Sources That Contributed To Atmospheric Mercury in Toronto, Canada
Master of Applied Science, 2008 Irene Cheng Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University

The objectives of the study were to identify sources of mercury (Hg) measured in downtown Toronto, Canada using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), Principal Components Analysis (PCA), ratio analy sis, back trajectories, and correlation analyses . Atmospheric Hg species (i.e ., GEM , PHg<2.5 , RGM) and air pollutants measured from December 2003 to November 2004 were the input variables. Model results suggest industrial sources (chemical production , metal production, sewage treatment), rather than coal combustion, were the major contributors to measured Hg levels. Both the PMF model and PCA identified factors that cannot be characterized using the National Pollutant Release Inventory emissions data . Correlation analyses revealed direct emissions were the sources of RGM in spring, summer and fall , and the occurrence of GEM oxidation by ozone in the summer. Elevated Hg events are attributed to emissions from regional point sources, photochemical processes involving ozone, and potentially urban sources near the sampling site.

1. Introduction
1.1 Why Mercury Research? 1.1.1 Where Mercury is Found and Used

Mercury is found naturally in a mercuric sulfide mineral called cinnabar, which is

~ 86%

mercury by weight, and in rocks and fossil fuels (Environment Canada, 2004a). Depending on the type offossil fuel , e.g. hard coal, brown coal, crude oil, or natural gas, and the location where the excavation of the fossil fuel took place, the mercury content can vary. It ranges from 0.011.5 g/ton in coal, 0.01-0.5 g/ton in crude oil, and 0-5.0 mg/m 3 in natural gas (Pacyna et a!. , 2006). Mercury is currently being produced in .Spain, North and South America and Asia (mainly in China and the countries of former USSR) (Pacyna et a!. , 2006) and used mainly by industries to manufacture products. Mercury is consumed in chloralkali facilities, which uses mercury electrodes to manufacture sodium hydroxide and chlorine that can be made into plastics and pesticides. It is also used in gold mining, where mercury fomls an amalgam with gold in order to separate gold from the rest of the ore. Dental amalgam, which is used to fill tooth cavities. is composed of metals and mercury and has led to widespread exposure to mercury (Gochfeld , 2003). The manufacturing of fluorescent light bulbs. electrical devices, and older types of themlometers, blood pressure meters, manometers, and hydrometers also contain elemental mercury . Metallic mercury is ideal for these applications because of its unique physical properties, such as high electrical conductivity. boiling point and density. A comparison of the consumption patterns between early 1970 (peak global Hg consumption) and late 1990s in the U.S. and Sweden. shown in Table 1.1. illustrates that the consumption of mercury of various industrial activities have changed over time.

1.1.2 Mercury Emissions from Anthropogenic Sources
Despite the improvements to reduce the use of mercury. industries account for 30% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions, which reached 2.200 tons in 2000 (Pacyna et aI., 2006). Anthropogenic sources can contribute up to 50% of the mercury emitted into the atmosphere. with the other 50% due to natural emissions from so il. vegetation. water and volcanic activity (Bash et ai., 2004; Pacyna et al.. 2006). However, mercury in soil. vegetation and water likely originated from the deposition of atmospheric Hg that was emitted from anthropogenic sources (Pacyna et ai. , 2006). Industrial emissions of mercury mainly come from gold production (248 tons), non-felTous metal production (149 tons) and cement production (140 tons). The remaining two-thirds of the anthropogenic emissions are due to stationary combustion sources, which include coal-fired power generation and industriallresidential boilers. Pacyna et

2

a1. (2006) reported that China (605 tons), South Africa (257 tons), India (150 tons), Japan (144 tons), Australia (124 tons) and the USA (109 tons) were the major emitters of mercury in 2000. Natural or re-emitted and anthropogenic sources of mercury are listed in Table 1.2.

(2007) Eckley and Branfireun (2008)

In Canada, the major emission sources of Hg are base metal processing facilities (2.8 tons in 2000), waste incinerators (1.2 tons in 2000) including municipal solid wastes. medical , hazardous and sewage sludge wastes, and coal-fired electric power generation plants (2.7 tons in 2003) (CCME, 2000. 2006). The use of mercury-containing products ends up in the waste ..,

.J

and/or metal recycling stream leading to mercury emissions from these industries (Hagreen and Lourie, 2004). Hagreen and Lourie (2004) estimated that the use and disposal of Hg-containing products release more than 2 tons of mercury into the air each year, which is comparable to the amount released from Hg point sources. Current Hg inventory indicate that mercury emissions in North America and Europe have been decreasing mainly because they have vastly reduced the production and consumption of mercury by using mercury substitutes and improving the mercury recovery process. However, the study by Pacyna et a!. (2006) predicts that emissions will continue to increase in Africa and Asia due to the increasing energy demand and reliance on fossil fuels.

1.1.3 Mercury in the Atmosphere

Atmospheric mercury is operationally divided into three different forms: elemental mercury (GEM). reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) and mercury bounded to airborne particles (PHg) . RGM is the divalent inorganic form of mercury (Hg (II)) that exists in the gas phase (Lindberg and Stratton, 1998). Most of the mercury emitted from point sources is in the form of GEM , but RGM can also be directly emitted from sources, such as coal combustion, due to interactions with flue gas molecules, surface of particulate matter, and/or sorbents used to capture mercury (Ralston et aI. , 2005 ; Tang et a!. , 2007). Comprising about 98% of the mercury in the atmosphere under normal environmental conditions (except in the polar spring after polar sunrise), GEM has the longest atmospheric residence time (e.g. 4 months to 1 year (Schroeder and Munthe, 1998)) of all the mercury species and is capable of long distance transport, e.g. globally. RGM and PHg species have shorter atmospheric residence times (e.g. hours to few weeks (Manolopoulos, 2007b)) than GEM, which means they are more likely to deposit at

4

distances closer to the source of emission. The atmospheric residence times of mercury species is dictated by their different physical and chemical properties as shown in Table 1.3. Elemental mercury has a higher vapour pressure than its inorganic forms, such as mercuric chloride (HgCh) , at the same temperature (Schroeder and Munthe, 1998). Furthem10re, ROM is 5 orders of magnitude more soluble in water than OEM (Lynam and Keeler, 2005), which increases the chance of ROM deposition . Due to its higher surface reactivity, ROM also readily adsorbs onto aerosols and particulate matter to form PHg, which are also subject to deposition .

1.1.4 Mercury Transformation, Transport and Fate in the Environment
Although the background mercury levels in the ambient air (1.7 ng/m 3 reported by Ebinghaus et al. 2003) are not high enough to lead to direct human health impacts. elemental mercury can be transformed to Hg(IJ) (the divalent, inorganic stable form) by oxidants in the air and transported to other environmental media. such as soil , vegetation, and water, via wet and

5

dry deposition (Environment Canada, 2004a). Once deposited in water, sediments, and wetlands, Hg(II) can be transformed by bacteria under acidic and anaerobic conditions to methylmercury compounds, the most toxic forms of mercury to living organisms that can be bioaccumulated in the food chain (Environment Canada, 2004a).

1.1.5 Health Effects from Mercury Exposure
Human exposure to methylmercury may come from the consumption of methylmercurycontaminated fish and seafood , such as in the cases of Minamata disease in Japan, due to its ability to bioaccumulate in the aquatic food chain. It can also come from inhalation of elemental mercury vapor, such as the cases of Mad Hatters disease that affected fur and felt hat makers (Asano et aI. , 2000). Methylmercury exposure is a more serious problem because the body absorbs
~95%

of the methylmercury ingested through the gastrointestinal tract. lungs and skin,

compared to 50-100% absorption of elemental mercury vapor inhaled through the lungs (Gochfeld , 2003 ; Honda et aI. , 2006). The ability for methylmercury to transfer to the fetus and cause permanent kidney damage and neurological disorders in humans (e .g. , lack of muscle coordination and tremors) have led to increase awareness of the pollutant and monitoring of the mercury levels in the environment through the research community and government policies (Gochfeld , 2003 ; Honda et aI. , 2006).

1.2 Introduction to Source Identification Methods
To investigate the sources contributing to air pollutant concentrations at a receptor/sampling site, studies have used receptor models, such as Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) model (Davis et aI. , 1997; Heaton et aI. , 1992: Watson et aI. , 2001), Positive Matrix

6

Factorization (PMF) (Brinkman et aI., 2006; Brown et aI., 2007; Keeler, 2006; Lee et ai., 2003), Unmix (Keeler, 2006; Lewis et ai., 2003), and Factor Analysis/Principal Components Analysis (PCA) (Kim and Kim, 2001; Liu et ai. , 2007; Lynam and Keeler, 2006; Temme et ai. , 2007), as well as back trajectory modeling (Lee et ai. , 2003; Lee and Hopke, 2006; Lynam and Keeler, 2005), atmospheric pollutants ratio analysis (Jaffe et ai. , 2005; Lynam and Keeler, 2005 ; Manolopoulos et ai. , 2007b; Poissant et ai., 2004), and correlation analysis (Han et ai. , 2004; Kim and Kim, 2001; Lindberg and Stratton, 1998; Lynam and Keeler, 2005). These models can identify the types of sources by using air pollutant concentrations measured at the source and/or sampling site, whereas dispersion models require prior knowledge of the source profiles and interactions between the pollutant and other chemical constituents, and meteorological forecast data to predict the air pollutant concentrations at the receptor (Hopke, 2003). The CMB model has been used to identify sources of particulate matter and volatile organic compounds in air and pollutants in soil and deposition . Mathematically, each of the chemical species at the receptor is expressed as the sum of the products of the composition of chemical species at the source and the contribution of the source to the receptor (Hopke, 2003). The model assumption that all significant sources have been clearly identified and their emissions have been fully quantified (Capita, 1999: Chow and Watson, 2002) is invalid for identifying sources ofHg because there are potentially urban sources that have not been identified and reported in emission inventory. Therefore, this model was not chosen for the analysis of the Hg species data set. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and Unmix models have been commonly used to apportion sources of particulate matter and pollutants in precipitation. One of the main advantages of the PMF and Unmix models over CMB models is that the number of sources and source profiles are not required to run the modei. The models

7

only require the input of the measured pollutant concentrations at the receptor/sampling site. The models output a set of factors that contain some of the pollutants in the original data set, which can be used to characterize sources, and the relative impacts of each source to the pollutant concentrations at the sampling site (Eberly, 2005). Unlike the Unmix model , PMF has an additional feature that allows the input of data uncertainties, such as analytical and instrumentation uncertainties and detection limits (Keeler, 2006). Data containing large uncertainties would be down-weighted in the model due to low signal-to-noise ratio (Eberly,

2005), so that the more accurate data points would have a larger influence on the model.
Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been applied to atmospheric mercury concentrations to identifY emission sources. Similar to the PMF model , PCA is used to group a large set of related variables (e.g. , measured air pollutant concentrations) into a smaller set of factors while maximizing as much of the variance in the variables as possible (Garson, 2008; Pallant, 2005). One of the advantages of PCA is that there are several criteria that must be met to determine whether PCA is suitable for analyzing a data set and the number of factors to retain . The major disadvantage of statistical model s. such as the PMF model and PCA, is the assumption that the Hg species do not undergo transformation during transport. Back trajectories track the movement of an air parcel from the sampling location backwards in time using meteorological data (Draxler and Rolph, 2003). Unlike PMF and PCA. the back trajectories model pollutant transport by wind. However, the trajectory path might not represent the path of an Hg plume due to plume di spersion. Atmospheric pollutants ratio analysis involves the comparison of air pollutant concentration ratios (e.g., N0 2/Hg. PM2S/Hg, S02/Hg, RGM/PHg) between the sources and receptor/sampling site. The advantage of ratio analysis over the PMF model and PCA is that it can identify sources based on the proximity of the sources to the sampling location. instead of

8

using factors, which may not be well defined to characterize the sources (Manolopoulos et aI. , 2007b). The potential disadvantages of this method are the uncertainties regarding emissions inventory data and the extent of the transformation processes (e.g. , gas partitioning, chemical reactions) and deposition processes between a source and the sampling site (Jaffe et aI. , 2005 ; Manolopoulos et aI., 2007b). Correlation analysis is useful for source identification because the correlation between Hg species and criteria air pollutants (e.g., NO x, S02), which are commonly emitted from combustion or industrial sources, can be used to infer the types of sources. A more in-depth discussion and application of the models/data analysis methods are presented in the Site

Description and Data Analysis Methods chapter.

1.3 Rationale and Significance of Research into Hg Source Identification

Mercury emitted from anthropogenic sources is capable of transporting in the atmosphere globally and transforming into inorganic forms, which can be readily converted into the toxic methylmercury compounds. Mercury speciation studies are, therefore, necessary because different physical and chemical prope11ies ofHg species affect atmospheric transport, reactivity, bioavailability and toxicity of the chemical. Many of these studies are short-term, and the measurements of mercury species occurred in non-urban enviroml1ents (Gabriel et al.. 2005 ; Landis et aI. , 2004; Lynam and Keeler, 2005 ; Poissant et aI. , 2004; Poissant et ai. , 2005). There are several short-term (Gabriel et al.. 2005 ; Kim and Kim, 2001 ; Lynam and Keeler, 2005) and long-term (Liu et aI. , 2007 ; Rutter et aI. , 2008; Stamenkovic et al.. 2007) mercury speciation studies conducted in an urban atmosphere. The long-term Hg speciation measurements in urban environments are necessary because studies have found significantly higher Hg concentrations in urban atmosphere than background levels (background: 1.5-2 .0 ng/m 3 ; urban atmosphere: 2.0-4. 1 ng/m , Stamenkovic et al.. 2007). The long-term studies conducted in Detroit (Liu et al.. 2007)
3

9

and in Toronto (Song, 2005) observed large temporal variability and frequent concentration peaks of RGM and PHg<2.5 species over a period of one year, which were likely influenced by local and/or regional point sources. A recent analysis of total gaseous mercury (TGM) measured at the Canadian Atmospheric Mercury Measurement Network (CAMNet) sites over a 10-year period found that the changes to local and/or regional emission sources has led to a decline in TGM concentrations in rural areas and nearby urban centers (Temme et aI., 2007). Mercury species concentrations measured in urban Detroit (Lynam and Keeler, 2005) and Milwaukee (Rutter et a!., 2008) have been attributed to numerous point sources located within 100 km of the sampling site, such as coal utilities, steel mills and metals processing facilities, medical and municipal wastes facilities, and chemical manufacturing plants. The contribution of non-point sources to atmospheric Hg levels in urban atmosphere have not been studied extensively, but a recent study by Rutter et a!. (2008) estimated that non-point sources in an urban area contributed
~67%

of the measured GEM levels in Milwaukee. But the type of non-point sources within

urban areas have not yet been identified and reported in emissions inventory. Lynam and Keeler's study (2006) inferred a portion of the Hg species levels measured in Detroit to vehicular emissions from nearby highways, which are also non-point sources. Natural surface emissions were reported to be affecting the TGM levels in Reno, Nevada because of the strong relationship between TGM, solar irradiance and temperature in the morning and between RGM and 0 3 in the afternoon (Stamenkovic et aL 2007). RGM levels at night in Detroit have been attributed to the transport of oxidizing air masses from industrial areas and urban centers in Ohio (Lynam and Keeler, 2005), which led to the oxidation of GEM to RGM . These studies illustrate the significant long-tenn impacts of local and regional emission sources on atmospheric mercury levels and distributions in the urban atmosphere.

While much of the literature either focused on developing mercury emissions inventory or monitoring mercury levels in the environment, only recently have there been studies, such as those mentioned in the previous paragraph, to characterize and locate the types of sources contributing to the mercury levels at a particular sampling site. The study of urban areas is essential because higher Hg concentrations have been reported, but are the sources of Hg coming from local/regional point sources or from the urban area itself? Non-point, urban sources have not been identified in current emissions inventory due to limited research, but the presence of large human population and urban infrastructure could be adding to the global atmospheric mercury budget. In addition to source identification, some studies are attempting to quantify the proportion of mercury that each type of emission source contributes to the mercury levels measured at the sampling site. The results from source-receptor (or source apportionment) studies can be used to improve air quality models attempting to predict mercury levels downwind from known sources, and also have important engineering and environmental law and policy implications because of its potential to identify industries and/or companies in need of mercury emission controls and pollution prevention strategies. These measures are necessary to exceed the Canada-Wide Standards that were introduced to cap mercury emissions from base metal production, wastes incineration, and recently for coal-fired electric power generation facilities, which combine accounted for Canada (CCME, 2000).

2. Site Description and Data Analysis Methods
2.1 Location of Sampling Site and Sources of Hg

Mercury species concentrations were measured between December 2003 and November 2004 using an automated mercury speciation system (Tekran Inc ., Toronto) that was situated on the rooftop of the Kerr Hall Building at Ryerson University (43 0 39' 33.90"N , 79 0 22 ' 45.60" W, see Figure 2.1). The Hg sampling site is located in the downtown Toronto, an urban centre with a population of 2.5 million (City of Toronto, 2006; Statistics Canada, 2006), and surrounded by a residential high-rise in the northwest direction and commercial and office buildings in the southwest direction. Stationary sources of Hg reported by the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) (Environment Canada, 2004c) include sewage treatment plants, metal production facilities , coal utilities, cement and concrete production facilities , and chemical manufacturing plants. Table 2.1 is a list of the top five mercury-emitting facilities in Ontario in 2004 based on emissions data from NPRI (Environment Canada, 2004c). The stationary sources within southern Ontario are located east of Toronto and in Whitby , Mississauga, Hamilton, Nanticoke, London, and Sarnia. Figure 2. 1 is a map of Ontario and the locations of the Hg sampling site and various stationary sources of Hg .

2.2 Hg Speciation Data
Hg species concentrations were obtained from an Hg speciation study conducted in downtown Toronto (Master's Thesis by Xinjie Song, 200S). OEM (elemental Hg), PHg<2.S (particulate Hg with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.S microns) and ROM (reactive gaseous Hg) concentrations were reported every other hour because of the I-hour sampling and I-hour desorption/analysis cycle. The OEM concentration in one hour was an average of the 12 OEM concentrations measured every S minutes in that hour. PHg<2.S and ROM concentrations were calculated by summing the 4 PHg<2.S concentrations and 3 ROM concentrations during the desorption hour.

2.3 Air Pollutants and Meteorological Data
Hourly CO , NO , N0 2, NO x. PM 2s , 0 3 , and S02 criteria air pollutant concentrations for the December 2003 to November 2004 period were obtained from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment's Air Quality website (2004). The air pollutant monitors, owned and operated by the Ontario MOE, are located approximately 1 km northwest of the Hg speciation system at a height of 10 m (43 0 39'SI"N. 79 0 23' l4" W) . The weather station (WeatherHawk 232 , USA) installed adjacent to the 1130 and 113S models on the rooftop of Ryerson University recorded meteorological parameters. such as wind direction, wind speed, outdoor air temperature, relative humidity , solar radiation. rainfall and barometric pressure, every minute from May to December 2004. Hourly wind direction data from the Toronto Island Airport weather station (43 0 37.8 ' N. 79 0 24 ' W) installed at a height of 76 .S m was obtained from the Environment Canada ' s National Climate Data and Information Archive (2004b) website . The air pollutant concentrations and meteorological data corresponded to the end of the Hg sampling hour.

2.4 Detailed Model Description and Applications
This section describes in detail the models and data analysis methods used to interpret the December 2003 to November 2004 Hg species, air pollutants, meteorological , and emissions data sets. For each model/data analysis method, the data requirements, model parameters, and interpretation of the results in terms of source identification are discussed .

2.4.1 Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) Model

Description of model: The PMF 1.1 model, which was developed by USEPA 's Office of
Research and Development (2007), calculates a specific pollutant concentration from P independent factors using the following mathematical expression (Eberly, 2005; Hopke, 2003):

Previous studies used chemical species (or trace elements) identified in the factors to determine the sources of particulate matter and pollutants in precipitation. Table 2.2 is a list of various types of sources and the major gaseous pollutants and/or trace elements emitted from the source. Given the measured concentrations of each pollutant species. the PMF model estimates the values of gik and/iy while trying to minimize the objective function, Q. which accounts for the uncertainties of the pollutant species.

Model inputs:
(I) An Excel spreadsheet file containing all the variables or in this analysis, non-missing Hg

species and air pollutants concentrations. The model does not run if there is missing data (i.e .. data that was not available). PHg<2.5 and RGM concentrations that were below the average detection limit of 4 pg/m3 were not included in the model. The number of measurements that were missing or below detection limit was 566. The total number of concentrations for each pollutant that were inputted into the models was 3216. (2) A separate Excel spreadsheet file containing uncertainty for each Hg species/air pollutant concentrations or a file containing the method detection limit and percent uncertainties for each pollutant. In the latter case, the method detection limit and percent uncertainties for each pollutant are used in an equation to determine the uncertainties of the concentrations.

Model parameters:
(I) Signal-to-noise ratio. After inputting the data files, the model displays a Species

Categorization menu, which allows the analyst to down-weight or remove variables (e .g., air

17

pollutants) that have a small signal-to-noise ratio. The signal to noise ratio is dependent on the pollutant concentration relative to the uncertainties provided by the analyst. Down weighting reduces the variables influence on the model results . According to Paatero and Hopke (2003), a variable with a signal-to-noise ratio between 0.2 and 2 is defined as a "weak" variable and a variable with a ratio less than 0.2 is categorized as a " bad" variable. Weak variables are downweighted in the model , while bad variables are removed . Based on these guidelines, none of the Hg species or air pollutants from the data set was down-weighted or removed. (2) Num ber of factors. The number of factors , which ultimately represents the number of distinct sources, was varied during preliminary tests to assess the number of factors required to provide a good fit of the measured concentrations. This is determined by examining the R2 value between the model-predicted and measured concentrations for each pollutant, which is displayed in one of the model's output files. The six-factor solution was selected in the final model. The number of factors that the user can enter ranges from 3 to 18. But the number of factors chosen should be less than the number of variables. (3) Number of random starting points. The number of random starting points can be entered to determine which model-run will yield the lowest object function , Q. or the sum of least squares. Eight random starting points were chosen for the analysis. The PMF 1.1 model guide (Eberly , 2005) recommended at least five random starting points to ensure that the model achieves the lowest Q value . At eight random starting points, the Q values for each of the runs have reached a similar Q value. which is an indication that the lowest Q value has been achieved (Eberly, 2005). Increasing the number of random starting points would increase the model run time.

18

(4) Random seed. The analyst can choose to specify the seed used in random number generation or have randomly generated seeds. In the analysis, the randomly generated seed was selected. The random seed is the default setting, but the analyst could specify a seed so that another analyst can run the model in the exact same way using the same data set for the purpose of comparison. But if a seed were specified , the analyst would have to verify that other seeds would lead to the same model results.

Model outputs:
After running the model , the sum of least squares, Q, is shown for each of the eight random seeds. The random seed that minimizes the Q value was selected as the final model results. The PMF model outputs include:

(1) A file containing the factor profile or the chemical species concentrations for the factors (fkj
from Equation (1), which are then used to characterize the source. The chemical species concentrations in the factors have the same units as the measured concentrations. (2) A file containing the source contributions to the receptor concentrations (gik from Equation

(1» for every measurement. The source contributions provide information about the fraction
each source is contributing to the measured Hg levels. (3) A file containing the residual s or the difference between the model-predicted (xI) from Equation (I») and measured concentrations for each of the chemical species.

Model interpretation:
The chemical species concentrations for each factor were used to calculate N0 2/Hg,

PM 25 /Hg and S02/Hg . Hg refers to total mercury , which includes GEM. PHg<2.S and RGM, in
units of ng/m
3 .

N0 2 and S02 concentrations originally in units of parts per billion (ppb) were

19

converted to f..lg/m3 using the Ideal Gas equation in order to keep the units of the ratios consistent (f..lg of pollutant/ng of Hg) (refer to sample calculations in the Appendix). Using emissions data from the National Pollutant Release Inventory , the N0 2/Hg, PM 2S /Hg and S02/Hg for stationary sources in Ontario (emitting more than 10 kg ofHg in air in 2004) were determined. The emissions data have units of tons for criteria air pollutants (N0 2 , PM 25 , and S02) and kg for Hg emissions, so that the ratios of the source would be in units of tons of pollutant/kg of Hg. The range of the N0 2/Hg, PM 2S /Hg and S02/Hg for the sources was compared with those calculated from the PMF model results to relate the factors to the Hg sources in Ontario. A potential issue of using the PMF model for gaseous pollutants is that there are an insufficient number of gaseous pollutants being measured to easily characterize the sources, unlike the large number of chemical species that can be measured from particulate matter or precipitation samples. Although the factor profiles can identify the types of Hg sources that might be related to the measured Hg concentrations, it does not provide information about how much mercury each source is contributing to the measured Hg concentrations. To estimate the average Hg specie concentration from the
klh

factor, the product of the Hg specie concentrations of the

klh

factor and

the source contributions (the product is equivalent tofkj gik from Eq uation (I)) are calculated and then averaged for the entire year (see sample calculations in the Appendix). Summing the model-predicted Hg specie concentrations from all the factors would yield the overall modelp

predicted Hg specie concentration, which is equivalent to Equation (1).

Hg indicates that the source is strongly contributing to the Hg level s at the receptor site.

20

The PMF model can be evaluated by plotting the model-predicted concentrations against the measured concentrations and then obtaining the coefficient of determination, R2. or by examining the residuals (the difference between model-predicted and measured concentrations).

2.4.2 Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

Description of model: PCA is used to group a large set of related variables (e.g. , measured air
pollutant concentrations) into a smaller set of factors while maximizing as much of the variance in the variables as possible (Garson. 2008; Pallant, 2005). Similar to the PMF model , the factor consists of some of the measured air pollutants from the data set. which can be used to identify the types of sources. Unlike in the PMF model, PCA does not provide information about the percent contributions of each source to the receptor concentrations, or in other words, the impacts of the sources on the Hg concentrations at the sampling location. PCA also does not permit the data analyst to down-weight individual data points containing large uncertainties on the model. Large factor loadings (or corre lation coefficients) between a factor and an air pollutant indicate that the pollutant is a major component of the factor. Table 2.2. which lists the major pollutants and trace chemical species emitted from various types ofHg sources, can be used to determine which source a factor may represent. PCA can be employed using statistical software, such as SPSS .

Model inputs:
(1) An Excel spreadsheet file containing all the variables (e .g., Hg species and air pollutants
concentrations). PCA can be performed even if the data set contains missing data . However, to be consistent with the PMF model inputs, the data set without missing values and without PHg<2.5 and RGM concentrations below the average detection limit of 4 pg/m3 was used in PCA. The total number of measurements for each pollutant that were inputted into the model was 3216.

22

Model parameters:

(l) Factor Analysis Suitability: To assess if the data set is suitable for PCA, SPSS performs
the following statistical tests and the analyst decides whether factor analysis should be used for the data set. The first test is the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy. Tabachnick and Fidell (2001) suggested that a KMO
va lu ~

greater than 0.6 indicates a good

factor analysis. The second test is the Bartlett' s Test of Sphericity. The significance level of Bartlett's Test of Sphericity is p <0.05. In the analysis, the data set met both criteria. (2) Number of factors: Kaiser' s criterion, Scree Test and Parallel Analysis were used to determine which factors generated by the PCA model should be retained . According to Pallant (2005), Kaiser' s criterion requires an eigenvalue > 1 to retain the factor. The number of factors to retain based on the Scree Test is determined by examining where the shape of the Scree plot changes to form an elbow (Pallant, 2005). The components on or before the bend are retained . Parallel Analysis generates average eigenvalues from randomly generated samples by specifYing the number of variables and measurements. These average eigenvalues were generated from a computer software developed by Marley Watkins (2000). If the eigenvalue from PCA is larger than the eigenvalue generated from Parallel Analysis. then the factor is retained ; otherwise, the factor is rejected (Pallant, 2005). The final PCA result was a four-factor model after carrying out the assessment. However, three-factor and five-factor solutions were also examined to assess whether these models could increase the percent variance of the data set explained and generate distinctively different factors. (3) Type of factor rotation: The retained factors are then rotated using Varimax or Oblimin rotation techniques to interpret the results of the analysi s. Varimax rotation was used in the

23

analysis because the sources are assumed to be independent. However, oblimin rotation was also attempted to verify that the factors/components are not strongly correlated with each other.

Model outputs:
(l) A table illustrating the percent variance of the data explained by each of the four rotated
components. (2) A table illustrating the factor/component loadings, which are the correlation coefficients between the variables in the data set and the factors/components extracted. The component loadings will be used to characterize the sources. The factor loadings can be positive or negative, unlike the PMF model that limits the solution to non-negative values (Eberly , 2005). This is relevant to source identification because normally we are interested in a positive relationship between the factor and variables (e.g. , Hg species and/or air pollutants).

Model interpretation: By examining the loadings on each of the variables in each factor/component. the sources can be identified. A factor with strong OEM and N0 2 or NO x loadings indicate combustion sources, such as vehicle combustion and/or industrial processes (Lynam and Keeler, 2006). Coal combustion is likely a factor if there are strong ROM and S02 loadings (Lynam and Keeler. 2006). ROM and 0 3 loadings are indicative of photochemical processes converting OEM to ROM (Kim and Kim , 2001 ; Lynam and Keeler, 2005.2006). The percent variance of the data explained by each factor is reported to evaluate how well the model represents the measured Hg data set. The percent variance explained by each factor is calculated by summing the factor loadings of all the air pollutants and then dividing by the

24

number of air pollutants used in PCA. A high percent variance explained by a factor suggests that it represents the Hg data set well.

2.4.3 Back Trajectory Modeling

Description of model: The PMF and PCA models discussed so far require only the observed
measurements and emissions data to identify the types of sources affecting the receptor site. These statistical models have not incorporated the effects of meteorological conditions on the transport of air pollutants from the source to receptor. Trajectory models use meteorological data that has been generated from other models, which use data obtained from weather monitoring stations on land and water, rawinsonde (device used in weather balloons to measure wind direction and speed), wind profilers, and satellites (Gebhart, 2005). The 3 to 4 dimension meteorological data is spatially interpolated onto a model grid and provided at regular time intervals before being inputted into trajectory models. To investigate whether the meteorological conditions during elevated GEM events favored the transport ofHg from the regional sources to the sampling site in Toronto, 48-hour back trajectories corresponding to the period of the elevated Hg events were generated using the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory web-based HYSPLIT (HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model (Draxler and Rolph, 2003 ; Rolph, 2003). The HYSPLIT model simulates that transport of an air parcel by wind and estimates the position of the parcel using velocity vectors that have been spatially and temporally interpolated onto a grid (Draxler and Rolph, 2003; Rolph, 2003). The trajectory represents the path of a single particle from the time of its initial release and does not account for particle dispersion (Draxler and Rolph, 2003; Rolph, 2003). Back trajectory modeling was applied to

25

only the elevated Hg events (GEM concentration > 20 ng/m\ There were a total of eight elevated Hg events throughout the entire monitoring campaign.

Model inputs:

(l) Meteorological Data: The EDAS (Eta Data Assimilation System) archived meteorological
data, developed by the National Weather Service' s National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), were selected as the meteorological input to the model. The meteorological data has been interpolated onto a 40 km grid that spans the United States and Canada. The vertical resolution covers 26 pressure surfaces from 1000 hPa (mbar) to 50 hPa. The meteorological data is provided every 3 hours. The EDAS 40 km meteorological data was chosen because it was the highest spatial resolution data set available on the web version of HYSPLIT. (2) Trajectory starting location: The latitude and longitude coordinates of the Hg sampling site were entered, i.e. 43° 39' 33.90"N, 79° 22 ' 4S.60" W. to represent the starting location of the trajectory. (3) Date of archived meteorological data: The archived meteorological data was stored as 15day files. Each month contains two data files: one for the first half of the month and the other for the second half. The data file was selected based on the date of the elevated GEM event.

Model parameters:
(1) Trajectory direction: Either forward or backward trajectories can be selected. For source

identification studies. backward trajectories were chosen.

26

(2) Vertical motion: The model allows the choice of model vertical velocity, isobaric (trajectory follows a constant pressure surface) or isentropic (trajectory follows a constant potential temperature surface) to calculate vertical motion. Model vertical velocity means that the model ' s vertical velocity fields are used in the calculation and was recommended for most applications. (3) Start time: The time in UTe (universal time, coordinated) corresponding to the end of the elevated GEM episode was entered. The HYSPLIT model provides a table to convert between Eastern Standard Time and UTe. (4) Total run time: This is the time duration of the trajectory. 48-hour trajectories were selected for all the elevated GEM episodes. (5) Trajectory starting heights: Trajectory starting heights of 15 m, 50 m and 500 m were chosen to represent the height of the sampling inlet, buildings in the downtown core, and above the urban structure canopy , respectively. Trajectories were generated at three different heights because the model is sensitive to starting heights, which can yield very different trajectory paths (Gebhart et aI., 2005).

Model outputs:
(1) GIS shapefile (a file format used specifically in Geographic Information Systems software)

that can be imported into ArcView GIS software to plot maps illustrating the sources, Hg sampling site, and back trajectories corresponding to each elevated GEM event.

Model interpretation:
The trajectory paths indicate whether an air parcel had passed through sources that emit Hg during the elevated GEM episodes. The model provides information about the types and location of the Hg sources contributing to the elevated GEM concentrations at the receptor site.

27

One of the important considerations in using back trajectory modeling is that the resolution of the meteorological data should reflect the scale of the study, e.g. , global , national, regional , local and/or urban scale, because a large portion of the model uncertainties have been attributed to the input meteorological data (Gebhart et aI., 2005 ; Schichtel and Wishinski , 1996). Back trajectories might not reflect the observed meteorological conditions because of the spatial and temporal interpolation of the meteorological parameters (Draxler and Rolph, 2003; Rolph, 2003) . Recent modeling studies conducted over urban areas found that finer resolution meteorological data is necessary to simulate pollutant transport in an urban atmosphere and resolve local sources (Arain et aI. , 2007). However, the task of generating higher resolution data is currently tec1mically and computationally demanding (Stein et aI. , 2007 ; Dr. L. Zhang, 2007, personal communication).

2.4.4 Ratio Analysis

Description of analysis: Ratio analysis is a comparison of the N0 2/Hg, PM2S /Hg and S02/Hg
between Hg sources and those measured at the sampling location to identify the types of sources affecting a receptor site. RGM /PHg<2.5 and wind direction data during elevated Hg events have also been analyzed to assess whether regional sources could be affecting the Hg levels at the sampling location , since a decreasing RGM/PHg<2.5 indicates an aging mercury plume. Previously, N0 2/Hg, PM 2S /Hg and S02/Hg were used in the PMF model results to relate the factors and sources.

Data required:
(I) Hg species and air pollutant concentrations during the elevated GEM events (GEM concentration > 20 ng/m 3) . N0 2 and S02 concentrations in units of parts per billion (ppb) were

28

converted to Ilg/m 3 using the Ideal Gas equation at standard temperature and pressure (refer to sample calculations in the Appendix). The unit conversions were necessary because the units of the N02/Hg, PM 2S /Hg and S02/Hg at the sampling site must be Ilg of air pollutant/ng of total Hg in order to compare with the source ratios, which will be in units of tons of air pollutants/kg of total Hg . Total Hg concentration is the summation of elemental Hg (GEM) , particulate Hg (PHg<2.5) and reactive gaseous Hg (RGM) concentrations. (2) Wind direction data measured at Ryerson University and Toronto Island Airport corresponding to the time of the elevated GEM events. Wind directions observed at Ryerson University would likely be affected by buildings and commercial area located south/southwest of the sampling site. Thus, the wind direction data from the Toronto Island Airport station (located south/southwest of the sampling site in Lake Ontario) can be used to confirm the southwest trajectory paths generated from the HYSPLIT model. (3) 2004 emissions data (Hg, N0 2, PM 2S , and S02) from stationary Hg sources in Ontario. In the NPRL Hg emissions into the atmosphere were reported in kilograms. while N02, PM2S, and S02 emissions were reported in tons.

Interpretation of results:
Similar N0 2/Hg. PM25/Hg and S02/Hg between a source and those measured at the sampling location indicate that the source is affecting the sampling site. Sources with atmospheric pollutant ratios much larger than the receptor/sampling site are unlikely to be contributing to the sampling site because of the large amount of deposition that would have to occur (Manolopoulos et aL 2007b). Decreasing RGM/PHg<2.5 (indicates gas partitioning processes) from a constant

29

wind direction suggests that a regional source located in that wind direction is potentially contributing to the Hg levels at the sampling site (Lynam and Keeler, 2005).

2.4.5 Correlation Analysis

Description of analysis: Correlation analysis is often performed on a set of variables to
determine the strength of the relationship between two observed variables and whether the relationship is positive or negative. This is useful for source identification because the correlation between Hg species and criteria air pollutants, which are commonly emitted from combustion or industrial sources, can be used to infer types of sources. Recent literature and atmospheric Hg models have used correlation analysis between Hg species and NO x , 0 3 and S02 as a method to identify sources of RGM (reactive gaseous mercury) (Han et aI. , 2004; Kim and Kim , 2001; Lynam and Keeler, 2005). RGM can be emitted into the atmosphere directly as well as indirectly through the oxidation of GEM (elemental mercury) by oxidants, such as 0 3, halogens, and hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere (Lindberg and Stratton, 1998). Correlation analysis will be conducted using statistical software, such as SPSS. Pearson r correlation analysis with a significance level of p <0.05 was chosen.

Data required:
(1) Hg species and air pollutants concentrations segregated into winter, spring, summer, and fall. The seasonal analysis was necessary because ozone levels are also affected by meteorological parameters. such as solar radiation and temperature (Kim and Kim, 2001).
(2) Hg species and air pollutants concentrations corresponding to the time of the eight elevated

GEM episodes (GEM concentration > 20 ng/m\

30

Interpretation of results:

Correlations between Hg, CO and NO x have been used to relate mercury levels at the sampling site to industrial or vehicular combustion sources (Lynam and Keeler, 2006); RGM-S0 2 correlations have been used to identify coal combustion (Han et aI. , 2004), and RGM-0 3 correlations have been examined to identify the photochemical reactions converting GEM to RGM (Han et aI. , 2004; Lindberg and Stratton, 1998; Lynam and Keeler, 2005 ; Sillman et aI. , 2007) . Positive correlations between model-predicted GEM and RGM indicate direct emissions of RGM, whereas anti-correlations indicate that RGM is indirectly produced from the oxidation of GEM (Sillman et aI. , 2007).

3. Results and Discussion
3.1 PMF Model Results
The PMF model results, shown in Table 3.1 , illustrated that factors 4, 5 and 6 contribute to most of the Hg measured at the sampling site, and factors 1, 2 and 3 combined contribute to less than 12% of the measured GEM, PHg<2.5 or RGM concentrations. Using the factor profiles and emissions data in 2004 from the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) (Environment Canada, 2004c), air pollutant to Hg ratios (e.g ., N0 2/Hg, PM 25 /Hg and S02/Hg) were calculated for the model factors and sources (see Tables 3.1 and 3.2). The Hg in the ratios refers to the sum of the atmospheric mercury species. The NPRI only reports criteria air pollutant emissions for stationary sources, and our analysis have focused only on those sources in Ontario that emitted more than 10 kg of Hg in 2004. Air pollutants to Hg ratios for the model factors that are within the range of the source ratios indicate that the factor and source are related . The following section describes what each of the factors could represent. Based on the factor profiles in Table 3.1 , factor 4 is likely related to industrial sources and photochemical processes because the profile contains some nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide and large amounts of ozone. Sunlight breaks down nitrogen dioxide into nitrogen oxide and a free oxygen atom , which can react with oxygen to form tropospheric ozone. The emission of other air pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds, could prevent the natural destruction of tropospheric ozone resulting in a build up of ozone. Factor 4 might be associated with industrial sources, such as chemical products manufacturing and primary metal production , because of the similar N0 2/Hg and S02/Hg ratios between the factor and sources (see Table 3.] and 3.2). However, there is large variation in the air pollutants to Hg ratios for primary metal production facilities in Ontario. and the nearest facility is located 50-60 km from the sampling

site (e.g., in Whitby or Hamilton - see Figure 2.1) . The closest chemical manufacturing plant is about 300 Ian from the sampling site (e.g., in Samia) and not a major emitter ofHg (see Table 2.1), but the use of chemical-manufactured products in an urban city is potentially a source ofHg (Hagreen and Lourie, 2004). Factor 4 contributes 4.3% GEM , 0.8% PHg<2.S and 10.9% RGM.

Factor 5 has a profile with a high GEM concentration, but relatively low PHg<2.5 , RGM and other criteria air pollutant concentrations. Hence, the N0 2/Hg and PM 2S /Hg ratios for factor 5 are very small and are comparable to the ratios found in sewage treatment facilities, which are located 20-30 km from the sampling site (e.g ., in Toronto east, Pickering, Mississauga). This factor contributes 84 .0% GEM , 20.3% PHg<2.5 and 24.] % RGM. Factor 6 contains PHg<2.5 , RGM and trace amounts of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, and contributes to most of the PHg<2.5 and RGM , 78 .] % and 55 .0%, respectively. The N0 2/Hg and S02/Hg ratios of factor 6 are within the range of the ratios for chemical products and primary metal production sources. This is similar to factor 4, but without the influence of photochemical processes involving ozone. Factors 1 and 2. which have minor contributions to the measured Hg levels. might belong to primary metal production as well based on similar N02/Hg and S02/Hg ratios between the factors and sources. Factor 3 does not appear to be associated with the stationary sources in Ontario because of the relatively large PM2S/Hg ratio . Our analysis found that cement and concrete production and fossil fuel power generation (i .e .. coal combustion) were like ly not

35

contributing to the Hg species concentrations in Toronto, since both the N0 2/Hg and S02/Hg were outside the range of the ratios of these sources. As shown in Table 3.1 , sewage treatment contributed - 84% of the GEM levels, while metals and chemical production contributed - 16% of the GEM levels. Sewage treatment contributed - 20% of the PHg<2.5 levels, and metals and chemical production contributed - 80% of the PHg<2.5 levels. Sewage treatment contributed - 24% of the RGM levels, and metals and chemical production contributed - 76% of the RGM levels.

3.1.1 Evaluation of PMF Model
The model-predicted Hg species concentrations from all factors, calculated using the PMF model equation (Equation (I)) discussed in section 2.4.1. provided a good fit of the measured concentrations of GEM and PHg<2.5 as evident by the large R2 values shown in Figure 3.1 (a) and (b). The R2 values were I and 0.97, respectively . However, the PMF model only provided a moderate fit of the measured RGM concentrations. since the R2 value was 0.45 (see Figure 3.1 (c)). This might because the PMF model does not attempt to over fit the extreme data points and assumes that the chemical species do not undergo transformation between the source and receptor site. During preliminary model test runs, the number of factors was varied to achieve a larger R2 value for the three Hg species. There was a significant improvement in the coefficient of determination when the number of factors was increased from 4 to 6, but insignificant improvements from a 6 to 7-factor solution. The plot of the residuals for GEM , PHg<2.5 and RGM (see Figure 3.1 (d) - (f)) illustrate that the model fits were acceptable. The residuals plot appeared random for all three Hg species, and only 0.75%, 0.12% and 1.52% of the predicted GEM , PHg<2.5 and RGM concentrations were beyond three times the standard deviation of the residuals.

3.1.2 PMF Model Results from Literature
The PMF model was used in many studies for identifying and quantifying the sources that contributed to particulate matter and wet deposition in the environment. PM2 .5 measured in St. Louis, Missouri was affected by local point sources. such as zinc smelting, copper production, steel mills and lead smelting (Lee and Hopke. 2006), which contributed 16-18% of the PM 25 . Regional sources located in Ohio, Iowa and Kansas that contained secondary sulfate and nitrate contributed 51-60% of the measured PM 2.S· and vehicular emissions contributed 1726% of the measured PM 2.5. Long-range transport of dust from Africa also contributed to 3% of the measured PM 2.5 . The study by Lee and Hopke (2006) analyzed 26 elements in the particulate matter samples and thus, was able to generate distinct factor profiles that can better characterize the types of sources. The PMF model was able to explain about 90% of the variance in the measured PM 25 data . The study by Keeler et al. (2006) used PMF to apportion sources of Hg wet deposition in Steubenville, Ohio. The site was surrounded by ] 7 coal-fired utility boilers within a 100 km radius of the sampling site. Six sources were identified, which included iron/steel production, oil and incineration, crustal , coal combustion, phosphorous and molybdenum . Not surprisingly, coal combustion contributed 73% of the Hg wet deposition at the sampling site, while 6% and 2% were apportioned to iron/steel production and phosphorus emitting sources. The coefficient of determination was 0.85 for the model predicted Hg concentrations versus measured Hg concentrations in wet deposition. The study by Lee et al. (2003) is the most relevant to the current analysis because the sampling site was also located in downtown Toronto . Using the PMF model , the study apportioned most of the PM 25 to four major sources. The source contributions were 26% for coal combustion and secondary sulfate, 36% for secondary nitrate (from power plants and transportation), 15% for secondary organic

38

aerosols (from biomass burning in the US), and 10% for vehicle emissions. The model identified other factors that might be related to sources, such as road salt, coal/oil combustion, industrial (e.g. , steel production, mining, metal processing, smelters and incineration), and construction, but source contributions were smaller. The PMF model was able to explain 97% of the variance in the measured PM 25 data in Toronto. The studies in St. Louis, Steubenville, and Toronto apportioned particulate matter to local coal combustion and industrial sources, whereas the PMF model did not apportioned Hg in Toronto to coal combustion. The PMF model results from this study and Lee et a1. (2003) are different because of the different pollutants being studied and different chemical species that were used to characterize the coal combustion factor. The coal combustion factor in the study by Lee et al. (2003) consisted of secondary pollutants, such as sulfate (S042-), ammonium (NH/ ) and phosphate (POl -), and selenium (Se), which is an element also commonly found in metal ores, whereas S02 was used to characterize coal combustion in this study.

3.2 PCA Results The correlation coefficients or factor loadings between the air pollutants and each factor are tabulated in Table 3.3. Four unique factors were extracted from PCA. The factors generated from PCA contain some of the variables in the data set and are used to characterize the sources, similar to the PMF model factors. Air pollutants that are strongly related to the factor have large correlation coefficients (i.e. greater than 0.50). PCA results indicated that the Hg species have a moderate to weak relationship with factors 1, 3 and 4 and a strong relationship with factor 2. Based on the factor loadings in Table 3.3 , factor 1 might be related to combustion sources. such as vehicles and/or industrial processes. because of the high factor loadings for the nitrogen

39

oxides species (NO, N0 2 and NO x). Factor 2 contains high factor loadings for Hg species, but no factor loadings for the criteria air pollutants except for PM 2.5. Thus, factor 2 is not well defined and also might not be related to combustion sources.

Factor 3 has a weak , negative factor loading for OEM and a moderate, positive factor loading for ROM . This factor is also strongly related to 0 3 and PM 25 and weakly related to NO and S02. This suggests that factor 3 is associated with photochemical and combustion processes. Photochemical processes and combustion are related because the byproducts from combustion can lead to the formation of secondary pollutants, such as 0 3 . 0 3 can oxidize OEM to form ROM, which might explain the negative and positive factor loadings for these two species. Factor 4 is also representative of many types of combustion sources (e .g., from vehicles, industrial processes, fossil fue ls, etc .) because it contains weak factor loadings for ROM , N02 and PM 2.5 and strong loadings for S02.

40

Comparison of the factor descriptions from PCA with the emissions data reported by facilities suggests that industrial processes from chemical product manufacturing and sewage treatment, and combustion processes from primary metals production are likely affecting the Hg levels in Toronto. Vehicular combustion is also a potential source of Hg mainly because of the presence of nitrogen oxides in vehicular exhaust and the close proximity of the sampling site to roads and highways in downtown Toronto. As previously discussed , the factor profiles are not unique enough to differentiate between the different types of combustion processes. The factor loadings for RGM and S02 in this study do not agree with those identified as coal combustion in the studies by Liu et al. (2007) and Lynam and Keeler (2006). In these studies, the coal combustion factor loadings for RGM and S02 were 0.79-0.86 and 0.72-0.73, respectively. Thus, coal combustion is likely not a source of Hg in Toronto. This finding is also consistent with PMF model results. The description of factor 2 from PCA is not related to any of the Hg sources reported on NPRI, but factor 2 does represent a significant source because it explains - 22% of the variance in the data set and has high factor loadings for all the Hg species. Further investigation into this source is required . However, we speculate that the unidentified Hg source might be related to non-point, urban sources (e .g., Street pavement dust, roofs. windows and soils has been reported by Eckley and Branfireun (2008) as sources ofHg emissions in Toronto and Austin. Texas; Hagreen and Lourie (2004) estimated that fluorescent lamps and thermometers commonly found in buildings directly release - 1.100 kg of Hg/year in Canada; fugitive (non-duct/stack) Hg emissions from a Hg cell chlor-alkali building. estimated at - 500 g of Hg/day. have also been reported by Southworth et al. (2004)) because Hg concentrations in urban airshed are typically higher than those in rural airshed. and the Toronto site is not closely surrounded by major point

41

sources as shown in Figure 2.1. Within 1OO-Ian of the sampling site in Toronto, the major point sources (i.e. top 5 emitters of Hg in Ontario) include two metals production plants located in Whitby and Hamilton
(~60

Ian away) and the Lakeview power plant located in Mississauga

(~ 17

km away), which was still in operation in 2004. The number of major point sources within 100-

km of the sampling site in Toronto is significantly less than those within the same distance from
the sampling sites in Detroit, Steubenville, and Milwaukee. The Detroit site was affected by 6 coal utilities, 4 medical wastes, 4 municipal wastes, 13 steel, and 1 other metals facility within 30-km of the sampling site (Lynam and Keeler, 2005). The Steubenville, Ohio site was surrounded by 17 coal-fired utilities within 1OO-km of the sampling site (Keeler et aI., 2006). The Milwaukee, Wisconsin site was enclosed by 5 coal utilities, 1 steel mill/blast fumace, and 1 chemical manufacturing plant within 100-km of the sampling site (Rutter et aI., 2008).

3.2.1 Evaluation of peA
The factors generated from PCA are suppose to be representative of the Hg species and criteria air pollutants data set, and they are evaluated using percent variance explained or the overall factor R2. The percent variance explained for each factor (see Table 3.3) is calculated by summing the factor loadings of all the air pollutants for each factor and then dividing by the number of air pollutants used in PCA. The total percent variance explained by the four factors is about 80%. About 54% of the variance of the measured data is attributed to combustion processes, ~ 14% of the variance is explained by a factor related to both combustion and photochemical processes involving ozone, while ~22% is associated with source(s) that lacks a source profile.

42

3.2.2 PCA Results from Literature
Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been used for developing source-receptor relationships for Hg. Factor analysis was applied to total gaseous mercury (TGM) concentrations (i.e., sum of GEM and RGM concentrations), other air pollutants and meteorological variables that were measured in Seoul, Korea (Kim and Kim, 2001). PCA results on the fall daytime data set generated two factors. The first factor. which explained 57% of the variance in the data, contained Hg and criteria air pollutants (CH 4, CO, NO x and S02), and the second factor, which explained 16% of the variance in the data, consisted of Hg, temperature, relative humidity and ozone. Unlike the fall daytime data set, the fall nighttime and summer daytime and nighttime data sets each generated a factor composed of criteria air pollutants that explained 40-57% of the variance in the data set. and two other factors containing meteorological variables. The data analysis indicated that the factors affecting daytime Hg levels are different between summer and fall. The study of potential sources affecting the Hg species levels and distribution during four separate sampling campaigns (July and September 2000 , July 200 1, Jul y 2002) in Detroit was also conducted using PCA (Lynam and Keeler, 2006) . Lynam and Keeler (2006) found that GEM was associated with a factor containing CO and NO x likely emitted from vehicles on nearby highways. This factor explained 17% of the variance in the data set. RGM was linked to a photochemi stry factor due to high factor loadings for RGM and 0 3 and a coal combustion factor, which had high factor loadings for both RGM and S02. The coal combustion factor was expected because several coal-fired facilities were located near the sampling site. The percent variance explained was 33% for the photochemistry factor and 25% for the coal combustion factor. PCA was performed on the annual Hg species concentrations measured in 2003 at the same sampling location by Liu et al. (2007). The factors identified in the study by

43

Liu et a1. (2007) were related to photochemical processes involving 0 3, local coal combustion sources and transport of polluted regional air masses, and seasonal meteorological conditions. The data analysis ofTGM collected from 11 CAMNet (Canadian Atmospheric Mercury Measurement Network) sites over a 1O-year period (1995-2005) was characterized by PCA (Temme et aI. , 2007). Using PCA, Temme et a1. (2007) identified two factors that combined explained 50% of the variance in the data set. These factors were related to seasonal variability in TGM concentrations (e.g. higher TGM concentrations in the winter and spring compared to summer and fall at most CAMNet sites) and changes to local natural or anthropogenic sources that have led to significant decreases in TGM concentrations in certain rural CAMNet sites.

3.3 Data Limitations

The NPRI was useful for identifying the types of stationary sources that were impacting the Hg concentrations at the sampling site; however, it did not include the potential impacts that mobile sources, such as vehicles, can have on Hg levels in the urban environment. This is relevant to the sampling site because it was situated on a 3-story building that is adjacent to streets with a major highway nearby . PCA identified combustion sources as a potential contributor to Hg in Toronto ; however. the analysis could not differentiate between vehicular sources or industrial processes. Gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles can be identified based on chemical species/trace element profiles (Landis et al.. 2007 and references in Table 2.2), but only criteria air pollutant concentrations were available from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. The inventory also lacks emissions data on local sources within an urban area that could be impacting the Hg levels at the sampling site. Non-point. urban sources are potentially contributing to the Hg levels at the sampling site because previous studies have reported higher Hg concentrations in urban than rural environments (Rutter et al., 2008). The lack of

44

atmospheric Hg speciation data (i.e., GEM, PHg<2.5 and RGM concentrations) emitted from the sources also poses a challenge to identify sources of Hg. Hg speciation data from emissions inventory is relevant for source identification because the different physical and chemical properties of Hg species affect their fate and transport. For example, since RGM have a shorter average atmospheric residence time compared to GEM, sources that emit RGM (e.g. , coal combustion, Hg cell chlor-alkali plant) would likely affect areas that are close to the source. Landis et al. (2004) found that the percentage of RGM to GEM decreases from 2.1% at a chloralkali plant to l.5% and l.3% at distances of350 m and 800 m away, which is evidence of the rapid deposition ofRGM and its impacts on local areas. Without the source emissions data (e.g. criteria air pollutant emissions from the sources) from NPRl , the factors generated by the PMF model would not be able to identify the types of sources contributing to atmospheric Hg levels in Toronto. This is due to the lack of measurements of other chemical/trace element species (e.g. , barium, nickel , selenium, vanadium, zinc, etc.), which may be better for characterizing specific types of sources, as illustrated in source apportionment studies of precipitation and particulate matter (Brinkman et aI. , 2006; Keeler et aI. , 2006; Lee and Hopke, 2006; Lee et al.. 2003). In these studies, mass spectrometry can analyze multiple elements from a single sample, whereas the measurement of different gaseous pollutants requires separate analyzers.

45

3.4 Contributions to Elevated Hg Events 3.4.1 Analysis of Air Pollutants to Hg Species Ratios
The potential sources contributing to the eight elevated Hg events ([GEM]>20 ng/m Toronto are likely linked to chemical products, primary metal production, and/or sewage treatment because the average air pollutants to Hg ratios during the elevated Hg events and the entire study period are within the range of ratios for these sources (see Tables 3.2 and 3.4).

Cement and concrete production and coal combustion likely did not contribute to the measured elevated Hg events. The N0 2/Hg and S02/Hg from cement production are on average 43 times and 336 times higher, respectively. than the average ratios from the monitoring site. Similarly. the N0 2/Hg and S02/Hg from coal utilities are on average 18 times and 482 times higher, respectively , than the average ratios from the monitoring site. Therefore, it is unlikely for such a large amount ofN0 2 and S02 deposition to take place in order to reduce the atmospheric ratios from cement production and coal utility sources to those at the monitoring site. These sources potentially contributed to PHg<2.5 levels because of the similar PM 25 /Hg . This is further supported by a study that apportioned particulate matter levels in Toronto to a coal-fired power plant in Ontario using the PMF model (Lee et aI. , 2003).

46

Atmospheric pollutants ratios have been used in other studies to identify sources contributing to the Hg levels at the sampling site. Similar GEM/CO was reported in Asia and in Oregon, USA confirming that long-range transport of Hg from Asia was responsible for the elevated Hg levels in Oregon (Jaffe et aI. , 2005); however, the study found major discrepancies between emissions inventory data calculated from emission factors and stack measurements in Asia (Friedli et aI. , 2004; Jaffe et aI. , 2005), which can yield different ratios. Emissions inventory data are also reported as an annual average, which might be different from the emissions measured at any point in time (Manolopoulos et aI. , 2007b). A recent study by Manolopoulos et al. (2007b) found that the N0 2/Hg and S02/Hg ratios of the six coal combustion sources located 60 km away were on average two orders of magnitude larger than those at the sampling site, which indicated that those sources were likely not contributing to the measured Hg levels. The reason for this is because it is unlikely that large amounts of deposition would occur between a regional source and the sampling site (Manolopoulos et aI. , 2007b). Thus, the study attributed the Hg levels at the sampling site to sources located 5 km away. since the ratios were comparable to the sampling site. In the study by Lohman et al. (2006). the S02/Hg decreased by 2 from a power plant located
~ 160

km away to the sampling site near
~ 30

Atlanta, Georgia. In the same study, another power plant located

km away from the

sampling site had a S02/Hg 1.1 to 1.6 times higher than that of the sampling site. which illustrates that S02 losses are generally minor.

3.4.2 Back Trajectory Modeling To investigate whether the meteorological conditions during the elevated Hg events favored the transport of Hg from the regional sources to the sampling site in Toronto, 48-hour back trajectories conesponding to the period of the elevated Hg episodes were generated using

47

, !,
,
"

the HYSPLIT (HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model (Drexler and Rolph, 2003; Rolph, 2003). There were a total of eight elevated Hg events, defined as a time period where GEM concentrations were above 20 ng/m 3 , throughout the entire monitoring campaign. The elevated GEM events lasted from a few hours to 1-2 days. The back trajectories at starting heights of 15 , 50 and 500 m for each elevated Hg event are shown in Figures 3.2 to 3.7. The 48-hour back trajectories during the Jan 23 rd event (Figure 3.2) illustrates that the trajectories passed through Thunder Bay, where a fossil fuel power generation facility is located. Figure 3.3(a) shows that the trajectory paths for the three starting heights are different for the Feb 28 th event and did not appear to pass through any regional point sources. The May 25 1h event shown in Figure 3.3(b) shows that the lower starting height trajectories (15 m and 50 m) passed through point sources located in Toronto (Sewage treatment), Pickering (Sewage treatment), Whitby (Metal production), Nanticoke (Power generation), Haldimand County (Metal production) and Woodstock (Cement and concrete). Back trajectories generated for June 8 th (Figure 3.4). June 28 th (Figure 3.5) and July 19th (Figure 3.6) events appeared to pass through many point sources in southern Ontario, including a power generation facility. cement and concrete manufacturing, sewage treatment. and metal production . The June 81h trajectories extend to the state of Ohio and Indiana in the US, which contains industrial areas and populated urban centers. Back trajectories generated for the Detroit sampling site also found that the site was influenced by regional sources in Ohio and Indiana as well (Lynam and Keeler, 2005). Back trajectories during the elevated Hg event on Sept.

ill

(Figure 3.7(a» did not appear to originate from sources in Ontario. The back trajectories on Oct. 20 lh (Figure 3.7(b» passed through two sewage treatment facilities in Toronto and Pickering and a primary metals facility.

3.4.2.1 Back Trajectory Modeling Uncertainties Back trajectory modeling has been widely used to locate sources of pollutants (Lee et aI., 2003; Liu et aI., 2007; Lynam and Keeler, 2005). However, recent literature on air pollution modeling (Arain et aI., 2007; Ryaboshapko et aI., 2007) and our analysis have found that trajectory modeling using a coarse meteorological data resolution is not suitable for simulating pollutant transport through an urban atmosphere, such as in downtown Toronto. The airflow at lower elevations, such as the 15 m and 50 m starting trajectory heights. are influenced by buildings that are southwest of the Hg sample inlet as shown in Figure 3.8. Unless the meteorological data input to the trajectory model fully accounts for the effects of urban structure on wind fields , there would be uncertainties as to whether the pollutants were transported to the sampling site via the trajectory pathway . The EDAS 40 km meteorological data used in the HYSPLIT model is sufficient to resolve regional point sources, as this was used in Lynam and Keeler' s study (2005) to identify sources within 30-40 km of the Detroit sampling site. However, this study requires finer meteorological data resolution to reso lve potential urban sources near downtown Toronto.

3.4.3 Analysis of Atmospheric Hg Species Ratios
RGM/PHg<2.5 and wind directions during the elevated GEM events observed in Toronto

were analyzed to detennine the regional sources impacting the site and confirm back trajectory modeling results. Figure 3.10 illustrates plots ofRGM /PHg<2.5 ratios and wind directions during six of the elevated Hg events, in which meteorological data was available at the sampling site (i.e., beginning of May 2004). The wind directions shown in Figure 3.10 were measured at two weather stations. WD 1 refers to the wind directions measured at the sampling site at a height of 14 m, whereas WD2 refers to the wind directions measured at the Toronto Island Airport at a height of 76.5 m. Toronto Island Airport is located in Lake Ontario, south/southwest of the sampling site. The wind directions measured at Toronto Island Airport are relevant to the analysis because it can be used to verify the trajectory paths generated from the HYSPLIT model, since the previous aerial photo suggests that the buildings were affecting the airflow from the southwest direction to the Hg sample inlet. During May to December 2004, most of the winds originated from the east and southwest directions at the Toronto Island Airport station and from the northeast and southwest directions at Ryerson University as shown in the wind direction frequency distributions in Figure 3.9.

Figure 3.10 illustrates that only the elevated Hg events on June 8 th , July 19 th and Oct 20 th were likely affected by Hg emissions from local/regional sources in Ontario. On the June 8 th episode (Figure 3.10(b)), the wind directions at the sampling site and Toronto Island Airport remained constant from the southwest direction as the RGM/PHg<2.5 decreases. As a result, it is probable that the elevated GEM concentrations on June 8th are due to sources located southwest of the sampling site. The average wind speed measured at Ryerson University during the June 8 th episode was 1.3 ± 0.8 mis, which suggests that the Hg plume could be transported by wind to the sampling site. Back trajectory results also confirm that the airflow passed through several sources southwest of the sampling site. Similar results were also observed for the elevated GEM concentrations on July 19 th (Figure 3.10(d)). The wind directions measured at both stations on the July 19 th were consistent with each other; both graphs illustrate the wind direction was constantly from the southwest as the RGM/PHg<2.5 decreases . Furthermore, back trajectory modeling confirmed that the airflow passed through several sources located in southwestern Ontario. However, the average wind speed during the July 19 th episode was only 0.54 ± 0.54 mi s, which suggests that the Hg plume might not have been transported by wind from another location. It is possible that daytime Hg emissions near the sampling site were trapped in a stable atmosphere during nighttime radiative inversion, which allowed for the gas partitioning process that converts RGM to PHg<2.5 to occur. Radiative inversion might lead to elevated pollutant levels in the troposphere because the radiation of heat from the ground surface at night produces a colder layer of air near the ground than the air at higher elevations. which prevents the vertical transport and dispersion of pollutants (Zoras, 2006). Atmospheric stability has been estimated based on measurements of

incoming solar radiation, cloud cover and wind speeds (Pasquill , 1961 ; Turner, 1964; Zoras et aI. , 2006). The Hg and NO x concentration peaks, calm winds (e.g. , O-O.S mls) , and clear skies (e.g. average cloud cover in July was ~ IS% , NASA, 2008) observed during the overnight hours suggest that radiative inversion might have occurred. However, radiative inversions are more common in the winter due to the potential for snow cover on the ground, which cools the layer of air adjacent to the ground surface (Elminir, 2007; Zoras, 2006). The elevated GEM levels during Oct 20 th (Figure 3.1 OCt)) were potentially impacted by primary metals facilities and sewage treatment plants, which were identified from the analysis of atmospheric pollutants ratios. The decreasing RGM/PHg<2.S coincided with the easterly winds measured at Ryerson University , which is consistent with the back trajectories that passed through a primary metals facility and two sewage treatment plants located east of the sampling site. The average wind speed was 3.3 ± 1.3 mis, which illustrates that wind was potentially transporting Hg plumes emitted from these sources to the sampling site. Figure 3.1 O(a), (c) and (e) illustrates that decreasing RGM/PHg<2.S were not observed on the May 2S th , June 28 th and Sep. 7th elevated GEM events. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the Hg plume from the sources identified by back trajectories was transported by wind to the sampling site during those three events. The back trajectories only track the path of air, which is not necessarily the same path as an Hg plume. The wind direction corresponding to the maximum Hg level during the three elevated Hg events was southwest, which suggests that there could be urban sources of Hg near the sampling site located in the southwest direction. The Hg speciation study conducted by Lynam and Keeler (200S) used RGM to PHg<2.5 ratios and wind direction data to determine whether regional sources were affecting the Hg levels measured in Detroit. In that study. a significantly lower RGM/PHg<2.S was observed in the

59

south to southwest direction, where there were industrial areas and populated urban centers located in Ohio and Indiana, than in the east direction (Lynam and Keeler, 2005). These sources were also confirmed by back trajectory modeling using HYSPLIT in their study.

3.5 Correlation Analysis Results
Correlation analysis was perfomled on the entire data set obtained from the Toronto site for each season and the results are listed in Table 3.5. The data set was separated into different seasons because ozone is affected by meteorological variables, such as solar radiation and temperature (Kim and Kim, 200]). Table 3.5 illustrates that correlations between Hg species and ozone are either weak or not significant in the winter. There is also a weak relationship between GEM and RGM , as well as RGM and nitrogen oxides and S02. In the spring, there is a moderate relationship between GEM and RGM (see Table 3.5). GEM and 0 3 were found to be weakly anti-correlated , and RGM and 0 3 were weakly correlated, which indicates the depletion of GEM by 0 3. converting GEM to RGM. The weak Hg-0 3 correlations do not necessarily indicate that photochemical reactions did not occur because the oxidation of GEM to RGM is a slow process (Han et ai. , 2004; Manolopoulos et ai. , 2007a; Sillman et a!.. 2007). Only weak cOlTelations between RGM. nitrogen oxides and S02 were observed . These results suggest that springtime RGM concentrations at the sampling site can be produced from both direct emission or indirectly from photochemical processes. The correlation results for the summer demonstrated that photochemical reactions with ozone played a bigger role in the production of RGM compared to other seasons. This is due to the significant negative correlation between GEM and 0 3 and strong positive correlation between RGM and 0 3. The correlations between GEM and RGM as well as RGM and S02 indicate direct emi ssion of RGM is still a potential source.

The ozone concentrations in the spring and summer are statistically higher than winter and fall (p<0.0005 , Wilcoxon Rank Test), which led to stronger correlations between RGM and 0 3 in the spring and summer. The strong GEM-RGM correlations al ong with the significant correlations between RGM. nitrogen oxides and S02 in the fall illustrate that RGM production is mainly dri ven by direct source emi ssion ofRGM . Although the oxidation of GEM by ozone does occur as evident by the negati ve GEM-03 correlation . the strong RGM-03 correlati on in the summer was not observed in the fa ll.

61

Correlation analysis was also conducted on the Hg species and criteria air pollutant concentrations corresponding to the elevated GEM events (GEM concentration > 20 ng/m\ The model predicted correlations of the air pollutants from Sillman et al. ' s study (2007) were used to investigate whether direct emissions or photochemical processes dominate the production of RGM. Almost all the elevated Hg events exhibited strong correlations between GEM and RGM, except for the Feb 28 1h and Sep
7'h

events, in which the correlations were not significant.

Among the correlated GEM-RGM events, only two events on May 2S Ih and June 81h showed strong cOlTelations between RGM and 0 3 (r = 0.S4 to 0.6S , p<O.OS) and anti-correlations between RGM and nitrogen oxides (r = -0.11 to -0.26). On the May 2SIh event, RGM and ozone concentrations peaked during the noon hour, which indicated the occurrence of photochemical reactions involving ozone and GEM. On the June 81h event, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (2008) issued smog advisories for the City of Toronto, which indicated increase levels of smog precursors, such as ozone and fine particulate matter. The levels of RGM and ozone peaked during noon and overnight hours (i.e., bimodal trend) on the June 81h event, which suggests the role of ozone on the oxidation of GEM in the afternoon and the potential transport of oxidizing air masses from distant sources at night. The latter point is supported by back trajectory modeling. RGM/PHg<2.S and wind analysis results, which traced the airflow to industrial and urban areas located in Ohio. The study by Lynam and Keeler (200S) also found that the industrial and urban sources in Ohio were impacting the Detroit site. It is possible that distant sources emit Hg and nitrogen oxide during daytime. which then formed ozone in the presence of sunlight. and thus produced an oxidizing air mass that converts emissions of GEM to RGM .

62

The June 28 th and July 19th events showed strong anti-correlations between RGM and 0 3 (r = -0.53 to -0.6] , p <0.07) and moderate correlations between RGM and nitrogen oxides (r = 0.37 to 0.5]). However, the diurnal nitrogen oxides trends do not suggest vehicle emission sources because nitrogen oxides concentrations peaked during the overnight and early morning hours, but the emissions might be related to other combustion processes, such as industrial processes (Liu et al. , 2007). Analysis of air pollutants to Hg ratios and back trajectories indicate that sewage treatment and metal production are potential sources for both events. But a decreasing RGM /PHg<2.5 was not observed on the June 28 event to suggest that Hg plumes from the sources were transported to the sampling site. The July 19 event could either be affected by regional sources due to the declining RGM/PHg<2.5, or the build up of pollutants emitted from nearby sources during nighttime radiative inversion. The Hg and NO x concentration peaks and the low wind speeds observed during the overnight hours might be related to radiative inversion, which produces a stable atmosphere that prevents the dispersion of pollutants. Weak RGM-S02 correlations were observed for all the elevated Hg events. This supports the previous model/data analysis results, i.e. , coal combustion sources were not the major contributor to the Hg levels at the Toronto site. However. coal combustion emits nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds that can lead to the formation of ozone, which might explain the elevated 0 3 levels on the June 8 event. A summary of the modeling/data analysis results and interpretation for all the elevated Hg events are shown in Table 3.6. Several other studies have examined the relationship of Hg species and ozone to determine whether photochemistry has an effect on Hg species levels and distributions. The method of analysis that is often used is correlation analysis between Hg species and ozone (Han
th th th

63

et aI. , 2004; Kim and Kim, 2001 ; Lindberg and Stratton, 1998; Lynam and Keeler, 2005; Sillman et aI. , 2007). Correlation between RGM and ozone levels was observed in the studies conducted by Lindberg and Stratton (1998) and Lynam and Keeler (2005), and a weak anti-correlation between GEM and ozone was also reported in Lynam and Keeler's study (2005). The studies by Han et a\. (2004) in New York and Kim and Kim (2001) in Seoul did not find significant positive correlations between measured RGM and 0 3 concentrations. Correlation analysis of modelpredicted GEM and RGM concentrations were also used to identifY direct emission sources or photochemical production ofRGM (Sillman et a\., 2007). In the study by Sillman et a\. (2007), the CMAQ (Community Multi-scale Air Quality) model , which is generally used to study the transport and transformation of pollutants by chemical reactions, was modified to model gasphase species and photochemical processes involving ozone, nitrogen oxides, organics, sulfur and mercury on a regional scale. The model results predicted an anti-correlation between GEM and RGM when RGM is formed from photochemical reactions, and a positive correlation between GEM and RGM when direct sources are emitting RGM . It also predicted that a strong correlation between RGM and ozone is likely when concentrations of ozone and its precursors (NO x, VOC) are elevated (which was observed in this study), and correlations between RGM and S02 or reactive nitrogen are indicators of direct emissions of RGM . Although these results provide some insight about sources of RGM. there are significant uncertainties with using models to predict RGM concentrations that have been discussed in literature. A comparison study (Ryaboshapko et al.. 2007) of various atmospheric Hg model s found that predicted and measured concentrations differed by a factor of 1.35-1 .5 for GEM and a factor of 10 for RGM and suggested that the large RGM discrepancies were mainly due to an incomplete understanding of the various chemical processes of RGM in the atmosphere (e.g ..

64

oxidation from GEM by various oxidants, RGM adsorption onto particulates, and wet deposition (Lindberg and Stratton, 1998), reduction of RGM to GEM in a mercury plume (Edgerton et ai. , 2006; Lohman et ai. , 2006)). Although chemical models are effective at estimating hydroxyl and ozone concentrations, which are involved in GEM oxidation, the oxidation of GEM by reactive halogens has not been modeled extensively (Lin et aI. , 2006). Thus, the use of the modeling results by Sillman et al. (2007) that attempted to differentiate between primary and secondary production of RGM could be very inaccurate if these RGM processes were not included in the model. The modeling study also attributed the uncertainties to the use of coarse resolution data in the models, which was a major issue raised from the back trajectory modeling results of the downtown Toronto area and a N0 2 pollution study in the Toronto-Hamilton area (Arain et aI., 2007). Furthermore, measurements of Hg in urban areas are prone to large spatial variability as evident by GEM concentrations measured at two different heights at the same urban location (St. Denis et aI. , 2006) and Hg emissions from urban surfaces (Eckley and Branfireun, 2008).

4. Conclusions and Significance of Findings
4.1 Conclusions

·

PMF and peA results: Model results of the annual (December 2003 to November 2004)
data and National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) emissions data suggest industrial processes (chemical production, metal production , sewage treatment), rather than coal combustion and cement and concrete production, were the major contributors to measured Hg levels in downtown Toronto. Both models also identified factors that cannot be characterized using NPRI emissions data .

·

Atmospheric Pollutants Ratio Analysis (NO-/Hg, PM2.YHg, SO-/Hg): Ratios of air
pollutants to Hg at the sampling site during the elevated GEM events (i.e. , GEM concentrations > 20 ng/m 3) are similar to those from chemical manufacturing, metal production, and sewage treatment facilities, and not coal combustion or cement and concrete production. The large NOx/Hg and S02/Hg from coal combustion and cement production relative to those of the sampling site indicate that these sources are likely not contributing to Hg levels in Toronto because of the large NO x and S02 deposition required to reduce the NOxlHg and S02/Hg. Since chemical manufacturing plants are located more than 300 km away from the Hg sampling site, the use of mercurycontaining products in an urban city is potentially a source of Hg.

·

Ratio Ana(vsis (RGMIPHg<2.5) and Back Trajectory results: Decreasing RGM/PHg<2.5 during 2 elevated GEM events on June 8th and July 19 th coincided with
southwesterly winds. suggesting the transport of Hg from regional sources. Back

68

trajectories during the June 8th and July 19 th events revealed several sources southwest of the sampling site, which included local sources (sewage treatment, electrical products production) and regional sources (metal production, sewage treatment, other urban cities). Hg emissions from nearby urban sources are potentially contributing to the elevated GEM event on July 19 t \ since an increase in pollutant (Hg and NO x) concentrations, lack of wind, and clear skies indicate stable atmospheric conditions. Decreasing RGM/PHg<2.5 during an elevated GEM event on Oct. 20 th coincided with easterly winds, and local sources east of the sampling site (metal production, sewage treatment) were identified by back trajectories and confirmed by wind directions measured by two weather stations in downtown Toronto.

·

Correlation Analysis: Direct emissions are the sources of RGM in spring, summer and
fall and photo-oxidation of GEM only becomes a major factor in the summer. RGM was correlated with 0 3 during 2 elevated GEM events on May 26 th and June 8 th . RGM concentrations peaked during the noon hours in both events. indicating the oxidation of GEM to RGM by 0 3. Nighttime RGM and 0 3 peaks during the June 8th event indicate the potential transport of oxidizing air masses at night from distant sources, which is consistent with back trajectory , RGM/PHg<2.5 , and wind analysis results. RGM and NO x were correlated during 2 elevated GEM events on June 28 th and July 19 th , suggesting combustion processes. but diurnal NO x trends were not consistent with vehicle emissions. Coal combustion is not likely a source ofHg in Toronto because RGM and S02 were not correlated in all the elevated Hg events: however. it does emit pollutants that can lead to the formation of ozone.

69

4.2 Significance of Findings
· The model results from this study suggested that metals production, sewage treatment and chemical products manufacturing contribute to atmospheric mercury in Toronto. The elevated Hg events in Toronto are attributed to emissions from regional point sources, photochemical processes involving ozone, and potentially urban sources near the sampling location that have not been identified or reported in the emissions inventory . These findings are significant because it provides some insight into sources that require more emissions control and pollution prevention measures. Metal processing plants were the top five emitters of Hg in Ontario in 2004 and since then, Canada Wide Standards on mercury emissions from base metal processing facilities have been implemented, which suggests that air pollution control technologies are needed . Although sewage treatment and chemical products manufacturing are not major emitters ofHg in Ontario, our data analysis have attributed these sources to atmospheric Hg in Toronto. This finding is significant because it has implications about the use and improper di sposal of products containing mercury. Hg emissions from sewage treatment facilities likely came from the disposal of Hg-containing products into landfills, where the acidic leachate containing Hg is potentially brought to the wastewater treatment plant, or Hg discharges from hospital s, labs, dental offices, or industrial plants are ending up in the sewage system. Pollution prevention measures are needed to encourage recycling of Hg-containing products and prevent the discharge of mercury into the sewer system.

·

The use of statistical and air quality models for Hg source identification in this study ha ve led to severa l discussions about data and model uncertainties. The HYSPLlT back

70

trajectory model does not accurately simulate the wind patterns through downtown Toronto because of the resolution of the meteorological data used in this study. Finer spatial and temporal resolution meteorological data is essential to model pollutant transport through the boundary layer of an urban atmosphere and to identify urban sources near the sampling site that are potentially contributing to the mercury levels measured in downtown Toronto. In this study, an attempt was made to verify the back trajectories by examining wind directions measured at two weather stations in downtown Toronto. Correlations of model-predicted GEM and RGM concentrations obtained from another study were used to identify the production ofRGM from direct emissions or oxidation of GEM by ozone. But studies have found that model-predicted and measured concentrations of GEM and RGM could differ by a factor of 1.5 and 10, respectively , which suggests the large variability in the correlations of model-predicted GEM and RGM concentrations. This finding emphasizes that GEM and RGM reactions and transport mechanisms need to be fully incorporated into atmospheric Hg models to conduct source identification studies.

·

The PMF and PCA model extracted factors that cannot be characterized using NPRI emissions data from point sources. The NPRI emissions inventory does not report emissions data from urban sources that emit Hg (e.g. , urban soils and pavement. use and disposal of fluorescent lamps and thermometers, fugitive emissions from buildings. traffic). These may be significant sources of Hg in Toronto, since only 3 major Hg point sources were within 100 km of the Toronto sampling site. Therefore. more research is needed to identify and quantify the Hg emissions from urban sources. To determine how

71

these sources affect Hg concentrations in the urban environment, future research might involve modeling the effect of traffic emissions on urban concentrations using a combined street canyon and Gaussian model , which has a spatial resolution ranging from
~20

km to a few meters (Mensink et aI. , 2008). The street canyon model simulates the

impact of traffic emissions on a particular street, and the Gaussian model simulates the contributions of other sources on the rest of the urban environment (Mensink et aI. , 2008).

5.1.2 Calculation of N0 2/Hg, PM 2,S/Hg and S02/Hg at the source

S02/Hg = 6 1,300 tonsl134 kg = 458 tons S02/kg of Hg

5.1.3 Calculation of N0 2/Hg, PM 2.S/Hg and S02/Hg at the receptor/sampling site
Given, for example, the following pollutant concentrations at the sampling site during one of the elevated Hg event: , , 3 N0 2 = 28 ppb ; PM 2.s = 5.5 f..lg/m~; S02 = 1 ppb: GEM = 5.560 ng/m ~; PHg<2.5 = 11.] 2 1 pg/m : RGM = 9.894 pg/m3

74

Convert concentration units from ppb to f,lg/m 3 using the Ideal Gas equation at standard temperature and pressure (O°C, 1 atm), since the Hg analyzer has referenced the concentrations to these conditions: For N0 2 (MN02 = 46 g/mol):

1 ppb ofN0 2 = 1 x 10-9 mol N0 2/moi of air
Thus for every 1 ppb ofN02 at O°C, 1 atm, Mass concentration = PVM N02/RT

= (101 ,325 Pa)(1 x 10-9 mol N0 2/moi of air)( 46 g/mol)/(8.314 l l mol K)(273 . l5 K) = 2.052 x 10-6 g/m3 = 2.052 f,lg/m3
For S02 (MS02 = 64 g/mol), every 1 ppb of S02 at O °c. 1 atm is equivalent to 2.856 f,lg/m3 using the Ideal Gas Equation. Thus, the mass concentration ofN0 2 is (28 ppb)(2.052 f,lghn 3/ppb) = 58 f,lg/m 3 , and the concentration ofS0 2 is (1 ppb)(2.856 f,lg/m 3/ppb) = 2.9 f,lg/m 3 . [Hg] = [GEM] + [PHg<2.5] + [RGM] = 5.560 ng/m 3 + (11.121 pg/m 3 )/(1 000 pg/ng) + (9 .894 pg/m3)/(1 000 pg/ng) = 5.581 ng/m3 Therefore, the N0 2/Hg, PM 2S /Hg and S02/Hg at the receptor/sampling site are
