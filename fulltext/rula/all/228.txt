September 2010 ­ Implementation team created

The study has given insight into the role of Summon in terms of undergraduate information-seeking behaviour. Participant feedback revealed potential improvements for Summon at Ryerson and will be useful to other institutions either using or considering the use of similar products. Overall, the results from the study will help to inform Ryerson Library practice surrounding future directions in reference, instruction, and service promotion.

Pros:
·· A good starting point for research ·· Great resource for first year students

Graduate Student Focus Group Feedback
Pros:
·· Options to refine search are clear ·· Very quick! ·· Easy to use is you have no previous experience ·· Accessible for all students (userfriendly)

Themes from focus grou ps
·· Faculty should encourage Summon for research, as students will use what is recommended to them by their instructors ·· Library should market Summon at specific times of the academic year, as many students only use research tools on an `as needs' basis ·· Quick tips should be provided in pop-up boxes on the Summon rather than creating video tutorials ­ attention span is short! ·· Promotion of Summon can be used through various methods, but best through faculty and mass email (students do read their messages!) ·· Undergraduate students, especially first year, found that Summon introduced them to new resources

Cons:
·· A little too broad with so many search results ·· Citations not always accurate ·· Lack of data & reports ·· Sometimes no full text articles ·· Overwhelmed by the amount of information
