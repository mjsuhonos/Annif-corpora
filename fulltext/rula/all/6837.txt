DYNAMIC FINITE ELEMENT (DFE) FORMULATION OF FUNCTIONALLY GRADED BEAMS Aaron Gee Master of Applied Science, Aerospace Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto (2017)

Abstract
The Dynamic Finite Element (DFE) theory is applied to calculate the natural frequencies of Functionally Graded Material (FGM) beams. The formulation derived is based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and material grading is assumed to follow a power law variation through the thickness of the beam. Results from DFE are numerically validated against methods such as Classical Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Dynamic Stiffness Method (DSM), as well as other data found in literature. Commercial software was used to further validate the proposed DFE formulation. The test cases showed that DFE results displayed excellent agreement to published results. When compared to the FEM method, DFE showed higher accuracy while requiring fewer elements to converge to the solution. Finally some general comments are made on possible future research paths for DFE method on FGM beams.

Introduction
1.1 Introduction

Functionally Graded Material (FGM) are a class of composites characterised by a change in composition through its volume, resulting in properties that vary spatially throughout the material [1]. Originally these materials were designed for use as heat shields to protect spacecrafts during re-entry. Presently, the applications of this material have been limited due to challenges in manufacturing. Powder pressing and sintering is a common method to produce FGMs, however the sintering temperature for each constitutive material can vary. The challenge is finding an optimal sintering environment that satisfies the requirements of all of the constitutive materials. For example, to illustrate the challenges in manufacturing, consider a medical implant, which may use titanium (Ti) and Hydroxyapatite (HAP). The optimal temperature for sintering HAP is 1150C and 1300C for Ti, a difference of 150C [2]. Titanium adds an additional level of difficulty as it must be sintered in a vacuum to reduce oxidation; however HAP is unstable in a vacuum and decomposes [2]. Engineers must determine an optimal solution that minimizes the negatives and maximizes the benefits of the material combination. The advent of novel manufacturing techniques such as electron beam freeform fabrication and additive manufacturing seem promising in solving/avoiding the challenges in manufacturing FGM and could lead to the wider use of the material [1, 3­5]. FGMs have seen use in industries such as aerospace, automotive, electrical/electronic and have many more potential applications in various industries such as biomedical implants [2, 6]. FGMs offer designers with high tailoring ability; they can use a variety of material types such as 1

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION metals, ceramics or polymers and can choose the amount to vary throughout the component. For example, similar to a bi-material composite (e.g. metallic component coated with ceramic), a metallicceramic FGM would offer a combination of the strength of the metal and the heat resistance property of a ceramic. However, the real advantage of FGM lies in the gradual change in the content of one material into the other. A traditional metallic-ceramic composite would have a sharp interface between the two materials, resulting in high interlaminar stresses. This is particularly detrimental for ceramic coatings as interlaminar stress caused by thermal loading leads to delamination and chipping of the protective coating. The gradual change of FGMs theoretically eliminates the sharp boundary between the two materials, reducing interlaminar stress, delamination, and thermal stress concentrations [5]. Due to the many advantages of FGMs over traditional composites and the possible proliferation of FGMs resulting from novel manufacturing techniques, closed-form analytical and numerical methods for static, dynamic, stability and vibration analysis of FGM beams have been a growing area of research.

Finite Element Method (FEM) Theory

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a well-established numerical method that can be used for a variety of engineering applications, such as modal analysis. It is a robust method that uses a systematic approach to solve complex systems by breaking the problem down into simpler forms. Polynomial shape functions are typically used and an element mass and stiffness matrices are produced. For modal analysis, the problem reduces into a linear eigenvalue problem, which when solved yields the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the system. The strength of FEM lies in its versatility, complex/irregular geometries and bodies of different materials can be analyzed with relative ease. Various loading types and boundary conditions can be introduced into a model. Furthermore, many companies have commercialized FEM software packages that simplify model creation and analysis for the user. The use of FEM has expanded beyond its original intended use as a structural analysis tool, to other disciplines such as mathematical physics, heat transfer, and acoustics. The wide range of applications that can be solved using this method is a testament to its versatility [7]. However, since FEM is an approximate method, the accuracy is dependent on the number of elements used. This is especially true when performing modal analysis at high frequencies, where larger numbers of elements are required to accurately capture the system's natural frequencies and mode shapes.

Dynamic Stiffness Method (DSM) Theory

Advancement in computing power has led to the development of the frequency dependent Dynamic Stiffness Method (DSM). The DSM is an exact frequency method; it provides an analytical solution to the free vibration problem. Where applicable, this method combines the coupled governing equations of motions into a single ordinary differential equation, where a closed-form solution can be found [8,9]. The general closed-form solution is used to obtain the frequency dependent stiffness matrix. In conventional FEM, there is a stiffness and mass matrix, but in DSM the resultant frequency dependent stiffness matrix combines the elastic and inertial properties into a single matrix. The DSM stiffness matrix is non-linear and the solution is exact within the limits of the theory. The DSM element can express an infinite number of natural frequencies and therefore, only one element is required to find any frequency. Consequently, the DSM method exhibits superior convergence performance than FEM, particularly at higher frequencies, where a greater number of FEM elements are required to obtain suitable accuracy. The major drawback of DSM is that a closed form solution to the governing equations of motion is fundamental to the formulation. This is only available for certain special cases and can be difficult to obtain for complex models.

1.4

Dynamic Finite Element (DFE) Theory

Hashemi [10] introduced a hybrid method, the Dynamic Finite Element (DFE) formulation, which combines the versatility of FEM with the accuracy of DSM. The DFE method is a semi-analytical solution; similar to FEM it uses the general procedure of the weighted residual method. In the DFE formulation an additional set of integration by parts on the weak form equation is performed and frequency dependent trigonometric shape functions are used, in contrast to polynomial shape functions, which are commonly used in FEM formulations. Since the DFE is a hybrid method it retains some characteristics from the FEM and DSM formulation. The formulation results in a single frequency dependent stiffness matrix that combines the inertial and elastic properties similar to DSM. Since DFE uses a weighted residual approach it retains the robustness of the FEM and can be applied to complex cases where DSM cannot. When compared to conventional FEM, the DFE generally exhibits much higher convergence rates, particularly at higher vibration frequencies. It is also interesting to note that Hashemi [10], has developed basis function expression that revert to the shape functions produced 3

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION by Hermite cubic polynomials at zero frequency. This means the DFE element would reduce to a conventionally FEM element when performing static analysis.

Literature Survey

The modeling of the effective properties caused by material grading was a prominent research topic in the 1990s. There were two approaches towards modeling of the effective properties, a detailed micromechanical approach or a simplified model based on the assumption of a smooth property distribution. The micromechanical model was a material science approach. Research focused on how the microstructure formed and the resulting effect on the distribution of material properties through the volume of the component. Micromechanical approaches included representative volume elements, percolation theory, fractal analysis, lattice-based microstructure models, renormalization group, neural networks, and Voronoi cell finite element method, a few selected papers are quoted, which provide an introduction and reference to the subject [11­15]. Researchers also attempted to use laminate theory to model the properties of FGM [16]. This method was not a popular approach because the laminate theory would use step changes in material properties. Steps changes would result in a sandwich beam architecture, which defeats the purpose of FGM because the model would not have a continuous transition of properties. The simplified model assumed a smooth property distribution and ignored the details of the materials microstructure. The justification of this model was that research focused on micromechanical modeling and manufacturing would produce the desired continuous property distribution. Instead, the simplified model would be used to demonstrate the benefits of actually applying FGMs to various applications. The rule of mixtures was used to model the properties of the FGM. Various functions to model the volume variation of the material was proposed, similar functions were used depending on the research area. Typically, research on fracture mechanics often used exponential variations [17] and linear variations were used for thermo-elastic/plastic effects [18]. Researches on modal analysis have commonly modeled material property variation according to a power law distribution [19]. As mentioned previously, the majority of early research on FGMs focused on manufacturing, micromechanical modeling and thermal stress. Prior to the 2000s papers on the topic of vibration were rare, a paper was found which dealt with the vibration of FGM shells [20]. However, in the last 17 years research on the free vibration of FGMs has risen drastically. A number of research papers have been

4

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION written for approximate and analytical solution of FGM beams. Supposedly, Elishakoff and Candan formed the first closed-form solution for general inhomogeneous beams [21]. This concept was further developed to include axial varying properties [22­24]. Li formulated an analytical solution to analyze the static and dynamic behaviours of FGM Timoshenko and EulerBernoulli beams [25]. Higher order theories were investigated to introduce more complex characteristics such as shear deformation and warping, a sample of research papers [26­38] are quoted here which provide a good introduction on the subject. Studies typically varied properties along the thickness for numerical simplicity. To maximize use of FGMs, designers should be able to tailor components by axially grading the material. A sample of research quoted here investigated varying properties axially [39­49]. Building on axially varying FGM beams, research has expanded into the variation of material properties along multiple directions (axially and through thickness) [50, 51]. Research has also expanded to stepped and tapered functionally graded beams [52, 53]. Turbine blades are a prime candidate for FGM use and as a result there have been a number of research papers on rotating thin walled beams. The objective of the research is to model FGM structures for turbines and rotating discs. Various authors quoted here, analyzed the vibration of rotating thin-walled beams [54­61]. The Timoshenko beam was a common beam theory used to model thin-walled rotating laminated beams [62­64]. In terms of approximate solutions, finite element approaches were found to be the most common. Various authors have applied the FEM to FGM beams based on Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theory [19,65­73]. Pradhan and Chakraverty [69] used the Rayleigh-Ritz method to formulate an element model to solve for the free vibration of Euler and Timoshenko beams. The Chebyshev collocation method has been investigated by various authors [70, 73] for Timoshenko and axially graded beams. Kahya and Turan [72] used a Lagrange equation approach to develop a model for analysing the vibration and buckling of first-order shear deformation theory beams. Shakeri et al. used Galerkin and Newmark methods to solve layered graded thick hollow shells [65, 66]. Simsek [67] investigated the vibration of functionally graded beams for Euler-Bernoulli, Timoshenko and the third order deformation theory. Several studies used the Dynamic Stiffness Method to find an analytical solution for FGM beams. Su and Banerjee have applied the DSM to the vibrational analysis of both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams [74, 75]. Rajasekaran applied Banerjee's DSM method to axially functionally graded beams [76]. Lee and Lee used the exact transfer matrix expression, which is similar to the DSM solution, to find 5

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION the natural frequency of an Euler-Bernoulli FGM beam [77]. Similarly, Hao and Wei [78] derived the dynamic stiffness matrix using state space differential equations. The DFE method has been extended to the vibration analysis of various beam-like structure problems [79­82]. Hashemi and Richard (1999) [79] presented dynamic shape functions and a DFE for the vibration analysis of thin spinning beams. Kashani et al. [80] extended the analysis of coupled bending-torsion beams to combined loadings. Hashemi and Adique [81] presented a DFE approach to various threelayered sandwich beam models. Erdelyi and Hashemi [82] applied the DFE method to delaminated Euler-Bernoulli beams. In all studies, when DFE is compared to the conventional FEM, the DFE generally exhibits much higher convergence rates, especially for higher modes of vibration.

Research Motivation

A main design motivator in the commercial aerospace industry is increasing the fuel efficiency of the aircraft and FGMs could be part of the solution. Two design levers that increase the fuel efficiency of an aircraft is a reduction of the aircrafts overall weight and increasing the thermal efficiency of its turbofan engines through higher core temperatures. A FGM using a combination of metallic materials could be optimized to provide similar structural characteristics to conventional materials with the goal of optimizing the weight. Metallic-ceramic FGMs can replace turbo-machinery components such as ceramic coated turbine blades or combustion liners. Theoretically a metallic-ceramic FGM should be more durable than traditional ceramic coatings due to the benefits of not having a sharp interface between layers. With more heat durable components a rise in core temperature could be possible, leading to higher thermal efficiencies. It is important to develop reliable methods of predicating the vibration behavior of FGMs as they can be a solution to the material constraints in today's aerospace industry. Free vibration analysis of functionally graded beams can be performed using various numerical and analytical techniques. From literature it is observed that conventionally FEM is commonly used and the frequency dependent DSM approach has been explored. These two approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. The conventional FEM is a robust tool that can perform analysis on complex geometry and loadings. In terms of accuracy, the DSM method is a better alternative particularly at high frequencies, providing 'exact' solutions to an infinite number of frequencies. However, the DSM

6

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION procedure requires the solution to the governing equations which can be difficult to obtain for complex problems and therefore the application of the method is often limited to special cases. The DFE method is a hybrid approach that combines the FEM and DSM method to retain the advantages of each method. The DFE method has been applied to various beam and plate structures and composites such as sandwich beams. To the best of the author's knowledge a DFE formulation has not yet been applied to the vibration modeling of structural members made of continuous nonhomogeneous materials such as FGMs. In the present study, a DFE method for the free vibration analysis of FGM Euler-Bernoulli beams under various boundary conditions and material variation is developed. The gradient properties vary along the thickness with a power-law distribution. Based on previously developed applicable governing differential equations of motion [74], the weighted residual method is used to develop the weak integral form of the governing equations. The closed-form solutions of the differential equations governing the uncoupled lateral and axial vibrations of the system are used as the basis functions of approximation space to derive the relevant Dynamic Trigonometric Shape Functions (DTSFs). Introducing the field variables, in terms of the DTSFs and nodal displacements, into the weak integral form of the governing equations and through additional mathematical manipulation leads to an element matrix resembling the frequency dependent element from the Dynamic Stiffness Method. The element matrices are then assembled and the boundary conditions applied to form the system's non-linear eigenvalue problem. The natural frequencies and modes of the system are extracted by solving the non-linear eigenproblem. A parametric study is performed to investigate the effects of various material grading and boundary conditions on the natural frequency and mode shapes. To validate the DFE formulation, results will be compared against FEM, DSM, sources from literature and results from a commercial FEM package.

Thesis Document Organization

The document is organized into four chapters and five appendices. A brief introduction to FEM, DSM, DFE methods as well as a literature survey are presented in the present chapter. Chapter 2 begins with introducing the methodology of modeling the material variation of FGM. The FEM, from governing equations to the matrices of the system, is presented. The DSM formulation used for the MATLAB code is also briefly presented. The DFE formulation is then introduced starting from the FEM weak form equation. The DFE is created through an additional set of integration by parts and the application of trigonometric shape functions. Some methods to solve the non-linear eigenvalue problem of DFE and DSM are briefly discussed. The natural frequencies are studied for various FGM beam configurations and parameters. Using the data, convergence test and numerical validations are presented. Finally, a parametric study is performed by varying the material grading parameter to investigate higher mode frequency and shapes. In Chapter 3 a FGM beam model created in ANSYS R is introduced. The model is created using a number of discrete layers with homogenous material properties in each layer. The properties of each layer were dependent on its location on the height of the beam cross section; i.e., through the beam thickness. The methodology used to model FGM using commercial software is discussed. Two models are presented with different mesh refinements and are used to compare with the results presented in Chapter 2. Finally, in Chapter 4 some conclusions are drawn based on the results of Chapters 2 and 3, and prospective topics to further the research of functionally graded beams is discussed.

Functionally Graded Euler-Bernoulli Beam
2.1 Introduction

In this chapter FEM and DFE formulations for functionally graded Euler-Bernoulli beams are presented. Using the Galerkin method of weighted residual the weak form equation of the governing equations is derived. For the FEM formulation polynomial shape functions are used to find the stiffness and mass matrices of the system. Additional mathematical manipulation is performed on the weak form equations to develop the DFE formulation. The trigonometric shape functions for the uncoupled bending and axial vibrations are then used to find the frequency dependent stiffness matrix. The DSM method derived by Su and Banerjee [74] is also presented and briefly discussed as it was used to create a MATLAB code for benchmarking and numerical validation purposes.

The Euler-Bernoulli beam is the simplest beam model and is based on the following assumptions [83]: · The cross section can be assumed to be rigid under the application of transverse and axial loads. · The cross section is assumed to remain planar and normal to the deformed axis during deformation To model the effective material property, P , of a FGM beam, the rule of mixtures is used and can be expressed as [67, 74, 75]: P (z ) = (Pt - Pb )Vt + Pb (1)

where Pt and Pb are the material properties at the top and bottom surfaces of the beam, respectively. Vt is the volume fraction of the top constituent of the beam which is defined as [67, 74, 75]: z 1 + h 2

As mentioned previously in the literature survey, the effective material properties for research on modal analysis commonly vary according to a power law distribution. Variation of the volume fraction against thickness for different values of k is represented in Figure 2.2, where k = 1 indicates a linear variation of material composition from the top to the bottom, k = 0 represents a beam composed entirely of the top material, and k =  represents a beam made entirely of the bottom material. In this investigation, the same governing equations of motions as those used by Su's and Banerjee's research [74], are utilized. To derive the governing differential equations, Su and Banerjee calculated the 10

Assuming simple harmonic motion, axial displacements, v and lateral displacement, w can be written as: v (y, t) = V (y )eit (6) w(y, t) = W (y )eit where  denotes the frequency, V (y ) and W (y ) are the amplitudes of axial and flexural displacements, respectively. By substituting (6) into (3) and (4), the governing equations can be rewritten as:

The loads or natural boundary conditions are the resultant axial force (F ), shear force (S ), and bending moment (M ), which are defined as [74]:

F = - A0 V + A1 W S = -I1 V  2 - A1 V + I2 W  2 + A2 W M = A1 V - A2 W (9)

2.3

Finite Element Method (FEM) Derivation

In what follows, a finite element formulation for the free vibration analysis of a FGM beam is presented based on a Galerkin weighted residual method. From the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and assuming simple harmonic motion, the equations of motions take the following form:

I0 V  2 - I1 W  2 + A0 V - A1 W

=0

(11)

Following the Galerkin method of weighted residuals, the above equation is expressed as a residual equation weighted by axial and lateral virtual displacements, v and w, respectively. The integral of the residual is set to zero, resulting in the following forms:
L

Wv =
0

v (I0 V  2 - I1 W  2 + A0 V - A1 W )dy = 0

The above expressions (14) and (15) also satisfy the principle of virtual work (PVW),

Wtotal = Wint - Wext = 0

(16)

where Wtotal is the total virtual work, Wint is the internal virtual work, and Wext is the external virtual work. The underlined terms in expressions (14) and (15) represent the virtual work generated by the load boundary conditions of the system, presented earlier as expression (9). For the free vibration of a

13

CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONALLY GRADED EULER-BERNOULLI BEAM system, the total external virtual work is Wext =0 and therefore: v (-A0 V + A1 W ) v (-A0 V + A1 W )

= Wext = Wext

Consequently, the net resultant virtual work caused by the external force and moment terms in (14) and (15) goes to zero. With the boundary conditions satisfied, the remaining parts of the expressions can now be discretized, leading to the following elemental form:
ln n wv = 0

((- 2 )v (I0 V - I1 W ) + v (A0 V - A1 W ))y

ln n ww = 0

((- 2 )w(I0 W ) + (- 2 )(w )(I2 W - I1 V ) + w (A2 W - A1 V ))y

The row vector [N (y )] represents the shape functions that describe the displacement along the domain of the element. Now that the shape functions have been defined, they are substituted into equations (18) and (19) resulting in:
ln n wv = 0

((- 2 ) < Vn > {Nv }(I0 < Nv > {Vn }- < Nw > {Wn }I1 ) (26)

+(- ) < Wn > {Nw }(I2 < Nw > {Wn } - I1 < Nv > {Vn }) + < W > {Nw }(A2 < Nw > {Wn } - A1 < Nv > {Vn })y The above terms can be combined to form the following eigenvalue problem: < Vn > ((K + Kcoupling ) -  2 (M + Mcoupling )){Vn } = 0

(28) < Wn > ((K + Kcoupling ) -  2 (M + Mcoupling )){Wn } = 0 The two equations above can be combined to create a 6 x 6 matrix for each element, where K is the element stiffness matrix, and M is the element mass matrix. The coupling terms have been separated to show the coupling relations between the two equations. The assembly of the element matrices and the application of boundary conditions then leads to the system's linear eigenvalue method, which is then

Dynamic Stiffness Method(DSM) Formulation

Su and Banerjee [74] have developed a Dynamic Stiffness method for FGM Euler-Bernoulli beams. This method exploits the analytical solution, forgoing any approximation within the limits of the theory. As a result, the DSM method is independent of the number of elements and is capable of providing exact results for all natural frequencies without discretization. The DSM formulation developed by Su and Banerjee [74] is briefly presented here for the sake of completeness. An in-house MATLAB code was created based on the formulation. First, the governing equations (7) and (8) are combined into a single sixth order ordinary differential equation. Introducing the non-dimensional term  = y/l (0    1) and the differential operator D = d/d :

(D6 + aD4 + bD2 + c)H = 0 where, 2A1 I1 - A0 I2 - A2 I0 2 2 L  A2 1 - A0 A2

At this point the dynamic stiffness matrix K can be used to calculate the natural frequency and mode shapes. Frequency can be found through various methods, a simple method would be to sweep through a range of frequencies to find the frequencies where the |K |=0. Other more complex methods such as the Wittrick-Williams algorithm can be used to solve for the natural frequencies in a more efficient process [74].

Dynamic Finite Element (DFE) Formulation

The DFE formulation follows the conventional FEM formulation using a Galerkin weighted residual approach. The formulation begins to diverge from a conventional FEM formulation after the discretized weak form equation is found. In an FEM formulation, the polynomial shape functions would be introduced at this point. However, for a DFE formulation, additional integration by parts is performed before the shape functions are introduced. Beginning by restating the already discretized weak form equation from the FEM formulation:
ln n wv = 0

((- 2 )v (I0 V - I1 W ) + v (A0 V - A1 W ))y

(50)

ln n ww = 0

((- 2 )w(I0 W ) + (- 2 )(w )(I2 W - I1 V ) + w (A2 W - A1 V ))y

(51)

the following term  = y/l (0    1) is introduced into the above equations, resulting in the following non-dimensional form:

The coupling terms are separated and labeled here for clarity. The characteristic equation of (*) found in (54) is a second order differential equation having the form -c1 D2 - c2  2 = 0, where the c terms are constants and D2 is the second partial derivative operator with respect to the non-dimensional length  . The characteristic equation of (**) found in (55) is a fourth order differential equation having the from c3 D4 + c4  2 D2 - c5  2 = 0, where c terms are constants and D4 and D2 are the fourth partial derivative and second partial derivative operators with respect to the non-dimensional length  , respectively. The closed-form solutions of the uncoupled integral terms (*) and (**), respectively, can be expressed in the following forms:

V ( ) = D1 cos( ) + D2 sin( )

(56)

W ( ) = C1 cos( ) + C2 sin( ) + C3 cosh( ) + C4 sinh( )

where D1,2 and C1,2,3,4 are constants. The term  is based on the characteristic equation of (*) in expression (54). - 2 I0 l2 A0

CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONALLY GRADED EULER-BERNOULLI BEAM Using expressions (54), (55) and the shape functions (1) through (8), presented in Appendix 2, the element dynamic stiffness matrix, [K ( )]k , is derived which consists of uncoupled and coupled dynamic
k stiffness matrices, [K ( )]k u and [K ( )]c , respectively. The resulting expressions for the uncoupled and

coupled dynamic stiffness matrices can be found within Appendix 3. The element dynamic stiffness matrix, [K ( )]k , is formulated by adding the eight coupled and uncoupled sub-matrices. The global dynamic stiffness matrix [K ( )], is obtained by assembling all the element matrices and applying the boundary conditions. The non-linear eigenvalue problem resulting from this method is:

[K ( )]Un = 0

(70)

where Un is the global nodal displacements of the system. The natural frequencies of the system would be the values of  , which yield a zero determinant, |K ( )| = 0, for the global dynamic stiffness matrix [10]. A simple procedure of finding the system's natural frequency is varying  in small steps to find the values that make the determinant zero. However, there are more efficient algorithms to solve for the natural frequencies such as the Wittrick-Williams algorithm. Hashemi [10] goes into detail of using various algorithms to solve for natural frequency. For the sake of simplicity, the simple procedure of sweeping through  was used for the results presented herein. It is worth noting that the basis functions are specifically chosen so that when the frequency approaches zero, the roots, ,  , and  of the characteristic equations also approach zero. Subsequently, the dynamic trigonometric shape functions and basis functions become identical to those generated from the Hermite approximations, which are commonly used for FEM. The form of the DFE basis functions were formulated to exhibit this property to ensure a complete solution at all frequencies. In other words, if this was not considered, a static deformation solution would not be possible.

2.6

Numerical Test and Results

In this section, three illustrative examples are presented to numerically validate the DFE formulation through vibration analysis. For the first validation study, the DFE formulation is compared to and numerically validated against the well-defined solution of solid beams. In this example, the beam is assumed to be made of aluminium and the frequency results are compared against classical methods and the DSM method. Various material grading, boundary conditions and slender ratios were investigated. 23

CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONALLY GRADED EULER-BERNOULLI BEAM The second validation case involves a FGM beam composed of aluminum and alumina. Similar to the first case, the beam is assumed to be subjected to various material grading and slender ratios. However, only the simply supported boundary condition is used due to availability of data in literature. The final validation study is similar to the second study, but uses a linear variation in material properties. Once the numerical validation is completed, further analysis is performed to investigate the natural frequency and mode shapes for FGM beams with different boundary conditions and material variation. Furthermore, comparisons are made between the convergence performance of DFE and FEM. The following non-dimensional parameter was used to normalize and compare results of various sources: b A Eb I

i = i L2

(71)

A pure aluminum beam can be considered a special case of a FGM beam. Using the current model, a solid aluminum beam would require an unattainable value of k =  (refer to Figure 2.2). To avoid the use of infinity Su and Banerjee [74, 75] have proposed two methods; setting the top and bottom properties within ±.0001%, or use a value of k = 106 . It was observed that both methods would produce the same result, and therefore, for the purposes of this investigation the former method was used. The material properties for the solid aluminum beam are: t = 2700.0027 kg/m3 , b = 2700 kg/m3 , Et = 70.00007 GP a, and Eb = 70 GP a. An in-house DSM code was also created using the method presented in reference [74] to numerically validate the DFE formulation. The first three natural frequencies for an aluminum beam using classical Euler-Bernoulli beam solution, DSM, FEM, and DFE for various boundary conditions are presented in Table 2.1 through Table 2.3. Excellent agreement is achieved for DFE in all conditions. The classical results used generic closedform solutions to the 4th order Euler-Bernoulli governing equation solution that is often found in standard texts [84]. There is a slight deviation between some of the classical results with the element based methods. The discrepancy is caused by the differences between the the equation of motion for a EulerBernoulli FGM beam and the conventional Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. The equation of motion for FGM has three uncoupled terms for lateral displacement, where as the conventional beam equation has two terms. This extra term results in the small difference between the results. However, the effect of this term is diminished as the slender ratio is increased.

Due to the frequency-dependent and highly convergent nature of DFE, both the DFE and DSM results also exhibit excellent convergence for higher frequencies, while FEM results start to deviate. In addition, for the conventional FEM, additional elements would be required to match the results of DFE and DSM. Figure 2.3 shows the FEM convergence test results for the 3rd mode of the homogeneous beam made from pure aluminum (Al). As can be observed from the figure, the conventional FEM nearly converges at around 10 to 12 elements. In contrast, DFE results show that a single element is capable of producing exact solutions. This is due to the fact the DFE method uses the solution of the uncoupled governing equation to create the DTSFs. Since this validation case uses no material grading, therefore, the coupling terms approach zero and the DFE solution is exact within the limits of the theory. To further validate the proposed DFE formulation, with coupling terms in effect, a second study is carried out with a FGM beam k = 0.3 composed of aluminum and alumina (Al2 O3 ), as also presented in [67]. The properties of the aluminum are: Eb = 70 GP a, b = 2700 kg/m3 and the properties of the alumina are: Et = 380 GP a, t = 3800 kg/m3 [67]. The reference results by Simsek [67] used a governing equation based on the third-order shear deformation theory, where solutions for Timoshenko and EulerBernoulli beams were presented. The author also included the effects of a moving mass in the formulation, however for the purpose of this paper only the solutions for a non-moving mass were presented. The 25

with I0 and A0 defined previously in (5). The natural frequencies,  , was calculated by manipulating equation (72) and then using equation (71) to convert to a consistent non-dimensional form. The first natural frequency values obtained using DFE, DSM, FEM and reference results for Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories are presented in Table 2.4. Since in this case the material grading effects are present, a single DFE element does not produce the exact results of the DSM method due to coupling effects. Additional DFE elements are required to converge to the solution. Note that the in-house DSM code and the reference DSM results deviate by about 1.6%. The author was unfortunately unable to resolve the difference between the two results; however there is an excellent agreement between the results of the in-house DSM code and reference [67]. Furthermore, the results of the in-house DSM, DFE and FEM converge to the same solution at higher element numbers. Therefore for validation and comparison purposes, the in-house DSM results were used as the benchmarks. Excellent agreement was found for reference Euler-Bernoulli results and the threeelement DFE solution, deviation was found to be extremely small; i.e., 0.121%, 0.160%, and 0.145%

Deviation between the DFE results and the Timoshenko beam values are 1.24%, 0.269%, and 0.181%. Again, DSM outperforms with a difference of 1.107%, 0.126%, and 0.0202%. The FEM showed the greatest discrepancy between results and reference values. When using the same numbers of elements, an error of 0.210%, 0.235% and 0.208% for Euler-Bernoulli and 1.323%, 0.345%, and 0.208% for Timoshenko was found. Since the formulations in this thesis are based on Euler-Bernoulli assumptions, a greater discrepancy is expected when comparing to reference Timoshenko beam results. Finally, a third vibration analysis was carried out for a FGM beam composed of steel and alumina with a linear variation in properties k = 1. The properties of the steel are: Eb = 210 GP a, b = 7800 kg/m3 and the properties of the alumina are: Et = 390 GP a, t = 3960 kg/m3 , also reported in Reference [35]. 27

100, respectively. DSM results performed better with a difference of 0.117%, 0.0240% and 0.00419%. Deviation between the DFE results and the Timoshenko beam values are 3.97%, 1.15%, and 0.142%. Again, DSM outperforms with a difference of 3.61%, 0.971%, and 0.0146%. Using three elements FEM had an error of 0.218%, 0.216% and 0.213% for Euler-Bernoulli and 3.96%, 1.21%, and 0.224% for Timoshenko. At an aspect ratio of L/h = 5 the frequency obtained from the DFE has a greater error than FEM, although this value is very small, 0.015% when compared to the reference Euler-Bernoulli value. From Table 2.4 and Table 2.5 it can be seen that there is a higher deviation in results at lower L/h ratios. Note that the present example is the first mode, where quite often the DFE and FEM results are very close. Deviation between DFE and FEM results occur more drastically at higher frequency, which will become apparent in the parametric study. To further investigate the effect of boundary conditions and material grading, vibrational analysis was performed to find the first four natural frequencies and mode shapes using the FGM beam presented in the third numerical validation study. The beam is composed of steel and alumina, a L/h ratio of 100 is used and the material grading variable k is varied from 0.1 to 5. The properties of the steel are: Eb = 210 GP a, b = 7800 kg/m3 and the properties of the alumina are: Et = 390 GP a, t = 3960 kg/m3 , as also reported in [35]. The results of Table 2.6 through Table 2.9 show that when using the same number of elements, the DFE model outperforms the FEM. This becomes more apparent at a higher frequency. For example, in the case of k = 1 and cantilevered boundary conditions, the 4th frequency obtained using the FEM and DFE exhibit an error of 0.274% and 0.183%, respectively, when compared to the DSM data. Now referring to the first frequency results, the error is found to be 0.00629% for both FEM and DFE. To model the 4th mode using FEM one would need at least 4 elements just to roughly detect and extract the mode shape. Since DFE uses frequency dependent interpolation functions, a single element can produce

an infinite number of frequencies. Figure 2.4 shows that even with a single element DFE produces less errors then 5 FEM elements. At higher frequencies fewer DFE elements can be used to develop results that are better or comparable to FEM. Figure 2.5 through Figure 2.7 show the lateral and axial mode shapes at the first three natural frequency, respectively. These figures show that lateral bending is the dominant mode shape and as a result only the lateral bending mode shapes will be presented moving forward. The bending mode shapes for C-F, S-S, C-C, and C-P boundary conditions for k = 1 are shown in Figure 2.8 through Figure 2.11, respectively. Figure 2.12 and Figure 2.13 show that C-F mode shape for values of k = 0.1 and k = 5, respectively. The mode shape remains unchanged, therefore for the current theory the through thickness variance of material properties does not affect the mode shape. This is expected due the fact that the Euler-Bernoulli theory assumes that the cross section remains plane and deforms only on the neutral axis. 30

CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONALLY GRADED EULER-BERNOULLI BEAM The effect of k on the natural frequency for various boundary conditions are shown in Figure 2.14 through Figure 2.17. L/h is fixed at 100 and k ranges from 0.1 to 5, where at 0.1 the beam is made mostly of Al2 O3 and trends towards steel as k increases. As k is increased the natural frequency decreases and at low values of k such as k < 2 the rate of which the natural frequencies decrease is greater.

Verification Using Commercial FEM Software
3.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter the DFE formulation for FGM beams was presented and the vibration characteristics were investigated under various conditions. Results from the DFE were numerically validated against DSM, FEM and other data available in the open literature. However, there was some deviation between DSM results reported in the relevant literature and the results generated using an in-house DSM code. In this chapter, to further validate and build confidence in the results presented, a FGM beam model will be analyzed using the commercial FEM software package, ANSYS R .

3.2

ANSYS R Model

A 3D model of a FGM beam was created in ANSYS R . ANSYS R workbench's 3D modeling tools provide a relatively simple way of introducing a material gradient effect into the model. By creating layers similar to a layered sandwich beam and constraining each layer a simple FGM model can be created. A visual representation of the cross section is shown on the left in Figure 3.1. Material properties are calculated for each element based on its location on the cross section using expressions (1) and (2). Each element

46

CHAPTER 3. VERIFICATION USING COMMERCIAL FEM SOFTWARE is homogenous with material properties calculated at the centre point. An adequate number of elements in the cross section is important to capture the material grading effect.

Figure 3.1: Cross section and mesh of ANSYS R FGM model. Material properties and geometry are the same as the values used for the third verification and parametric study reported earlier in this thesis (see Chapter 2 section 6). Material properties are Eb = 210 GP a, b = 7800 kg/m3 , Et = 390 GP a, t = 3960 kg/m3 , k = 1 and the FGM beam crosssectional geometry is b = 0.1, h = 0.1, and L/h = 100 [35]. 30 layers were found to be adequate to model material grading and converge to the solution. An additional 2 elements were added to simplify model creation so that each layer thickness could be divided evenly. A visual representation of the cross section mesh is shown on the right in Figure 3.1. Note, that when using too many layers, for example 64, each layer's thickness becomes very small and the model may become unstable. The instability is due to how the elements are constrained, the contact constraint forces two nodes to be coincident. However the element sides can penetrate leading to large errors. This is easily noticed when analyzing the mode shapes with increased scaled deformation. The length of the elements along the y axis is varied to change the number of elements in the model. Two different size meshes were created, a coarse mesh of 10240 elements (32 x 32 x 10) and a fine mesh of 40960 elements (32 x 32 x 40). The three dimensional quadratic SOLID186 element from the ANSYS R 47

CHAPTER 3. VERIFICATION USING COMMERCIAL FEM SOFTWARE element library was used to mesh the body. It is a 20 node homogenous element having three degrees of freedom per node (translation in x, y , and z ). The standard Block Lanczos solver was used to solve for the natural frequencies and mode shapes.

3.3

ANSYS R Results

a Results

from in-house MATLAB code

The coarse ANSYS R model results, shown in Table 3.1, show very good agreement with those obtained from the DFE, DSM and FEM formulations derived in this research. The element formulations in Chapter 2 also used 10 axial elements, but a single element was used for the cross-section in contrast to the 32 x 32 layers used in the ANSYS R model. Using a FGM element eases the modeling, as the material

CHAPTER 3. VERIFICATION USING COMMERCIAL FEM SOFTWARE variation is built into the formulation. Slight deviations can be seen, which can be most likely attributed to the differences between the ANSYS R elements and the derived formulations. The SOLID186 element is derived using higher-order equations and includes 3D effects. Nonetheless the deviations are very small (<0.4%) for most frequencies. An anomaly in the results was found for the third frequency for the simply supported boundary condition. However, by adding more axial elements the issue is resolved, as seen in the fine mesh model. The fine mesh model generally showed less deviation in higher mode results. Again, some deviation can be found. As mentioned earlier this was attributed to the difference in the elements' formulation.

Conclusion
4.1 Concluding Remarks

Based on the Dynamic Finite Element (DFE) formulation, a new element was developed to conduct vibrational analysis of Euler-Bernoulli functionally graded beams. The DFE results were compared with 'exact' results from DSM and those obtained from FEM and sources from literature. Comparisons were made between DFE, FEM, and DSM results for various L/h ratios, k values and material properties. The results were further validated using the commercial FEM software package ANSYS R . DFE exhibited higher convergence rates compared to FEM, particularly at higher frequencies. In the absence of material grading, the results obtained from a one-element DFE model are 'exact' within the limits of the theory.

4.2

Future Work

From the successful implementation of DFE for Euler-Bernoulli FGM beam, the next step would be to extend the element formulation to more complex FGM beam theories. The first-order shear deformation theory, or the Timoshenko beam theory, would be the next logical beam theory to apply the DFE formulation. By using the Timoshenko theory, shear deformation and rotary inertia effects would be accounted for. Su and Banerjee [75] have successfully extended the DSM method to FGM Timoshenko beams and could be used as a reference for comparison and validation purposes. The majority of research on FGM has dealt with the through thickness grading of material prop50

CHAPTER 4. CONCLUSION erties. To enable more design choices axial grading can be considered as well. Therefore, analytical and numerical methods for axial graded beams are required. Elishakoff et al. [21­23] have developed analytical and numerical solutions to axial graded beams. The method used to solve for the axial graded beams seemed to only satisfy the simply supported boundary conditions. Further investigation would be required to understand if the DFE method would be able to model axially graded beams with various boundary conditions.
