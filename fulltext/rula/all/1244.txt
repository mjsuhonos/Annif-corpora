Inclusion of such a camera requires methods of determining relative, interior and exterior
orientation information, as well as bore-sight and lever arm determination. Specialized methods

of mosaicking the imagery are also required. This paper focuses on exploring these methods for spherical cameras. Several computer programs were developed to solve for relative, interior, and exterior orientation parameters. It was concluded that a spherical camera can be efficiently

utilized for highway data collection and provides full data coverage with a single camera system.

1. Introduction
1.1 Mobile Mapping

In the past decade, expansion and growth of urban areas has occurred rapidly.

The

occurrence of rapid growth requires city planners to have access to detailed and recent
information related to location and control for sites under development. The high demand for

location information can also most recently be seen in Alberta, where development has been
booming over the last few years. With the rising demand of location information, Geographic The information

Information Systems which are spatially referenced have been developed.

contained within a Geographic Information System have been collected via various methods, such as surveying and GPS point collection, however these methods are often expensive and
provide only point information, rather than full coverage. An additional drawback of these

methods is that they are often time consuming, and do not answer, "increasingly complex

questions concerning the interaction of different factors in urban centers and their time

dependencies." (El-Sheimy, pg 1, 1996). Fortunately, the field of photogrammetry (both aerial
and close-range types) has developed and can provide a solution to rapid data collection which

conventional methods fail to realize. One such solution is the deployment of a mobile mapping
system.

Mobile mapping has been around for decades, but until recently has not gained as much
attention as it now does today. This was due primarily to the fact that Mobile Mapping Systems

(MMS) were, in the past, heavily restricted to areas of application in which the exterior orientation parameters of the cameras/sensors onboard the vehicle could be easily determined.
This meant that mobile mapping activities had to be conducted in such a way so that the exterior orientation parameters could be derived from ground control points. However, over the last

decade, significant advances in satellite technology, as well as inertial navigation technology, have removed this restriction from MMS's. Mobile Mapping Systems can now operate virtually anywhere, and thus the need for ground control points has vanished. Further advances in

technology have resulted in a transition from the traditional analog based methods of image
collection (i.e., film) to digital based methods of image collection. These advances have now

resulted in a mobile mapping system which contain various sensors and image capturing devices,
as well as the capability to acquire, store and process georeferenced data.(Schwarz et. al 2004).

interest, as well as a positioning device, and an orientation device. will be discussed herein.
1.2.1 Sensors

Each of these components

Determination of the three-dimensional coordinates of the camera exposure stations, in the past, was primarily done by a method known as photo triangulation. Photo triangulation is a method in which intersection points of the same object in different images, with known threedimensional coordinates, are used in a computational process to derive the position and

In the field of photogrammetry, the most important device is the sensor for which the system uses to image the area of interest. Two different types of sensors exist; active sensors and passive sensors. An active sensor is a sensor which provides its' own source of energy to The sensor operates by emitting energy, in the form of

back to the sensor where it is detected, measured and then recorded by the sensor system. The

More recently, the Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS), "has become generally available and has been considered fully operational on a worldwide basis since 1993." (Ebadi, pg 6, 1997) The development of the Global Positioning System has allowed for a much easier way
to determine the exterior orientation parameters (position and orientation) of the camera

sensors do not have their own source of radiant energy. In photogrammetry, the sensor most commonly employed is the camera. A standard

rover receiver is held stationary."(Wolf et al, 2000). The purpose of including a "start-up" time is so that integer ambiguities can be calculated by software applications. After the unknown However,

When taking photographs during a photogrammetric survey, it is always desirable to have
the optical axis of the camera to be vertical to the surface being imaged. However, despite great efforts to achieve this goal via, for example in aerial photogrammetry, the use of leveling
instruments such as level vials, as well as the use of other stabilization equipment, it is usually not the case that the optical axis will be vertical to the surface being imaged. When the optical

signal lock with the GPS system, the INS can help the situation by supplying very accurate

information about the initial position, as well as the velocity of the platform, providing
'trajectory' information about the platform. In addition to these benefits, the GPS can also assist

(Cramer et al, pg 2, 2001).

With respect to the imaging sensor (camera) used onboard the platform to map the area of interest, the benefits of an onboard integrated GPS/INS system becomes increasingly apparent. "The direct measurement of the fully exterior orientation of any sensor during data recording becomes feasible [due to the inclusion of an integrated GPS/INS], which offers an interesting

triangulation."

(Cramer, pg 2, 2001).

However, due to the fact that the GPS/INS system is

physically separated from the imaging sensor, there exist several offsets that must be determined
in order to properly identify the final positioning information of the imaging sensor's perspective center. The diagram below from El-Sheimy (1996) illustrates the relationship between the GPS,
INS and camera frames (c-frame).

3.2 Interior Orientation Parameters

Interior orientation parameters are the elements which define the interior geometry of any standard metric or digital camera. The calibration of a camera to determine these parameters is a process which must be performed prior to any photogrammetric survey. There are four

components to interior orientation parameters. These are listed below:

The principal point coordinates (xp ,yp),

3.2.2 Lens Distortion Parameters Determination Lens distortions are caused by imperfections in the manufacturing of the lens, and result in incoming light rays being bent and changing directions after passing through the lens in such a way that their direction of travel is no longer parallel to their incoming directions. They do not degrade the image quality, but they do degrade the geometric quality of the images. Two types of lens distortions which are normally prevalent are the symmetric radial lens distortions as well

Once the vertices of the regular pentagon have been determined, it now becomes possible to determine the coordinates of the vertices of every other pentagonal face of the dodecahedron. This can be done by first introducing the Z-Axis to our already established coordinate system.

Top Face -m- Upper-Right Face

The positive Z-Axis points out of the page, and completes the right-handed coordinate system.
Next, the pentagon given above is designated as the "top" face of the dodecahedron. This gives a dodecahedron whose coordinate system is centered on the top face.

Fig 3.7 - Pentagon with V4 Centered on Origin, followed by rotation of 64 Degrees about X Axis, followed by
another rotation of 108 degrees about the Z-Axis

To compute the coordinates of the vertices of each pentagonal face of the dodecahedron with respect to the coordinate frame centered on the top face, the knowledge of the dihedral
angle of a dodecahedron is utilized. The dihedral angle is the angle between any two adjacent

The rotated pentagon is then translated in such a way so as to align edge V4-V3 to edge V2-

V3. This is done by adding the coordinates of vertex V2 to all of the V coordinates. This gives
the following figure:

faces of a polyhedron.

In the case of a dodecahedron, this angle is approximately 116 degrees.

Next, the coordinates of the vertices of the top face about the x, y and z axes are rotated by various angles, and then translate these coordinates so as to obtain the coordinates of the vertices of the pentagonal faces of the upper portion of the dodecahedron. Rotation angles about the Z-

Axis are derived using geometric knowledge of a pentagon, whereas rotations about the X/YAxes are derived from knowledge of the dihedral angle. An example is given below for the

determination of the vertices of one of the faces. First, a translation is applied to the points such

The equation used to calculate the coordinates of the vertices of the new face is given below:

To compute the coordinates of the vertices of the pentagonal faces on the lower portion

of the dodecahedron, the vertices of the upper portion of the dodecahedron are rotated about the

Once the coordinates of the vertices have been computed, the centroids of each pentagonal face can also be computed. The reason that the positions of the centroids are required

is because the centroid is essentially the position of the perspective centre of the camera on the respective faces of the dodecahedron.

e31

=

bi-sector = e4l +e3l (3.12, 3.13, 3.14)
7--7

For each face:

1)

Compute Vectors V3V1 and Vectors V4V1, then compute the bi-sector of these two vectors. Normalize the bi-sector to obtain direction vector of the Y-Axis:

Yaxis - direction= normalize(bi - sector)

(3.15)

2) Take the cross-product of e4l and e31, then normalize to obtain the direction vector for
the Z-Axis:

Zaxis - direction = normalize(e4l x e31)

(3.16)

3) Take the cross-product of the Y-axis Direction vector with the Z-axis Direction vector to

obtain the X-axis Direction:

Xaxis - direction = Yaxis X Zaxis

(3.17)

4) With the direction of each axis defined, the following matrix can be formed

eLF=

(3.25)

Where eLF describes the orientation of each axis on the local face, and each column in

the above matrix is the direction vector for the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, respectively.

These angles were computed for each face and were equivalent to the angles used to initially rotate the coordinates of the vertices of the reference face.

5)

To check the rotation angles and ensure they are correct, the rotation matrix that rotates

the coordinate frame of the top face to the coordinate frame of the face under
investigation must be determined. This is done by forming the following relationship:

Each face was assigned a "camera" number. In Table 3.1, each camera number is given with its' offset and orientation. Prior to this, the location of the reference frame was translated

downwards from the top face to the centre of the dodecahedron to simplify the situation.

Since eLF is known, and eTF is known, one must only solve for the elements of R . This is

simplified further by the fact that eTF is identity. This gives the following:

4. Solving for Interior Orientation Parameters
The self-calibrating bundle adjustment was utilized to solve for the interior orientation
parameters of each camera of the dodecahedron. The relative orientation parameters determined

The result is

in Section 3 were used as estimates of the exterior orientation parameters for the model. For the

purposes of this research, the method employed is the Normal Equation Formation method of
solving the self-calibrating bundle adjustment. The following algorithm was programmed using the Fortran programming language and utilized for a 12 camera, 12 image, 697 point, 804
observation system (see Section 6 for results and observations). For completeness, 12 cameras,

resulting in 12 images, is chosen to reflect the entire dodecahedron. In reality, with respect to the
actual camera system, this would really be an 11 camera and, therefore, an 11 image system.

Ground control points were simulated by generating a series of virtual "spheres", each centered at the centre of the dodecahedron, and each with varying radii. Each sphere was tessellated using

different grid spacing to generate the virtual points.

Given below is an example of one of the

virtual spheres centered at the center of the dodecahedron.

Re-arranging Equation 4.1 and solving for focal length, a focal length of 381 pixels is obtained. For each of the virtual points on the sphere, corresponding observation image points

were generated for each camera, using the collinearity equations, and the parameters of interior
and exterior orientation given below:

surveys, for example, "Ground Control Points (GCPs) were the only required source of
information for providing the georeferencing parameters and suppressing undesirable error

propagation." (El Sheimy, 1996).

Ground Control Points are used as input to the bundle

adjustment to obtain the exterior orientation parameters for the cameras used in the survey. The
requirement for GCPs proved to be a costly and highly restrictive process; that is, it becomes

quite expensive to establish GCPs in the survey region, and in many cases it is not possible (or
rather, very difficult) to establish GCPs in certain inaccessible areas.

As part of the indirect georeferencing process, "the use of auxiliary position and

navigation sensor data" (El Sheimy, 1996) has been utilized in the past to assist in the
determination of the exterior orientation of the camera. Examples include the use of gyros,

horizon cameras and statoscopes (El Sheimy, 1996). However, even including this auxiliary data
still does not remove the need for GCPs. In the close-range photogrammetry case, the problem becomes even more demanding. Establishment of GCPs for a close-range photogrammetric survey (utilizing a system such as that

proposed in this research paper) is even more difficult and bothersome. The development of the Global Positioning System (GPS) helped ease this situation tremendously. The inclusion of a

GPS system in a photogrammetric survey (aerial or close-range) finally provided the means to

directly measure the exterior orientation parameters desired and thus could potentially eliminate

the need for GCPs. (Ackerman, 1995). However, limitations to the use of GCPs in a close-range

Direct georeferencing provides the means to obtain accurate positioning information

during the course of a photogrammetric survey, without the need for GCPs. This is particularly
advantageous for close-range photogrammetric surveys such as that discussed in this paper.

Direct Georeferencing of a photogrammetric survey can be realized by the inclusion of GPS and INS instruments onboard the survey platform. As was discussed in Section 1.2.4, the presence of
GPS and INS concurrently allow for the presence of signal lock to be more forgiving, as the INS
can provide trajectory information during the signal loss period, and thus provide very accurate

coordinate vector rc of the camera frame (c-frame) to the 3-D coordinate vector rm of the
mapping frame (m-frame)." (El-Sheimy, pg 53, 1996). For an integrated sensor system

consisting of a camera, GPS and INS, the determination of the coordinates of some object point appearing in the data imagery requires the determination of the coordinate vector which originates from the origin of the mapping frame to the center of the camera system must be
determined so that the vector corresponding to the location of the object point in the camera

As noted by El Sheimy (1996) the notion of direct georeferencing "is conceptually

different from the notion that a block of connected images and sufficient ground control is
needed to solve the georeferencing problem", as was the case of the indirect georeferencing
method. Direct georeferencing is a much more flexible option for photogrammetric surveys as

Gray level corrections and seam elimination.

Geometric corrections are essentially a series of corrections or processes by which an image
point is mapped to a new location (Hall, 1996). In the case of the spherical camera, one must

view the world as a "spherical" world, where each point in the real world, appearing in the image, must be thought of as residing on the surface of a "sphere" in the real world, centered at the centre of the dodecahedron. This is because in close-range photogrammetry cases, it is often
very difficult to obtain "depth" information (i.e., how far away an object is from the camera). In the aerial photography case, depth information is readily available; however this is much more

difficult to obtain in close-range photogrammetric surveys. A proposed method for mosaicking
imagery captured by the spherical camera will be discussed in this section.

Aside from the mosaicking/geometric correction aspect, portions of the images which overlap with each other must be dealt with. Finally, a colour-balancing and seam line

elimination method must be employed. This is often required due to the fact that each camera's radiometric specifications may differ from one another's. Thus, if colour-balancing and seam

line elimination is not performed, the image mosaic may appear "patchy", and each scene of the
mosaic may be easily delineated from one another. This is an undesirable effect of image

mosaicking, and must be dealt with. Possible methods for colour-balancing imagery captured by the spherical camera will also be dealt with in this section.

center of the dodecahedron) is made. In reality, this is not the case; however this assumption can be made given the knowledge that in reality, the perspective centers of the cameras in the dodecahedron array are offset from each other by only a few centimeters. If a sphere is chosen to project our images onto in such a way so that the radius of this sphere is large enough to compensate for the error in making the assumption that each camera is centered at the same
point, then this error can be considered negligible.

these effects are not an issue since the system is not imaging through the atmosphere. However, there will be numerous sharp terrain changes occurring all around the spherical camera, and as
such colour balancing is still necessary.

When mosaicking imagery, it is often the case that imagery acquired may have been acquired under different conditions (i.e., different day, time, season, year, etc). In the case of a

spherical camera, it may also be the case that one camera may view something that has a shadow, but from another camera's point of view that shadow is not present. When this occurs, the radiometric properties of a scene may differ from one image to another. This is dependent on when the imagery was acquired relative to the other imagery in the full "data set", as well as the various cameras which were used to acquire the data. When these radiometric differences are

For decades, researchers have worked extensively to develop good colour balancing
techniques. Among the various colour balancing methods in existence, one of the most

commonly utilized methods employed today is based on histogram matching techniques.

The over-all effect is that of a "patch-work" looking mosaic, where each

one point per line in the overlap region. In Milgram's algorithm, image information from to the left of the point in question comes from the line segment of the left hand tile, whereas the
information that comes to the right of the point will come from the right hand tile. From

"Smoothing at s involves apportioning H among the neighbours of s to the right and left

The slope of the ramp indicates how many of the neighbouring points are affected by the

more gradual slope can be applied. However, the trade-off here is that the information around

overlapping images in the scene. In the previous sections, the assumption was made that all of
the cameras in the dodecahedron array could be considered to be centered at the same point.
However, this is not the case, and as such this discrepancy will result in a mis-registration between the two images, making colour balancing and seam line elimination more difficult. One potential solution to this problem could be to down sample the images just enough so as to compensate for the mis-registration error. An example of this would be to take 4 pixels in the affected area, and make it one pixel in a "new" down-sampled image. Care would have to be

colour balancing techniques, in combination with the self-calibrating bundle adjustment program developed already, and the bore-sight and lever arm determination algorithms, to complete the
software package. In addition, further refinements to the mosaicking method to compensate for the assumption made of all cameras being located at the same point should be explored, as well as other methods to eliminate spurious grey level pixels attributed to sudden changes in
overlapping imagery should also be undertaken.
