AN OPTIMAL CONTROL FRAMEWORK TO DETERMINE DIFFUSIVITY VERSUS CONCENTRATION SURFACES IN TERNARY SYSTEMS OF TWO GASES AND A NON VOLATILE PHASE Doctor of Philosophy 2014 Amir Jalal Sani Chemical Engineering Ryerson University

Abstract
Diffusivity is a strong function of concentration and an important transport property. Diffusion of multiple species is far more frequent than the diffusion of one species. However, there are limited experimental data available on multi-component diffusivity. The objective of this study is to develop an optimal control framework to determine multicomponent, concentration-dependent diffusivities of two gases in a non-volatile phase such as polymer. In Part 1 of this study, we derived a detailed mass-transfer model of the experimental diffusion process for the non-volatile phase to provide the temporal masses of gases in the polymer. The determination of diffusivities is an inverse problem involving principles of optimal control. Necessary conditions are determined to solve this problem. In Part 2 of this study, we utilized the results of Part 1 to determine the concentrationdependent, multi-component diffusivities of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in polystyrene. To
iii

that end, solubility and diffusion experiments are conducted to obtain necessary data. In the ternary system of nitrogen (1), carbon dioxide (2), and polystyrene (3), the diffusivities and versus the gas mass fractions are two-dimensional surfaces.

INTRODUCTION

Diffusion can be defined in very simple terms as the movement of molecules from one place to another due to a concentration gradient (Philibert, 2005). Chemical engineers frequently deal with situations in which three or more components move from one place to another at the same time. The conventional approach of mass transfer in a system is based on the assumption that the movement of a chemical species from one place to another is directly proportional to a driving force. The problem is that this assumption is only good for cases in which diffusion is occurring in a two-component system (binary system), in a system in which one component is diluted by a large excess of one or more of the other components, or in a system in which all of the components in the mixture have similar quantities and natures. The question arises concerning whether the three or more components diffusing in a system can be dealt in a same way as the components of a binary system. Answer to this question is "No," so we must deal with the problem of how to deal with a multi-component system. Concerns such as this have been on the minds of chemical engineers for a long time(Krishnamurthy & Taylor, 1982). Multi-component diffusion systems exhibit characteristics that are quite different from those of binary systems. In addition, methods have been developed to predict multicomponent diffusion in a consistent way using matrix formulations (E. L. Cussler, 2009). The

2

matrix of a multi-component system can be incorporated into powerful computer software, which can be used in equipment design. This is one practical application of the multi-component diffusion matrix. Multi-component diffusion occurs when the flux of one component is influenced by the concentration gradient of a second component. For example, the flux of the first

component can be increased by as much as an order of magnitude by changing the concentration gradient of the second component. In multicomponent diffusion, the first component can diffuse against its concentration gradient, i.e., from a region of lower concentration to the region of higher concentration. The following examples explain these effects in detail. Figure 1.1 shows a tank that contains two homogeneous mixtures that are separated by a polymer membrane.

Figure 1.1. Two homogeneous mixtures separated by a polymer membrane

The right side of the tank contains a solution of sodium sulfate, and the left side of the tank contains pure water. As the experiment begins, sodium sulfate diffuses from the right side of the tank to the left side of the tank, and the process continues until the concentrations
3

of sodium sulfate are equal on both sides of the tank. At this point, if acetone is added to the right side of the tank, the diffusion rate of sodium sulfate to the left side of the tank increases. As more acetone is added, more sodium sulfate diffuses to the other side of the membrane. However, if acetone is added to the left side of the tank, the rate of diffusion of sodium sulfate is decreased, and, if acetone is added on both sides of the porous membrane, the diffusion of sodium sulfate is increased slightly. This shows that the gradient of acetone strongly influences the diffusion of sodium sulfate (E. L. Cussler & Breuer, 1972). For the second example, consider Figure 1.2 in which tube 1 contains an equimolar mixture of hydrogen and argon, and the bottom tube 2 contains an equimolar mixture of methane and argon. The two tubes were connected to start the experiment, and they were disconnected to end the experiment. Since the initial difference in the argon concentration in the two tubes was zero, it was predicted that the difference in the concentration of argon in the two tubes would remain zero. However, when the concentration of argon was measured in both tubes at the end of the experiment, it was found that the gradients of hydrogen and methane had influenced the gradient of argon (Arnold & Toor, 1967). Figure 1.3 presents a third example. A small drop of a strong acid was coated with a thin layer of liquid ion exchange resin and then immersed in a weak acidic solution of nickel.

At the beginning of the experiment, the nickel diffused from the outside of the drop into the drop across a membrane. But the diffusion of the nickel did not stop even when the concentration of nickel was the same on both sides of the membrane. Nickel continued to diffuse into the drop even when the concentration of nickel inside the drop was many times greater than the concentration outside the drop. In this example, the concentration difference of the acid causes a flux of nickel against its gradient. Above three examples shows multi-component diffusion in which the flux of one solute is a function of the gradient of the second solute.

Definition of Multi-component Diffusion

To understand multi-component diffusion, first, we need to discuss binary diffusion briefly because it forms the basis for the multi-component diffusion that is discussed in the rest of this thesis. We begin with Fick's law, which describes the basic relationships in binary diffusion. The diffusion coefficient described by this law is discussed for gases and liquids. Diffusion in solids is not covered because it is not relevant, so, after discussing gases and liquids, the structure of the thesis is presented. Then, multi-component diffusion is addressed, including the optimal control framework for determining multi-component diffusion

1.1.1 The Origin of Fick's Law
Early studies of diffusion were split into studies of gases and liquids. Researchers interested in understanding the behaviors of atoms or molecules were focussed on studying gases. Researchers working in the areas of medicine and physiology wanted to understand biological transport processes, so they focused on the study of liquids, primarily the diffusion of liquids across membranes (Fick, 1995). Let's look briefly at the diffusion of gases and liquids.

1.1.2 Diffusion in Gases
Thomas Graham (1829, 1833) was the first to analyze the diffusion process quantitatively. Most of his research was conducted using the diffusion apparatus shown below in Figure 1.4. As shown in Figure 1.4, Graham's apparatus consisted of a glass tube, one end of which was immersed in water, with the other end closed by a stucco plug. The tube was filled with hydrogen. Initially, the hydrogen diffuses out of the tube through the stucco plug, while air diffuses into the tube from the outside. The flux of hydrogen leaving the tube was not equal to the flux of air entering the tube, so the level of the water in the tube rises during diffusion (Graham, 1833). Graham observed that the rise in the water level in the tube would cause a pressure gradient that would

7

adversely affect the diffusion process. So, Graham lowered the tube in the water so that the water level in the tube would remain constant. So, his experiments had the characteristic of changing the volume of each gas that was originally in the tube. Graham later showed that this change in volume was inversely proportional to the square root of the density of the gas.

Since the change in the volume of the gas in the tube was related to diffusion, Graham stated: "Diffusion or spontaneous intermixture of two gases in contact is effected by an interchange of position on infinitely minute volumes, being, in the case of each gas,
8

inversely proportional to the square root of the density of the gas..." (Graham, 1833). In other words, `Diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight of the gas". Graham's diffusion experiments did not say anything about the diffusion coefficient of the gas. Since there was no pressure difference across the porous plug, the process of diffusion across the porous plug could be easily explained without any need of Fick's law or diffusion coefficients (Masom & and Kronstadt, 1967). This is an example of an isobaric diffusion process rather than the equimolar diffusion process that commonly is used to measure diffusion coefficients. Graham's experiments attracted attention towards diffusion as an interesting molecular process, but he was unable to develop a basic diffusion law.

1.1.3 Diffusion in Liquids
The results of early experiments involving diffusion in liquids were difficult to interpret due to the presence of the membrane in the diffusion process. Fick quoted Von Bruke (1843), a physiologist who used olive oil and turpentine on the opposite sides of the leather membrane and then he measured the change in the volume due to diffusion. This experiment supported the hypothesis of the osmotic effect. But, the presence of the membrane made the analysis of the diffusion process difficult.

9

In 1850 (Graham, 1850), Graham did a remarkable job of clarifying the diffusion process in liquids. To understand the diffusion process in the presence of a membrane, he conducted a series of experiments using the setup shown in Figures 1.5.

Figure 1.5. (a) Diffusion in bottles with salt solution; (b) empty bottle in a jar that contains only water

In the first set of experiments (Figure 1.5a), he connected two bottles that contained salt solutions at different concentrations. After several days, he separated the bottles and analyzed the contents to determine any changes. In the second series of experiments (Figure 1.5b), he placed a salt solution of known concentration in a small bottle and placed that bottle in a jar that contained only water. After several days, he took the bottle out of the jar and analyzed its contents. Based on his experiments, Graham concluded that the diffusion process in liquids is slower than diffusion in gases, and the process of diffusion
10

becomes even slower as the diffusion progresses. After analyzing the results of his experiments, Graham concluded that" the quantities diffused appear to be closely in proportion to the quantity of salt in the diffusion solution" (Graham, 1850). In other words, "...the flux caused by diffusion is proportional to the concentration difference of the salt."

1.1.4 Fick's Law
In 1855, Fick put Graham's experimental results on a quantitative basis. He described the diffusion on the same mathematical basis as Fourier's law of heat conduction or Ohm's Law for electrical conduction. Fick recognized more clearly that diffusion is a dynamic molecular process than Graham did. With this basic hypothesis, Fick developed the laws of diffusion using analogies with Fourier's work. He described a one-dimensional flux, following equation: , by the

(1.1)

where quantity

is the concentration, and

is the distance. This is Fick's law of diffusion. The

, which Fick referred to as the "constant that depends on the nature of the

substance," is also called the diffusion coefficient. Fick used Fourier's development to determine the more general conservation equation:

(
where

)

(1.2)

is the area and is a constant in a given system. So, Equation (1.2) becomes:

11

(

)

(1.3)

Equation (1.3) is the basic equation for one-dimensional, unsteady state diffusion. Later, Fick proved his hypothesis that diffusion and thermal conduction could be described by the same equation. Dense-phase molecular diffusivities are a complex process, and they can be a strong function of composition, temperature, and pressure. Often, they are characterized by the Fick diffusivity, which is a product of the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivity and a thermodynamic, non-ideality factor that is related to the concentration of a chemical species in the medium (E. L. Cussler, 2009). Fick diffusivity is a function of the concentration of the diffusing substance at a given temperature and pressure. This non-ideality is notably present in chemical systems at finite concentrations (Amooghina, et al., 2013; Bouchet et al., 1965; Felder & Huvard, 1980; Ghoreyshi, et al., 2004; Liu, et al., 2011; Moradi Shehni, et al.,2011; Rehfeldt & Stichlmair, 2007; Williams & Cady, 1934). Multi-component diffusivities, i.e., the simultaneous diffusivities of two or more species in a medium, are far more frequent than the diffusion of a single species (E. L. Cussler & Peter, 1966). Binary diffusion can be expressed mathematically as: (1.4) Equation (1.4) is another form of Fick's first law of diffusion. The diffusion coefficient called binary diffusivity and is

(1.5) (1.6) Equations (1.5) and (1.6) show that both fluxes mole-fraction gradients The depend on both of the independent are the multi-component

diffusivities. These four diffusivity coefficients are needed to characterize a ternary system (Taylor & Krishna, 1993). The focus of our study is to determine the matrix of four diffusivities, i.e., , and

, in a system that consisted of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and polystyrene, as shown in Figure 1.6. The diffusion coefficients and are called main diffusion coefficients also and are

known as self-diffusion coefficients. Whereas the diffusion coefficients called cross-diffusion coefficients also known as mutual diffusion coefficients.

There are two kinds of blowing agents that are most commonly used namely; Chemical Blowing Agents and Physical Blowing Agents. Chemical blowing agents are chemical compounds that release gases such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide as a result of chemical reactions. Whereas, physical blowing agents are compounds that release gases as a result of physical processes. Examples of widely used physical blowing agents are chlorofluorocarbons and hydrocarbons. Due to the harsh effect of chlorofluorocarbons on environment, their use is prohibited. However, hydroflourocarbons, hydrocarbons and inert gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen can substitute chlorofluorocarbons. Hydroflourocarbons are expensive and flammable. Whereas, hydrocarbons are highly flammable and volatile in nature. The inert gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen are benign to the environment. The polymer industry is gradually introducing carbon dioxide and nitrogen as a safe and low cost physical blowing agent (Kwag, Manke, & and Gulari, 1999). However, due to the lack of multi-component diffusivity data of carbon dioxide and nitrogen in polymers, the effective design and safe operation of separation and purification processes for polymers is not possible.

Polymer such as polystyrene is colorless, non-toxic, and translucent to transparent solid with a glossy surface, it is mainly used in food packaging and biomedical industry e.g. in petri dishes, injection syringes, electrolyte drips, medical tubing, and in cannula. Where devolatilization and foaming process can be made safe, efficient and economical by using inert gases such as carbon dioxide, and nitrogen.
14

The objective is to develop an optimal control framework to determine experimentally the concentration-dependent diffusivities of gas mixtures in polymers, considering first nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases and polystyrene. The optimal control framework developed in this work will produce much-needed diffusivity data, allowing technological advancements in the Canadian polymer industry and others. Multi-component diffusivity data will enable effective design and safe operation of separation and purification processes for polymers and heavy oil. The polymer industry will benefit by using the diffusivity data in engineering, design, and optimization calculations. Regulatory agencies can use the data to establish standards related to polymer products

LITERATURE REVIEW

Ternary and higher systems are far more frequent than binary systems. However, the diffusivity data of the former are very limited. In the following treatment, we provide a review of recent studies involving multi-component diffusivity. Amooghina et al., 2013, developed a new mathematical model to investigate the permeation of a ternary gas mixture across a synthesized composite

polydimethylsiloxane/aromatic polyamide membrane. The results showed that the diffusivities of hydrogen and methane increased as the feed temperature and fugacity increased, but the diffusivity of propane decreased. Moreover, increasing the concentration of propane improved the diffusion properties of all of the components. The results demonstrated that considering the concentration-dependent system leads to a small deviation of less than 10%, while the concentration-independent system had a large deviation, ranging from 50 to 100%. In addition, the results indicated that diffusivities of the lighter gases were especially affected by their composition, while solubility had a dominant effect on the diffusivities of the heavier gases. Liu et al., 2011, developed an empirical method for predicting multi-component, Maxwell Stefan diffusion in ternary systems accounting for friction between the two diffusing

17

species. They used an n-hexane-cyclohexane-toluene system, and their results showed that their model described the concentration dependence better than other models. In a separate investigation, Rehfeldt & Stichlmair, 2007, studied the diffusivities of liquids, which are of great interest for the calculation and simulation of mass transfer processes. Several prediction models for binary diffusivities can be found in the literature. However, only a few models exist for multi-component systems. Due to lack of data for ternary diffusivities, these models have not been verified for real systems to date. To overcome this limitation, they measured multi-component diffusivities within some concentration range of several ternary systems. Fick diffusivities were transformed to the less concentration-dependent Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities using a thermodynamic correction factor. Four prediction models were tested by comparing their predicted values with the experimental data. In some systems, the predictions of multi-component diffusivities showed promising results. However, the quality of predicted diffusivities depends strongly on an accurate thermodynamic description of the system. Ghoreyshi et al., 2004 used the Maxwell-Stefan formulation of multi-component diffusivities and the basic postulates of irreversible thermodynamics to develop a general model of membrane transport. In principle, the general model is applicable to any separation process that uses a homogeneous, non-porous membrane as the selectiveseparation barrier. Examples of such processes include dialysis, electrodialysis, reverse osmosis, vapor permeation, and evaporation. The predictive capabilities of the general model were tested for the ethanol­water-silicone rubber system. The results obtained

18

indicated that the general model is capable of describing the pervaporation and dialysis performance of the ethanol-water-silicone rubber system with identical sets of concentration-dependent equilibrium and diffusive parameters. They concluded that the concentration dependence of the ternary Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities is described well by a natural extension of the binary relationship to multi-component systems. Bouchet & Mevrel, 2007, developed an inverse numerical analysis that permits the extraction of composition-dependent diffusivities for all of the compositions along a diffusivity path. Its application to various diffusion couples at 1100oC in a nickel-platinumaluminium alloy showed that, in the composition domain investigated, the direct diffusivities increase as the platinum content increases. A concentration gradient of platinum has no influence on the diffusion of aluminium. The cross coefficient was constant and very small. J. L. Duda, Ni, & Vrentas, 1978, showed the general, concentration-dependent behavior of diffusivity. They indicated that diffusivities increase sharply as solvent concentration increases and that they often exhibit maximum values in the concentrated region. At low solvent concentrations, a small increase in the weight fraction of the solvent will cause a very significant increase in the diffusivity (J. L. Duda, 1985). They found that the diffusivity of a solvent in a polymer increases with temperature. A few publications have reported the concentration dependence of dense-phase gas diffusivities. (Li, Liu, Zhao, & Yuan, 2009) studied the solubility and diffusivity of carbon dioxide in isotactic polypropylene. The diffusivity showed a weak dependence on
19

concentration, and it varied by an order of magnitude (from isotactic polypropylene at three different temperatures.

to

m2/s) in

Jitendra, et al., 2009, Kundra, et al., 2011, and Upreti & Mehrotra, 2000 experimentally determined the composition-dependent diffusivity of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in lowdensity polyethylene, polypropylene, and bitumen. Each time, the researchers found that the gas diffusivity was composition-dependent.

2.1 Lack of Data for Ternary System
There are no publications that report experimental diffusivities for ternary systems comprised of two gases and a dense phase. A few experimental studies have investigated only liquid phases. For example, Telis, Murarif. R.C.B.D.L., & Yamashita, 2004, studied solutions of NaCl and sucrose for the osmotic pre-treatment of tomato quarters. The maximum loss of moisture occurred when the osmotic treatment was conducted in a more concentrated solution, and this observation was independent of the type of solute. The apparent diffusion coefficients for water, NaCl, and sucrose were calculated at 30 ±1°C, and they were found to be in the range of to m2/s.

Lin, et al.,, 2009, reported the ternary diffusivities of diethanolamine and Nethyldiethanolamine in aqueous solutions of these two compounds. The main diffusivities (D11 and D22) and the cross-diffusivities (D12 and D21) were reported as functions of the temperature and concentration of the alkanolamines. They found that the ratio of D 12 to
20

D11 was greater than the ratio of D21 to D22. The diffusion coefficients were on the order of m2/s. The researchers also found that the main diffusivities increased as temperature increased at a constant concentration of the solvent. But the diffusivities decreased with the concentration at constant temperature. Kjetil, et al., 2006, studied a system consisting of toluene, chloroform, and benzene. They determined the concentration-dependent molecular diffusion coefficient to be on the order of m2/s.

Our extensive literature survey showed that limited data are available concerning the dependence of diffusivity on concentration. The theoretical prediction of diffusivity relies on the self-diffusivities of the solvent, and these values usually are not available. In addition, the accurate prediction of the concentration-dependent chemical potential of solvents is needed (J. L. Lundberg, et al., 1962; J. L. Lundberg, et al., 1963; J. L. Lundberg, 1964a; J. L. Lundberg, 1964b; J. L. Lundberg, et al., 1960). These limitations necessitate the determination of concentration dependent diffusivities. Table 2.1 summarizes the previous work done by other researchers in determining the diffusivities of carbon dioxide and nitrogen in polystyrene.

Our plan is to develop an optimal control framework to determine diffusivity versus concentration surfaces in ternary systems of two gases and a liquid. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an optimal control framework novel method for the experimental determination of multi-component diffusivities for a ternary system of two gases and one non-volatile, dense phase. The novel feature of this work is that it allows the natural evolution of multi-component diffusivity verses concentration in agreement with experimental data and subject to the detailed mathematical model. This is an inverse problem that can be solved using the principles of optimal control. In our study, principles of optimal control is used to extract the optimal, compositiondependent, multi-component diffusivities (system property) as a function of another system property (composition).

2.2

Optimal Control

Optimization is a method of finding the conditions that give maximum or minimum value of a function. But, if optimization involves minimization or maximization of a functional subject to some constraint, the decision variable will not be a number, but will be a function. Such problems are called optimal control problems. A functional is defined as a function of several other functions. Optimal control problems involve two kinds of variables: state and control variables. These variables are usually related to each other by a

23

set of differential equations. Optimal control theory can be used to solve such problems (Upreti, 2013). An optimal control technique solves the problem in number of stages, where each stage develops from the preceding stage in prescribed manner. The control variables define the system that governs the advancement of the system from one stage to the next. The state variables describe the behaviour or status of the system at any stage. So, optimal control problem is to find a set of control variables so that the total objective functional over all the stages is optimized subject to a set of constraints (e.g. differential equation) on the control and state variables. Optimal control determines a control policy for a system that will maximize or minimize a specific performance criterion subject to constrains. Optimal control has applications in many different fields, including aerospace, process control, and engineering. In early 1950s due to the lack of fast computers only simple optimal control problems could be solved. The revolution of the digital computers in the 1950s, allows the application of optimal control theory and methods to solve complex optimal control problems. Many applications of optimal control theory were developed to optimization surfactant flooding process, polymer process, and miscible carbon dioxide process (Ramirez, 1987). Although only initial studies are present, promising advances are expected in the application of optimal control theory. A branch of mathematics that is useful in solving optimal control problems is the calculus of variations (Denn, 1969; Kirk, 1970; Ray, 1981). Calculus of variations deals with functionals,
24

or functions whose independent variables are functions themselves. To solve optimal control problems where the objective is to determine a function that minimize or maximize a specified functional, calculus of variations is a useful technique. The analogous problem in calculus is to determine a point that yields the minimum or maximum value of a function. The variation plays the same role in determining extreme values of functionals as the differential does in finding maxima and minima of functions. The fundamental theorem used in finding extreme values of a function is the necessary condition that the differential vanishes at an extreme point. In variational problems, the analogous theorem is that the variation must be zero on an extrema. Consider following simple example of optimal control in which functionals are formed as integrals involving an unknown function and its derivatives:

cannot be varied arbitrary because they are tied together in the differential objective functional. According to optimal control theory, if the variations are arbitrary their coefficients are individually zero. But in this case this is not possible because the control and the state variable are tied together. This problem can be solved by introducing an undetermined function, functional defined as   , called Lagrange multiplier, in the augmented objective

To solve an optimal control problem, we must first describe the problem in physical terms, and then translate the physical description into mathematical terms. Once the optimal problem is defined mathematically, we can apply the optimal control theory to the partial differential equations describing the process model.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

This chapter describes the experimental setup used for determining the concentration dependent multi-component diffusivities of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in polystyrene. Figure 3.1 shows the experimental setup used to determine the concentration-dependent diffusivities of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in polystyrene. The setup was used to conduct two kinds of experiments, i.e., solubility experiments and diffusion experiments. The purpose of the solubility experiments was to determine the equilibrium concentration of each gas at the gas­polymer interface as a function of pressure and gas-phase composition. This information provides the boundary condition for the mass transfer model of the diffusion process. The latter is conducted in diffusion experiments to furnish experimental pressure and gas-phase composition as a function of time. Figure 3.1 shows the main parts of the setup. It consists of a diffusion cell with a concentric, 4-cm-diameter cylindrical slot at the bottom to hold a polymer sample.

In an experiment, a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide was allowed to diffuse into the polymer layer inside a closed diffusion cell at a constant temperature. The dimensions of the diffusion vessel are given in Table 3.1 Table 3.1 Diffusion vessel dimensions and material Diameter Volume Depth Mass of Polystyrene Density of Polystyrene Carbon dioxide Nitrogen Polystyrene Obtained from MEGS specialty gases and equipment, Montreal (99.9 % pure) Sigma Aldrich (99.9% pure) 0.02 m 0.04 m

The lid of the diffusion cell had a glass window that allowed a complete view of the surface of the polymer to an external, online, Keyence LKG displacement laser sensor, which tracked the polymer's surface. The laser beam detects any displacement in the thickness of the polymer. The laser sensor has an accuracy of 10 µm that could lead to an error of 1.2%. In our experiments, as expected, the laser sensor did not detect any change in the thickness of the polymer because the experiments were done at room temperature (230C) and low pressure. Figure 3.2 shows constant temperature inside the polymer during
30

diffusion experiment. Figure 3.3 shows constant thickness of the polymer layer during the diffusion experiment. To ensure that there is no change in the polymer's temperature during the diffusion process, we inserted a thermocouple in the polymer through the glass lid, as shown in the Figure 3.4(b). The thermocouple used was an H1 Series thermocouple that was obtained from Nanmac Corporation, USA. In our experiments, the thermocouple did not detect any change in the temperature of the polymer. The accuracy of the thermocouple was ±0.05 that could generate the error of 0.2% at 25 0C.

Figure 3.4(a) shows a digital picture of the laser sensor connected to the diffusion system. A Teflon core composite Viton O-ring was used between the lid and the lower part of the diffusion cell to seal the cell. The gas cylinder was used to store the gas that was obtained from an external tank. The pressure in the diffusion cell was measured by a Paroscientific Digiquartz intelligent pressure transmitter, which was connected to the tube between valves A and B to record the pressure inside the diffusion cell. To maintain isothermal diffusion, the entire setup was placed inside an oven.

32

Prior to the experiment, the experimental setup was tested for leaks for 2 h at the temperature of the experiment by pressurizing it to 1.5 times the pressure used in the experiment. After the system was pressurized, the tests were conducted with valves A and C closed and valve B open. After the test, valve C was opened to depressurize the system, and polystyrene granules were placed in the sample slot and by gradually raising the temperature to form a cylindrical layer. Figure 3.5 shows the polystyrene layer that was formed after the granules were gradually melted and then cooled to 23oC. The

experimental setup was allowed to cool for one day, after which valve C was closed, and the laser sensor was positioned and calibrated to track the movement of the pol ymer's surface.

The experiments were conducted at 23oC, and the temperature was controlled within ±0.5oC of the desired value. The gaseous mixture was introduced and only valve E and C were closed. Initial sample of the gaseous mixture was withdrawn from valve F. Valve F is then closed and the experiment was initiated by introducing the gas quickly above the polymer's surface inside the diffusion cell by simultaneously opening valve E and closing valve A. The pressure inside the cell was recorded as the gas diffused gradually into the polymer layer. The pressure sensor had a resolution of ±0.006 kPa. To withdraw final sample valve D is closed and the sample is withdrawn from valve F. To determine gas solubility and diffusion, the experiment was conducted until no further reduction in the pressure could be discerned. That was the time when the mass fraction of the gas in the polymer sample tended to have a uniform equilibrium value. The

experiment was terminated by gradually opening valve C to release the gas. After the completion of each run, the gas was removed from the apparatus by a vacuum pump. After the vacuum pump had removed the gas, it was turned off, and the pressure was allowed to stabilize. The vacuum pump was operated a few times to ensure that all of the gas in the polymer and in the gas phase had been removed. Then, the second run was begun using the same steps described above. A magnetic micro mixing fan was affixed beneath the lid of the diffusion cell to homogenize the gas phase. The minimum speed that could be achieved for magnetic micro mixing was 30 revolutions per minute and this speed was used throughout our experiments. Another reason for rotating the fan at lower speed is to avoid any convection and bulk motion. Also

34

at higher fan speed there would be work done by the fan inside the pressure vessel that could increase the temperature of the gas phase and the polymer. This magnetic micro mixing fan obviates the need for an additional mass transfer model for the gas phase. The speed of the magnetic micro mixing fa Figure 3.6 shows a schematic diagram of the fan, which was made by gluing aluminum strips to the bar of a magnetic stirrer at an angle of 45o. The magnetic micro mixing fan was attached to the base of the lid of the cell.

3.1 Solubility Experiments
Different initial ratios of the two gases and different initial pressures were used, and the diffusion of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in polystyrene was conducted until there was no detectable change in pressure inside the diffusion cell, which took an extended period of time (1­2 days). The final pressures were recorded, and gas-phase samples were extracted at the beginning and end of the experiment and analyzed using a gas chromatograph to determine the initial and final gas compositions. Five solubility experiments were conducted with different initial compositions in the gas phase. The plots of the solubility experiments are given in Appendix A.

The purpose of these experiments was to determine the interfacial (equilibrium) concentration of nitrogen and carbon dioxide at the gas­polymer interface as a function of pressure and gas-phase composition:

3.3 Analysis of Gas Phase Composition

The gas-phase composition during the diffusion and solubility experiments was analyzed by a gas chromatograph. Now, the gas chromatograph is introduced briefly, including how it works, how the samples were extracted during the solubility and diffusion experiments, the column used in this study, and the gas chromatography method that was used in the analysis of the composition of the gas phase. A succinct introduction of the gas chromatograph (GC) follows.

3.3.1 Gas Chromatography
Chromatography is the separation of a mixture of compounds (solutes) into separate components, making it easier to identify (qualitate) and measure (quantitate) each component. GC is one of several chromatographic techniques. It is appropriate for
38

analyzing 10­20% of all known compounds. To be suitable for GC analysis, a compound must have sufficient volatility and thermal stability. If all or some of a compound's molecules are in the gas phase at 400­450 oC or below and they do not decompose at these temperatures, the compound probably can be analyzed by GC.

3.3.2 Chromatogram
The size of the peak corresponds to the amount of the compound of interest in the sample.
As the amount of the compound of interest increases in the samples being analyzed, larger peaks are attained for that compound. Retention time is the time it takes for a compound to travel

through the column. If the column and all operating conditions are kept constant, a given compound will always have the same retention time. Peak size and retention time are used for quantitative and qualitative analyses of a compound, respectively. However, the identification of a compound cannot be determined solely by its retention time. A known amount of an authentic, pure sample of the compound must first be analyzed to determine its retention time and peak size. Then, this value is compared to the results from an unknown sample to determine whether the target compound is present (by comparing retention times) and in what quantity (by comparing peak size). In this study, thermal conductivity detector was used. Thermal conductivity detector relies on the thermal conductivity of matter passing around a tungsten-rhenium filament with a
39

current traveling through it. In this set up helium is used as a carrier gas because of their relatively high thermal conductivity which keep the filament cool and maintain uniform resistivity and electrical efficiency of the filament. However, when analyte molecules elute from the column, mixed with carrier gas, the thermal conductivity decreases and this causes a detector response. The response is due to the decreased thermal conductivity causing an increase in filament temperature and resistivity resulting in fluctuations in voltage. Detector sensitivity is proportional to filament current while it is inversely proportional to the immediate environmental temperature of that detector as well as flow rate of the carrier gas. A Varian gas chromatograph, model CP3800, with Galaxie V1.9 software, was used to determine the amounts of carbon dioxide and nitrogen in the sample obtained from the diffusion cell. The column HP-Plot Q, obtained from Agilent Technologies Canada, was used for the detection of eluents from the gas chromatograph. The inner diameter of the column was 0.32 mm, and the length of the column was 15 m. The stationary phase in the column was polystyrene divinyl benzene.

3.3.3 Sampling
A gas-tight, high-performance, micro syringe with a volume of 1,000 µL, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, was used to draw the samples from the sampling nozzle. The sample in the syringe was injected manually into the gas chromatograph column for detection.
40

Before we used the GC to determine the experimental masses of nitrogen and carbon dioxide absorbed in the polystyrene, we ran pure samples of nitrogen and carbon dioxide with different initial volumes. Then the areas under the peaks were plotted against the volume of the samples. The best straight-line fit of the data was determined and for use in determining the composition of these two gases in the unknown sample. The curve-fitting plots are provided in Appendix B. During the solubility and diffusion experiments, 200µL samples were injected manually through the GC sample inlet at 240oC. The retention time was determined by a thermal conductivity detector that was maintained at 240oC. Helium was used as the carrier gas (mobile phase). The flow rate of the mobile phase was 8.6 mL/min. The oven that housed the GC column was maintained at 35oC. Using the measured composition of the gas phase, we calculated the experimental mass of each gas absorbed in the polystyrene at the time when the samples were extracted. The detailed calculation is given in Appendix B.

4 THEORY and COMPUTATION
This chapter presents the development of optimal control framework to determine concentration dependent multicomponent diffusivities of two gases in a non-volatile dense phase, which is the primary objective of this study. Interfacial gas mass fractions of two gases versus time are used as control in this optimal control problem. The optimal diffusivities are then determined that minimises the error between the experimental the calculated gas mass absorbed. The optimal control framework to determine the concentration dependent

multicomponent diffusivities is based on detailed mass transfer model, which comprises continuity equation of diffusion. Optimal control principles are applied to derive necessary conditions for which the error between the experimental and calculated gas mass absorbed is minimum. A numerical algorithm is developed to estimate the optimal ternary diffusivities.

4.1 Mass Transfer Model
The mathematical model was based on the following assumptions: 1. Mass transfer is along the depth of the dense phase.

42

The polymer is in the pressure-decay vessel and only its surfaces are exposed to the diffusing gases. The other three sides of the polymer are adhered to the base or the walls of the pressure-decay vessel. Based on these facts, it can be assumed that the diffusion of the gases in the polymer melt is only in the downward direction (z-direction). Hence, it is a unidirectional diffusion process. 2. No chemical reactions occur in the pressure vessel. The absorption of the gases in the polymer melt is purely a physical phenomenon. There are no reactions among carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and the polymer melt at the temperature and pressure of the experiment. 3. Diffusion occurs at constant temperature. While the diffusion of the gases is occurring, the temperature of the pressure-decay system and its components does not change. (This assumption inherently means that any thermal energy released during the diffusion is dissipated instantaneously to the surroundings 4. There is no convection in the dense, non-volatile phase. The rotation of magnetic micro mixer was kept low at 30 rpm. Hence, it is assumed that there is no diffusion due to convection or bulk motion in the gas phase due to the rotation of the magnetic micro mixer inside the pressure-decay vessel. Also, at this low rotational speed, the work done by the magnetic micro mixer does not affect the temperature inside the pressure-decay vessel. 5. The wall effects are negligible. It is assumed that the permeating gases (carbon dioxide and nitrogen) move only along the z-direction i.e., the depth of the polymer.

43

6. The pressure decay is solely due to the diffusion of the gases and there is no leakage. Before the experiment was started, it was ensured that the pressure-decay equipment had no leaks. Hence, it is assumed that the decrease in the pressure is solely due to diffusion. 7. The gas phase is homogenous at all times. Since the magnetic micro mixer was constantly moving at slow speed above the surface of the polymer. So, it is assumed that the gas phase is homogenous at all times.

Figure 4.1 shows the diffusion of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in polystyrene. Dark colored circles represent carbon dioxide and the white color circles represent nitrogen. The two gases diffuse in the polymer of depth of z. The diffusivity of the two gases is a function of the mass fraction of the two gases .

4.2 Theoretical Model Development
Considering the assumptions mentioned above, the mass transfer model is presented below. We use subscripts `1' and `2' for the nitrogen and carbon dioxide respectively, and `3' for the non-volatile phase. For the first gas:
1 N 1   0, t z

(4.1)

where 1 is the mole fraction of the first gas, and N1 is the mass flux of that gas, both in the underlying layer of the dense, non-volatile phase; the flux is given by:
N1  1 N1  1 N 2  1 N 3  J 1

(4.2)

where N 2 and N 3 are the mass flux of the second gas and the dense non-volatile phase, respectively. Since N 3 is zero, Equation (4.2) becomes:
N1  1 N1  1 N 2  J D

(4.3)

where J 1 is the diffusive flux for the first gas, and it is given by:
J D   D11 1 2  D12 z z

(4.4)

Similarly for the second gas, we have

To determine the concentration-dependent, multicomponent diffusivities using our mass transfer model, we conducted two kinds of experiments, i.e., solubility experiments and

diffusion experiments. The purpose of the solubility experiments was to determine the equilibrium concentration of each gas at the gas­polymer interface as a function of pressure and gas-phase composition. This provided the boundary conditions. The purpose of the diffusion experiments was to obtain data for pressure and the gas-phase composition as a function of time. These data provided the experimental mass of each gas absorbed in the dense phase. To solve our mass transfer model, the four unknown diffusivities, and

are required. This is an inverse problem that can be solved using the optimal control technique.

4.3

Optimal Control

An optimal control involves the improvement in the system's performance as a function of time, space, or any other independent variable. In our study, the optimal control technique was used to extract the optimal, composition-dependent, multi-component diffusivities (system property) as a function of another system property (composition). Unknown diffusivities are control surfaces that must be optimally determined such that the difference between the experimental and calculated masses is minimized. The error function is the objective function that is described next (Upreti, 2013).

51

4.4 The Objective Functional
The goal is to determine the unknown, concentration-dependent, multi-component diffusivities of the two gases in the non-volatile dense phase such that their use in equations (4.19) to (4.22) yields the calculated masses of the gases in the layer that are in agreement with experimentally-determined masses of the gases, i.e., m1exp (t) and m 2exp (t) through gas chromatograph and pressure decay measurements. The objective functional can be expressed as the summation of:

I 1   m1 mod t   m1 exp t  dt
T 2 0

(4.23)

and

I 2   m2 mod t   m2 exp t  dt
T 2 0

(4.24)

where I1 and I 2 are the measures of error between the predicted and experimental gas masses for the respective gases over time T.

At any given time, m1 mod t  and m1 mod t  are the model-predicted mass of gases absorbed in the polymer, whereas, m1exp t  and m 2exp t  are the experimental-determined gas masses absorbed in the polymer. The model-predicted mass of each gas absorbed is given by:

m1 mod   1 Adz and, m2 mod   2 Adz

Thus,

I  I1  I 2    (1 Adz  m1exp )2  (2 Adz  m2 exp )2  dt

(4.26)

where L is the depth of the polymer phase having a cross-sectional area A. Note that is given by the highly non-linear, partial differential Equations (4.17) and (4.18), having diffusivities dimensional surfaces to be optimally determined. The optimal control problem is to determine these functions that minimizes given by as the two-

Equation (4.26) subject to the satisfaction of differential equation constraints. So, Equation (4.17) can also be written as:

 G1(z,t) 

1 1 2  2 1  2 2    f1   ,  , , , 2 , ,D11 ,D12 ,D21 ,D22  1 2 2  0 t z z z z  
(4.27)

For the second gas, Equation (4.18) can be written as:
G2(z,t)  2 1 2  2 1  2 2    f2   ,  , , , 2 , ,D11 ,D12 ,D21 ,D22  1 2 2  0 t z z z z  

(4.28)

In the next section, we derive necessary condition for J to be at its minimum value. The solution of necessary conditions will yield the unknown concentration dependent multicomponent diffusivities.

4.5 Necessary Condition for the Minimum
The necessary condition for the minimum is that the variation of J is zero, i.e.:
T L 00

J  I1  I 2    (1G1  1G1 2 G2  2 G2 )dzdt  0

(4.43) Similarly, J 2 can be derived by interchanging subscripts 1 and 2 in Equation (4.43). Because the initial mass concentration of the gas in the polymer is known at the interface and is zero everywhere in the polymer, the variation 1 ( z,0) and  2 ( z,0) is zero for all

57

values of

z.

Since the final mass concentration of the gas is not specified, the fourth

integral in Equation (4.43) is eliminated by forcing:

i(z,T)  0

0 z  L

(4.44)

Since the equilibrium concentration of gas at the interface [1 (0, t)  1sat (t)] and

[ 2 (0, t)   2 sat (t)] is always specified, 1or2 (0, t) is zero. Therefore, the third and fifth
integrals are eliminated in Equation (4.43). Furthermore, by forcing:

i (L,t)  0

0t T
(4.45)

i ( 0,t)  0

0t T
(4.46)

the sixth terms in equation (4.43) are eliminated. Similarly variation of gas 2 J 2 can also be
simplified. Simplifying and rearranging Equation (4.35), we get:

Equation (4.44) is the initial condition for Equations (4.48) and (4.49), and Equations (4.45) and (4.46) are its two boundary conditions. Equations (4.48) and (4.49) are also called costate equations. Hence, subject to Equations (4.48) and (4.49), Equation (4.47) can be simplified to:

f f f  f 1  D11  1 1 D12  1 1 D21  1 1 D22    1 T L D12 D21 D22  D11  J      dzdt  0 0 0 f 2 f 2 f 2 f 2   2 D D11  2 D D12  2 D D21  2 D D22   11 12 21 22  

(4.50)

since Dij , where i, j  1,2 are arbitrary, their coefficients must be individually equal to zero.
Thus, at the minimum of J , the variational derivative of J with respect to , is zero, i.e.,:

and

 f 1 f 2    1 D  2 D  0 11 11  
 f 1 f 2   1 D  2 D 12 12    0

The negative of the variational derivative provides the gradient correction for

Dij(1 ,2 ) in the

iterative minimization of J . To summarize, Equations (4.44-4.46), (4.48-4.49), and (4.51-4.54)

form the set of necessary conditions. The detailed derivation for the derivatives of the terms

4.6 Computational Algorithm

Based on the necessary conditions for the minimum of the objective functional, the following computational algorithm was developed to determine the concentrationdependent, multi-component diffusion coefficients. 1 Step A: Initialize and and . Four initial estimates of diffusivities, i.e.

, were provided to initialize the program.

2 Step B: Simultaneously integrate the state equations (model) subject to the initial and boundary conditions, to obtain the values of for each node. To implement the

numerical solution, the state equations were expressed in finite-difference form along z direction. The model of the diffusion cell was divided into equal-spaced grid points in the z direction. In this way, each state equation was transformed into a set of simultaneous ordinary differential equations. The fifth-order, adaptive-step method of Runge-Kutta-

77

Fehlberg was used with Cash-Karp parameters to achieve an accurate solution with minimum computational effort. The values of state variables( each grid point in the space of t and z are saved. 3 Step D: Evaluate the objective functional. 4 If there is no difference between the calculated mass and the experimental mass of the gases absorbed then STOP, otherwise go the next step. 5 Step E: Integrate the costate equations backward, subject to the final boundary conditions, using stored values of to get the values of  at each grid point. The and ), at

costate equations must be solved backward in the time domain. Since they are dependent on concentration, they can be only solved after solving the state equation in the forward direction in the time domain. The solution of these equations provides the variational derivatives to be used in the next step. 6 Step F: Improve using the gradient correction. at each grid point in the time interval

7 Obtain the new and improved values of using the variational derivative as follows:
where

and

is a small positive number whose optimal

value provides maximum reduction in the objective functional. Using , repeat the computations Step 2 onward until there is no further improvement

in the objective functional. When the improvement is negligible, the values are optimal.

78

The variational derivatives were used in conjunction with the Broyden­Fletcher­Goldfarb­ Shanno algorithm (BFGS) method to improve the diffusivities. The optimal control algorithm was programmed in C++. Figure 4.2 shows the computational algorithm. The architecture of the computer program that was used to estimate optimal values of concentration dependent multi-component diffusivities is shown in Figure 4.3. The computer program is divided in five main Blocks, namely: A, B, C, D and E. We will discuss these Blocks briefly. Block A includes the main file of the program that consists of Broyden­ Fletcher­Goldfarb­Shanno algorithm (BFGS) and model class. The BFGS is gradient improvement method. Model class solves the mathematical model. Model class is connected to the Block B that contains the mass transfer model, experimental results and the input file that contains various information incluing diffusivity guesses, number of grid points, step size, tolerance, molecular weight of the polymer, polymer density etc. When the program executes, the model class solves the differential equations i.e. state equations (in forwards direction) in Block B using fifth -order adaptive-step method of Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg with Cash-Karp parameters method and the information in the input file. Once the differential equations are solved, the programme calculates the difference between the calculated gas mass absorbed and the experimental gas mass absorbed in Block C using composite Simpson 1/3 and Simpson 1/8 integration rule. Next, the program solves the costate equations (in backward direction), in Block B, using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg fifth order method and the results obtained by solving the state equation previously.

Based on the difference between the calculated gas mass absorbed and the experimental gas mass absorbed the program makes the use of variational derivatives and modify the diffusivity estimate using Krig in Block D. Krig is a 3D interpolation method. The BFGS uses all the above information via model class and minimizes the difference between the calculated gas mass absorbed and the experimental gas mass absorbed. The results are printed in Block E. The above process continues until difference between the calculated gas mass absorbed and the experimental gas mass absorbed is minimum. The C++ codes for calculating variational derivatives and the improvement in the diffusivity values are given in appendix C. The results obtained in this study are presented in the next chapter.

5 RESULTS and DISCUSSION
Since this work is a first step towards developing an optimal control framework to determine concentration dependent multi-component diffusivities so we decided to work at room temperature (23oC) and a pressure of 224 kPa. Using the aforementioned experiments and calculations, we determined the concentration-dependent multicomponent diffusivities and solubility of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in polystyrene. The algorithm developed in Chapter 3 was used to determine the concentration-dependent, multi-component diffusivities. The parameters used in the calculations are provided in Table 5.1 Table 5.1 Parameters used in calculating diffusivities Parameters Mass of polymer Density of the polymer Diameter of the polymer sample Thickness of the polymer sample Number of vs. points Number of grid points along the z direction Value

To arrive at the optimal diffusivities we provided different diffusivities guesses, the computer program was run and the improvement in the objective functional, and the concentration dependant diffusivities obtained were recorded. Approximately, hundreds of
83

trials were run with different diffusivities guesses and only few selected that have shown good improvement in the objective functional are shown in Table 5.2. The dimension of the diffusivities in Table 5.2 is . The best improvement is seen in trial 117 and was

considered to be the final result. Table 5.2 shows that by increasing the number of grid points the improvement in the objective function was reduced.

During the diffusion experiments, the diffusion of carbon dioxide was found to be more compared to the diffusion of nitrogen. This is in accordance with the previous findings

90

where optimal control technique was used and carbon dioxide is found to have higher diffusion compared to nitrogen (Kundra et al., 2011). Figures 5.4 and 5.5 show the interfacial mass concentration of nitrogen and carbon dioxide versus time. Figure 5.4 and 5.5 shows as the diffusion process progresses, the mass fraction of carbon dioxide reduces gradually at the surface of the polystyrene due to more diffusion of carbon dioxide compared to nitrogen. On the other hand, the amount of nitrogen increases gradually at the surface of polystyrene due to the less diffusion of nitrogen compared to carbon dioxide.

The ratio of cross diffusion coefficient of nitrogen nitrogen varies from to

of carbon dioxide to

to the main diffusion coefficient of carbon dioxide

. It can be concluded that, for the diffusion of nitrogen (a smaller due to the concentration

molecule than carbon dioxide), the cross diffusion coefficient

gradient of carbon dioxide is smaller than that for the cross diffusion coefficient of carbon

96

dioxide (a larger molecule)

due to the concentration gradient of nitrogen (a smaller

molecule), as shown in Figures 5.10 and 5.11. Our findings are in accordance with the findings of E. L. Cussler & Breuer, 1972, where acetone a smaller molecule, dragged the bigger molecule, sodium sulfate, and resulted in increased diffusion of sodium sulfate (bigger molecule). But these results are in contrast to the findings of Lin et al., 2009, they found that the diffusion of di-ethanol amine (a smaller molecule, compared to methyl di-ethanol amine), the cross-diffusion effect ( ) due to the concentration gradient of methyl di-ethanol

amine is larger than that for the diffusion of methyl di-ethanol amine (a larger molecule) (D21) due to the concentration gradient of di-ethanol amine (a smaller molecule). Since multi-component diffusion is a complex process, further study is needed on the effect of molecular size, polarity, kinetic energy of molecules, dipole moment, density, viscosity, temperature, and pressure on multi-component diffusion. In general, the diffusivity of carbon dioxide in polystyrene was found to be greater than that of nitrogen, which was in accordance with the findings of other researchers who used carbon dioxide and nitrogen separately in polypropylene and LDPE systems (Jitendra et al., 2009; Kundra et al., 2011).

5.1 Diffusivity Correlations
To develop a mathematical correlation for diffusivity as a function of gas composition, we used Table curve 3D software developed by (SYSTAT Software, Inc.). The results shown in Figures 5.6-5.9 were fitted, and the best functions with the fewest parameters are given in Equations (5.1-5.4).

The variables

Table 5.3 lists all the fitting parameters and details for Equations (5.1-5.4). The mass of absorbed gases predicted by Equations (5.1-5.4) agrees well with that based on the optimally-determined diffusivity and the experimental data.

5.2 Sensitivity Analysis
The final results obtained in this study were tested for sensitivity of the initial diffusivities guesses. They were varied by ± 3% to find the effect on the final results. The results are summarized in Table 5.4. The plots are given in Appendix D. It was found that the trend of diffusivities stays the same and the maximum values do not change by more than 10%.

6 CONCLUSIONS and
RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1 CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we derived a detailed, dynamic, mass-transfer model of the experimental diffusion process for the polymer phase to provide the temporal masses of gases in the polymer during the diffusion experiments. Due to the presence of highly non-linear partial differential equations, the analytical solution to this problem is not possible. Therefore, the optimal control strategy was used to solve this problem numerically. For this purpose an optimal control framework was developed to determine multicomponent concentration dependent diffusivities. Necessary conditions were determined at which the error between the calculated and experimental gas masses was minimized. The satisfaction of these conditions determines the unknown diffusivities. Then, these conditions were used to develop an optimal control frame work. The above optimal control framework was applied to the ternary system of nitrogen (1) and carbon dioxide (2) in polystyrene (3) at room temperature (23oC) and a pressure of 224 kPa. Solubility and diffusion experiments data were used along with the detailed mass

6.2 RECOMMENDATIONS
This work was a first step towards producing the important, fundamental diffusivity data that are required for chemical industries. Optimal control framework developed in this study can be used to generate concentration dependent multicomponent diffusivity data for two gases and a liquid. Future experiments can be done with different gases and polymers at different temperatures and pressures.
