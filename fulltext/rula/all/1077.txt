Abstract
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) 0157:H7 is a gastrointestinal pathogen which causes hemorrhagic colitis and can lead to neurological damage, acute kidney failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome) and vascular lesions. During intestinal colonization EHEC is exposed to a variety of stresses including bile salts (BS) in the small intestine and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the large intestine; little is known about how these stresses affect this pathogen's virulence properties. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of exposure of E. coli 0157:H7 to physiologically relevant concentrations of BS and SCFA alone and in mixtures on bacterial survival, verotoxin production and adhesion to human epithelial cells. The results indicated that BS treatments significantly enhanced several virulence properties including survival and adhesion to human epithelial cell lines including colonic epithelial cells. Verotoxin

production was not affected by any of the BS treatments. Bacterial pretreatment with erythromycin at a sub-minimal inhibitory concentration eliminated the adhesion enhancement after BS treatment, suggesting that protein synthesis was required for enhanced adhesion of BS treated organisms. Using the isogenic mutant of the known adhesins, intimin and iha it was established that there was no role for intimin or iha in the BS-induced adhesion enhancement. SCFA treatments reduced bacterial viability but significantly enhanced both adhesion to human epithelial cells and verotoxin production. The results of this research indicate that ingestion stresses such as BS and SCF A, which are part of the host's natural chemical assault on foreign organisms, may actually enhance the virulence properties of this pathogen and contribute to, rather than, prevent infection. Furthermore, they suggest that this pathogen may use these ingestion stresses to cue the expression of numerous virulence factors for successful infection of local

microenvironments.

1 Introduction

1.1 Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are food-borne pathogens which primarily colonize the human intestinal tract. They are Gram-negative bacteria that

belong to the Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) family. EHEC can cause a wide range of illnesses ranging from mild diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis (HC) which can progress to several life threatening diseases including hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpoura (Wells eta/., 2008). E. coli strain 0157:H7, designated by the somatic antigen 0 and the flagellar antigen H, was first recognized as a pathogen in 1982. It is the most well studied serotype of the group since it is most commonly associated with severe EHEC infections and also has been linked to outbreaks of illness worldwide. EHEC infections lead to a high proportion of deaths due to HUS (with mortality rate of this complication of 3-17o/o), and cause a great deal of morbidity with many surviving individuals experiencing chronic renal insufficiency and neurological damage (Nataro & Kaper, 1998). The production of Shiga toxin (Stx) and the presence of a pathogenicity island that encodes the locus of enterocytes effacement (LEE) are virulence factors that enable E.

coli 015 7 :H7, to cause the severe gastrointestinal infections with the potential lifethreatening complications (Wells et a/., 2008). Nonpathogenic E. coli strains do not possess these genetic characteristics that may contribute to specific virulence traits or to successful survival and fitness of the bacteria in the host (Hacker & Kaper, 2000). Cattle have been identified as the most important reservoir ofEHEC/STEC (Naylor eta/., 2003; Low et a/., 2006). Common routes of transmission include fecal transmission and

contaminated food or water (Caprioli eta!., 2005; Ceponis eta/., 2005). Although most outbreaks are associated with undercooked ground beef, recently many of sources of infection have originated from vegetables including lettuce, spinach, cabbage, sprouts or tomatoes (Borczyk et a!., 1987). Other outbreaks have also been reported after the consumption of contaminated fruits, water or among persons visiting farms, petting zoos

1

and via direct contact in hospital and daycare settings (Louie et al., 2000). EHEC is a highly efficient pathogen in humans since the infective dose is estimated to be only approximately 50-100 organisms (Griffin and Miner, 1995). The ability of EHEC to persistently colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GI) relies on its capability to sense and respond to many stressful environments (Maroncle et al., 2006). E. coli 0157 :H7 attachment to the epithelial cells is the first critical step in colonization and is mediated by bacterial adhesins. In order to colonize the human colon, EHEC initially adheres nonintimately, followed by intimate attachment to the host cell (Torres et al., 2005b). It has been proposed that initial attachment of EHEC to the epithelial cells is mediated by EspA filaments as well as fimbria! adhesions, including LP fimbriae (Kenny, 1999). The Esp effector proteins and transmembrane intimin receptor (Tir) are translocated via the multicomponent apparatus type III secretion system (TTSS) into the human host. This initial adherence of the bacteria to the target cells is followed by the intimate attachment which is associated with the binding of the bacterial adhesin intimin to the Tir (Kenny, 1999). The ability of E. coli 0157:H7 to promote the development of attaching and effacing (AlE) lesions has been attributed to the presence of a pathogenicity island on the bacterial genome. The LEE pathogenicity island encodes the genes products responsible for the generation of AlE lesions on intestinal epithelial cells (Elhanafi et al., 2004 ). Apart from the LEE encoded proteins, several adhesins including adherence conferring molecule (lha) (Tarr et al., 2000), long polar fimbriae (lpf) (Torres et al., 2002), curli (Uhlich et al., 2001) and F9 fimbriae (Dziva et al., 2004; Low et al., 2006) are associated with adherence to mammalian cells. The production of Stx (verocytotoxin) is one the major virulence characteristics of EHEC since the toxins are associated with development of HC and HUS due to EHEC infections (Law, 2000; Caprioli et a!., 2005). HUS arises as a consequence_ of microvascular disease triggered by the toxins entering the bloodstream and binding to the receptor Gb3 of kidney and brain cells (Spear et al., 2006). In spite of significant advances made in understanding EHEC pathogenesis, we still do not fully appreciate the impact of environmental stresses on virulence factor production and the influence this may exert on pathogenesis. Following consumption, the

2

acidity of the stomach, is a major barrier encountered by bacteria. The EHEC that survive the exterme low pH then transit on to the intestines, where they must overcome a

different set of biological barriers including bile salts in the small intestine and short chain fatty acids in the large intestine. As a consequence of these extreme environmetal changes, the bacteria must adapt physiologically and morphologically in order to survive. Questions on whether these changes influence major virulence properties, including host cell adhesion and verotoxin production, remain to be answered. To properly address these questions a multidisiplinary approach that includes molecular, cellular and microscopic techniques to identify pathogen-induced changes in infected cells will be needed. The research presented in this thesis will focus on the impact of bile salt and short chain fatty acid stress on the virulence of EHEC. The literature review will provide details of the pathogenic mechanism as well as known and postulated virulence factors, followed by a review of the effect of BS and SCFA stress on virulence of other related gastrointestinal pathogens.

1.2 EHEC Virulence Factors
The ability of E. coli 0157:H7 to cause a spectrum of human illness, including HC and HUS has been attributed to the production of Shiga toxins (Stx) and the presence of a large pathogenicity island (P AI) (Wells et a!., 2008). Genes involved in EHEC pathogenesis are presented in Figure 1.2-1. The pathogenicity island, termed the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE), is a large multi-gene segment which encodes intimin (bacterial adhesin), its receptor Tir (translocated intimin receptor), a type III secretion machine and secreted proteins (EspA, EspB, EspD) necessary for the formation of attaching-and-effacing (AlE) lesions on intestinal epithelial cells (Elhanafi eta!., 2004). The two primary classes of Stx (Stx1 and Stx2) are encoded by two type 'A lysogenic phages inserted in the bacterial genome (Elhanafi et a!., 2004). In addition to Stx, the p0157 plasmid is known to encode the enterohemolysin (ehx) as well as a catalase peroxidase (katP), a zinc metallo protease (StcE), a serine protease (EsP) and a large toxin (ToxB) that contribute to EHEC pathogenesis (Herold eta!., 2004).

1.2.1 Shiga Toxins/Verotoxins
One of the major pathogenicity factors of EHEC is the production of Shiga toxins (Stx), which are responsible for the major symptoms of HC and a sequela called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (Kaper et al., 1998). Stxs act to inhibit the synthesis of host cell proteins and contribute to vascular complications of HC. HUS arises as a consequence of microvascular disease triggered by the toxins entering the bloodstream by clathrin-dependent endocytosis and binding to a cell surface receptor of kidney and brain cells (Hoey eta!., 2003). HUS is characterized by thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia and kidney lesions which can lead to a chronic renal failure and even death (Spear et al., 2006). EHEC strains may produce two major toxins Stx1 and Stx2 which are related to Stx from Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 (O'Loughlin & Robins-Browne, 2001; Garmendia

et al., 2005), however, Stx2 is more frequently associated with HUS. The Stx1 form is
highly conserved and homologous to Stx with only one amino acid difference in the A subunit. The Stx1 and Stx2 A and B subunits are 68 and 73% similar at the amino acid level, respectively, and the crystal structures of Stx and Stx2 are remarkably similar. In contrast, Stx2 has numerous variants including Stx2c, Stx2d, Stx2e, and Stx2f which are distinguished by the receptor to which they bind, thus contributing to the ability of the toxin to target different cells (Fraser et a!., 2004 ). The St:x/Stx 1 and Stx2 differ from one another by the fact they are serologically distinct. The polyclonal antiserum to one toxin group shows no cross neutralization of the cytotoxicity of the other toxin (Strockbine et

al., 1986; Wen et a!., 2006).
Other studies have also shown that more severe infections are often associated with the expression of additional factors encoded on the LEE island and the plasmid p0157 (Nataro & Kaper, 1998). Stx toxins are encoded by stxA and stxB genes which are found on the lysogenic bacteriophages and expressed at neutral pH conditions similar to those of the intestinal tract as VT could be detected in faeces in natural and experimental infections (Karmali et a!., 1983; Ramotar et a!., 1995; Rahn et a!., 1996), cattle (Montenegro eta!., 1990; Ball eta!., 1994; Hyatt et a! ., 2001), pigs (Cornick eta!., 2000), and mice (Isogai eta!., 2000; Zhang eta!., 2000).

5

The expression of the stx genes is thought to be under the control of the E. coli SOS response which is induced by elevated level of intracellular single stranded DNA (Fraser

eta/., 2004).
Stx is an holotoxin (approximately 70 kilodaltons) formed by five identical B subunits that surround a single A subunit. A model of Stx2 is presented in Figure 1.2-2. Once produced in the lower intestine, Stx translocates across the intestinal epithelium, reaches the blood and targets cellular receptors (Paton & Paton, 1998).

Figure 1.2-2 Ribbon crystal structure of E. coli 0157:H7 Stx2.
The A-subunit is red, whereas the B-subunits are orange (chain B), cyan (chain C), green (chain D), yellow (chain E), and blue (chain F). The active site in the A-subunit is marked by the magenta letter A. The side chains of the cysteine residues that link Al and A2 are depicted in yellow. The sites equivalent to the Gb3binding sites on the B-pentamer of Stx 1 are shown by magenta numbers that distinguish the type of binding site. Reproduced from Fraser eta/., 2004.

A simplified model which highlights the mode of action of Stx is presented in Figure 1.2-3. The B subunit (7.7 kDa) is implicated in the binding to the glycolipid globotriaosylceramide-3 (Gb-3) receptor of endothelial cells referred as CD77.

Following internalization, the toxin is transported to the trans Golgi network (Schmitt et

al., 1999). Retrograde transport of toxin from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum
may also be required for the action of toxin to the cells (Sandvig et al., 1992; Sandvig et

al., 1994). The A subunit of the toxins (32 kDa) is implicated in the inhibition of host
protein synthesis and also activation and secretion of chemokines, leading to activation of cells of the immune system (Hoey et al., 2003). As result, the integrity of the epithelial barrier is altered and the translocation of Stx across the mucosa to underlying tissues is facilitated (Gobert et al., 2007). Shiga toxins also induce a cascade of responses including elevated levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of apoptosis caspase cascades that lead to apoptosis in endothelial cells (Hoey et al., 2003). After translocation through the gut mucosa, Stxs first enter the bloodstream to reach the endothelial cells particularly those in the gut, kidney and occasionally other organs (Caprioli et al., 2005). Once the endothelial cells of the target organs are compromised, the toxins act on glomerular and brain microvascular endothelial cells and activate prothrombic and pro-inflammatory cascades, which lead to HUS and complications of the central nervous system (Caprioli et al., 2005). Shiga toxins are cytotoxic to human renal endothelial cells. The characteristic renal histopathology associated with Stx includes swollen glomerular endothelial cells and platelet and fibrin deposition within the glomeruli (Caprioli et al., 2005). It is a decrease in the rate of glomerular filtration that causes the acute renal failure associated with HUS (Paton & Paton, 1998). One report in the literature showed that Stxs contribute to increased adherence to epithelial cells by increased surface expression of nucleolin and
~1

integrin which interact with intimin

(Robinson et al., 2006). Their findings indicate that these eucaryotic proteins are present on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelia and are potentially accessible as receptors for intimin during EHEC 0157:H7 infection (Robinson et al., 2006). These data are consistent with another study by Barnett Foster et al. (2000) which reported that Stx upregulates the level of phosphatidyletanolamine (PE) outer membrane on the host cell which they identified as a candidate host receptor previously reported to bind EHEC. 7

Recently, another study reported that Stx subverts the inflammatory response of human enterocytes by decreasing NF-kB (Gobert eta!., 2007). These results highlight the possibility that Stx is an unrecognized inhibitor of the epithelial cell innate immune response (Gobert eta!., 2007). Together these findings underline an essential role for Stx in the initial step of colonization of the intestinal mucosa. Some studies support the notion that most probably, the production of toxin alone is most likely insufficient to cause disease. Stx (both Stxl and Stx2) when added to colonic epithelial cells, were shown to move across the cell layer without any cytotoxic effects, however when STEC strains were incubated with the cell monolayer, toxin(s) were transported through the cells at the same time and the cell monolayer was destroyed (Law, 2000). These observations suggest that STEC strains may produce other potent toxic products and/or there are possibly other bacterial factors that enhance Shiga toxin activity (Law, 2000).

Holotoxin, which consists of an enzymatically active (A) subunit and five binding (B) subunits, enters cells through the globotriasylceramide (Gb3) receptor. The N-glycosidase activity of the A subunit then cleaves an adenosine residue from 28S ribosomal RNA, which halts protein synthesis. Figure adapted from Schmitt et al., 1999.

1.2.2 Adherence to Host Cells
For successful establishment of infection, E. coli 0157:H7 use some remarkable strategies to adhere to host epithelial cells, survive peristaltic clearance and obtain access to derived nutrients of the distal ileum, cecum and colon. E. coli 0157:H7 adhesion to the epithelial cells is an essential step in the diarrheal infection. EHEC adheres initially non-intimately to the intestinal epithelium surface and then intimately to enhance its attachment (Torres eta/., 2005a). It has been proposed that initial attachment of EHEC to the epithelial cells is mediated by EspA filaments and fimbria! adhesions including long polar fimbria (Lpt) (Kenny, 1999). Following initial adherence, EHEC translocates various Esp effector proteins and Tir into the host via TTSS (Kenny, 1999). The initial adherence of the bacteria to the host cells is followed by the intimate attachment which is associated with the binding of the bacterial non-fimbria! adhesin (intimin) to its own injected receptor Tir (Kenny, 1999). After export to the surface, intimin is then integrated into the bacterial outer membrane with the amino-terminal region and the carboxyterminal region of the polypeptide exposed to the surface (Adams eta/., 2005). From the bacterial surface, intimin projects a cell binding region which is positioned to contact the Tir (Adams et al., 2005). Apart from its interaction with Tir, intimin also recognizes and binds to host cell receptors such as integrin and nucleolin (Donnenberg et a/., 1993; McKee eta/., 1995; Robinson eta/., 2006). By adhering intimately to intestinal epithelial cells, EHEC has the capacity to induce a histopathological feature known as AlE lesions. AlE lesions are distinguished by loss of intestinal microvilli, rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and formation of pedestal like structures that cup the bacterium (Campellone & Leong, 2003; Caprioli eta/., 2005). The proteins required for the formation of AlE lesions are encoded by genes located on the chromosomally-encoded LEE pathogenicity island (Hayashi et a/., 2001; Perna et a/., 2001; Torres et a/., 2005a). The LEE of EHEC consists of genes responsible for the expression of TTSS, intimin, Tir and secreted proteins such as EspA, EspB, EspD, EspG and Map (Torres & Kaper, 2001; Spear et a/., 2006). The TTSS is required for the translocation of various proteins (Esp) including Tir into the host cells. Once Tir has been translocated into the host cell, Tir moves to the plasma membrane where it forms a 9

hairpin loop structure (Garmendia et al. , 2005). While the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains are located within the cell, its central region is located at the surface of the host cell and allows binding of intimin (Garmendia eta/. , 2005). The cytosolic domains of Tir interact with cytoskeleton proteins which lead to formation of actin pedestal structures (Garmendia et al. , 2005). A model for the early and later events associated with EHEC adherence to host cells is presented in Figure 1.2-4.

1.2.3 LEE Pathogenicity Island

Most of the genetic elements responsible for the formation of AlE lesions are encoded within a 43 kb pathogenicity island in the 0157:H7 chromosome, named the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) (Nataro & Kaper, 1998; Caprioli et a!., 2005; Garmendia et a!., 2005). EHEC are a subgroup of the Shiga-toxigenic E. coli (STEC) pathogroup which includes strains that produce Stx but may contain the LEE region or not. LEE negative EHEC strains have been associated with some cases of HUS, indicating that the LEE region is not essential for pathogenicity and that additional factors are involved in causing disease (Paton et a!., 2001 ). The LEE region includes 5 major operons: LEEJ, LEE2, LEE3, tir (LEE5), and LEE4 (Garmendia et a!., 2005). A model of the LEE region that highlights the organization of the genes is presented in Figure 1.2-5. The 41 genes of LEE encode structural components of the TTSS, intimin, Tir, secreted proteins (EspA, B and D) and other TTSS structural proteins, translocators and effectors. The LEE operons are directly activated by the LEE-encoded regulator (Ler), which is the first gene in the LEEJ operon (Kaper eta!., 2004). Regulation of LEE gene expression is complex and is under coordinated activities of three regulatory elements: Ler, GrlR and GrlA (Bustamante et a!., 2001). Ler is a central activator

necessary for the transcription of most of the LEE genes that is further positively and negatively modulated by GrlA and GrlR. The negative effect of GrlR on LEE expression depends on the GrlA function (Goldberg eta!., 2001). Since recent studies have shown that LEE expression is under the control of various regulatory elements outside the locus, its regulatory mechanisms are complicated and require more research for clarification (Grant eta!., 2003; Kaper eta!., 2004).

1.2.4 Type Three Secretion System
In order to sabotage the cellular functions and establish the disease, E. coli 0157 :H7 uses highly sophisticated macromolecular syringes on its surface called type III secretion systems (TTSS). The TTSS apparatus, remarkable similar to a flagellar hook basal body complex, is composed of three distinct parts: a hollow extracellular needle, a cylindrical base body (which crosses two membranes and stabilizes the whole structure upon the cell envelope and bulb) and bulb (like the flagellar cytosolic complex composed of an ATPase and other proteins (Garmendia et a/., 2005). EHEC uses this structure to penetrate and inject its toxins into host cells (Tampakaki et a/., 2004; Pizarro-Cerda & Cossart, 2006). The basal body is composed of the secretin EscC and EscR, EscS, EscT, EscU and EscV which form the inner membrane proteins (Gauthier eta/., 2003). The lipoprotein EscJ bridges the inner and outer membrane ring structures and EscF forms the needle complex of the TTSS (Wilson et a/., 2001). EspA, EspB and EspD together constitute a needle like structure; EspA subunits polymerize to the tip to form the EspA filament and EspB and EspD make up the translocon pore (Delahay et al., 1999). SepD and SepL are cytoplasmic components of this system, and it has been suggested that these proteins may play a role in "switching" the type of proteins secreted through the TTSS, from translocator proteins to effector proteins (O'Connell et a/., 2004). Cytoplasmic

12

ATPases from the bacterial FoF 1 ATPase provides energy to the system and promotes protein secretion (Garmendia eta!., 2005).

1.2.5 TTSS Effectors
Once the molecular syringe has been formed, the effector proteins are translocated into the host cell cytosol where they modulate the host cell signaling through molecular mimicry and hijack the host cell signaling events (Garmendia eta!., 2005). A model of translocation of LEE encoded and other proteins into the host cell cytosol is presented in Figure 1.2-6. In addition, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of critical residues in effectors often triggers the host cell signaling cascade (Garmendia et a/., 2005). These result in cytoskeleton rearrangements (Tir, EspH, EspF and EspG), disruption of the epithelial barrier and tight junctions (EspF and Map), altered ion secretion, cytotoxicity (EspF and Cif), neutrophil recruitment, actin polymerization, disruption of the cell cycle, and transcriptional changes that will ultimately cause watery diarrhea (Dahan eta!., 2004; Garmendia et a!., 2005). Following the delivery of the effector proteins, EspA filaments and the needle-like complex are removed from the bacterial surface to allow intimate attachment of the bacteria and host. Once the bacteria are intimately attached, the LEEencoded genes are down-regulated (Garmendia eta!., 2005).

1.2.6 Non LEE Encoded Effectors
In addition to the above described effector proteins, new effector proteins encoded on prophages or other PAis have been found to be translocated into the host cell. TccP (Tir-cytoskeleton coupling protein), located within the prophage CP-933U, is an effector protein that triggers actin polymerization and is essential for recruitment of a actinin and
AlE lesion formation (Campellone et a!., 2004). Once translocated through the TTSS,

TccP binds indirectly with Tir and then activates the neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N- WASP) and is able to then stimulate Nck-independent actin polymerization leading to pedestal formation (Carlier eta/., 2003).

Figure 1.2-6 Simplified cartoon model for EHEC translocation of LEE encoded and other proteins into the host cell cytosol. EspA filaments of the TTSSs form a needle complex that spans the bacterial inner and outer membrane (IM and OM). Various effector proteins (Esps), including Tir, are translocated into the host cell via the TTSS. Intimate adhesion of the bacteria to the host cell is mediated by the binding of the bacterial adhesin intimin to its receptor Tir. Translocated effector proteins trigger cytoskeleton rearrangements (Tir, EspH, EspF, EspG), disruption of the epithelial barrier (EspF and Map), cytotoxicity (EspF and Cit), and host cell responses that ultimately generate watery diarrhea. EHEC Tir is not tyrosine phosphorylated and does not interact with Nck in order to trigger actin polymerization at the site of bacterial adhesion; instead, EHEC translocates an effector protein, TccP/EspFu, which has an Nck-like activity and is essential to promote the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton underneath adherent EHEC bacteria.

1.2. 7 EHEC Adherence Factors
To date, a number of adhesion factors, both fimbria! and non-fimbria!, have been suggested to play a role in EHEC host cell adhesion (Torres et al., 2005a).

1.2.7.1 Fimbrial Adhesins

Since intimin mutants are still able to colonize host cell epithelial cells, it has been suggested that bacteria produce other yet unidentified adhesins (Torres et al. , 2003). To date, several fimbriae implicated in the binding of EHEC to host intestinal cells have been identified. Torres et al. (2004) have characterized 2 loci-encoding long polar fimbriae which have been proposed to mediate bacterial adherence to tissue culture cells (Torres et al., 2004). EHEC mutants in lpf showed reduced adherence to epithelial cells and formed fewer microcolonies than the wilde type (Torres et al., 2004). The expression of lpfwas observed in response to environmental signals, such as temperature (37°C), pH (pH 6.5), and maximal expression occurred only during the late exponential phase of growth (Torres et al., 2002; Torres et al., 2004). In addition, a cluster of s.fP genes present only on the large plasmid of sorbitol-fermenting EHEC (pSF0157) has been suggested to mediate mannose-resitant hemagglutination and be sufficient in the expression of a novel type of Sfp fimbria (Bronder et al., 2001 ). Other reports have implicated curli (Kim & Kim, 2004), a type I pilus homolog (F9) (Low et al., 2006), and a type IV pilus (TFP) in LEE-negative non-0157: H7 STEC (Srimanote et al., 2002) as mediators of adherence. Recent data demonstrating a role for a fimbria! factor in the adherence of EHEC were published by Xicohtencatl-Cortes et al. (2007). They propose that EHEC produces adhesive type IV pili, termed HCP (hemorrahagic coli pilus), that form bridges between bacteria adhering to human and bovine host cells. Since the expression of these putative adhesins was observed only under specific environmental conditions, additional experiments are required to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of human and bovine organisms (XicohtencatlCortes et al., 2007).

15

1.2. 7.2 Nonfimbrial Adhesins
Intimin is a key adhesion factor demonstrated to play a role in EHEC adherence to intestinal epithelial cells (McKee eta/., 1995; Sinclair & O'Brien, 2002). McKee eta/. (1995) has shown that mutants defective in the E. coli 0157:H7 eae (Escherichia coli attaching and effacing) gene were unable to adhere to epithelial cells, however when intimin was reintroduced, the phenotype was fully restored. They also provided evidence that eae introduced in either pEB31 0 or pEB311 was not sufficient to confer adherence on K-12 strains, resulting in a similar phenotype of impaired microcolony formation in HEp-2 cells. Their data together with those ofDytoc eta/. (1993) and Jerse eta/. (1991) and suggest that additional factors not directly involved in adherence of EHEC may aid in the localization of intimin by the bacteria. In addition to intimin, several nonfimbrial surface proteins have been proposed as novel adhesion factors including Iha (adherence conferring molecule), OmpA (Outer membrane protein A), Saa (autoagglutinating adhesion), ToxB, Efa-1 (EHEC factor for adherence) (Nicholls et a/., 2000; Tarr et a/., 2000; Paton et a/., 2001; Stevens et a/., 2002). As described above, intimin is an outer membrane protein adhesin, which recognizes and binds to its translocated intimin receptor (Tir) to mediate intimate attachment. Intimin, a 94-97 kDa protein, is encoded by the eae gene within the LEE (Elhanafi eta/., 2004). It is exported to the periplasm via the general secretory pathway and inserted into the outer membrane where it can interact with its own injected receptor or bind to host cell integrins and nucleolin (Sinclair & O'Brien, 2002; Garmendia et a/., 2005). Intimin has two functional regions, a highly conserved N-terminal region and a highly variable C-terminal region which defines the types ofintimin (Touze eta/., 2004). Intimin is classified as follows; types a,
~'

y, 8, and c (Sinclair and O'Brien 2004).

Intimin types c and y are present in EHEC strains, whereas type a is mainly associated with EPEC (Caprioli et a/., 2005). Intimin B is found in EPEC and EHEC and is

associated with rabbit Peyers's patch lymphid follicles (Caprioli et a/., 2005). EHEC serotype 0157:H7 produce y intimin (Caprioli eta/., 2005).

16

Intimin is composed of two monomeric subunits, each monomer consisting of a transmembrane region and an extracellular rod formed by three immunoglobulin-like domains (DO to D2) and one lectin-like domain (D3) (Adams et al. , 2005). The Nterminal region of intimin is inserted into the bacterial outer membrane, forms a B-barrellike structure and mediates dimerization, whereas the C-terminal region of intimin extends from the bacterium, and interacts with receptors in the host cell plasma membrane (Adams et al., 2005). Each type of intimin binds to Tir to promote tight adherence of the organism to the host-cell plasma membrane (Sinclair & O'Brien, 2002).

y intimin also binds to nucleolin (host cell receptor) (Sinclair & O'Brien, 2002). This
interaction has been shown to promote initial adherence to the host cells (Campellone & Leong, 2003 ). Once Tir has been translocated into the host cell, it moves to the plasma membrane where it forms a hairpin loop structure. The cytosolic domains of Tir interact with cytoskeleton proteins which lead to formation of actin pedestal structures (Garmendia et al. , 2005). Besides intimin, a number of other adhesins have been suggested to play a role in EHEC host cell adhesion. E. coli factor for adherence (Efa) has recently been proposed to contribute to adherence of0157:H7 to Chinese hamster ovary cells. Mutants defective in this non-fimbria! factor showed a significant decrease in adherence to bovine intestinal epithelium and human tissue cultures relative to the parent strain (Stevens et al. , 2002; Badea et al. , 2003). Since serotype EHEC 0157:H7 strains (EDL933 and 0157Sakai) have a truncated form of efa-1 , it has been proposed that this gene has a role in bacterial adhesion and intestinal colonization (Nicholls et al. , 2000). Interestingly, efa-1 has a significant homology to the toxB gene which has been associated with adherence to epithelial cells (Nicholls et al. , 2000). Stevens et al. (2004) have shown that mutants defective in the E. coli 0157:H7 toxB gene resulted in lower expression and secretion of type III secreted proteins and decreased microcolony formation on epithelial cells. They also provided evidence that a mutation in the truncated efa-1 resulted in a similar phenotype of impaired microcolony formation on HeLa cells. Their data together with those of Tatsuno et al. (200 1) suggest that both genes may function to influence the expression of TTSS at a posttranscriptionallevel (Tatsuno et al., 2001 ).

17

The non-fimbria! Iha (lrgA homologue adhesion) has also been reported to play a role in EHEC host cell adhesion. Iha is a 67 kDa protein found in EHEC strains and is an outer membrane protein which confers adherence to non-adherent laboratory strains (Tarr

eta!., 2000). Tarr et al., (2000) proposed that Iha mediates adherence to He La cells only
when ·it is expressed in non-fimbriated E. coli strain. Probably K-12 strains that lack intimin are able to use Iha for adherence and colonization. Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) has also been shown to act as an E. coli 0157:H7 adhesin, playing a role in bacterial adherence to HeLa and Caco-2 cells (Torres
& Kaper, 2003). Various other adhesins including long polar fimbriae (Torres et a!.,

2004), curli (Uhlich et al., 2001) and F9 fimbriae (Dziva eta!., 2004; Low eta!., 2006) have been implicated as mediators of adherence with no apparent pathogenic role. However, the expression of these described putative adhesins is under tight regulation and thus far intimin is the only factor clearly demonstrated to play a role in EHEC adherence (Torres & Kaper, 2003).

1.2.8 p0157:H7 Plasmid

E. coli 0157:H7 carry a large plasmid (p0157), about 93-104 kB in size, which
has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis ofEHEC (Ostroff eta!., 1990; Paros

eta!., 1993). p0157 is a dynamic structure containing mobile genetic elements such as
transposons, prophages and parts of other plasmids, and as a consequence, the putative virulence factors harboured by this plasmid, appear to be unevenly distributed in EHEC 0157 strains (Caprioli et al., 2005). The plasmid typically carries several virulence genes including hlyA, katP, espP, toxB, tagA, etcC-0, and hlyA-D (Tatsuno eta!., 2001). katP and espP genes encode a katalase-peroxydase and a serine protease, respectively. Their role is still unclear, however studies have shown that antibodies to the espP product are present in sera from children with EHEC infection (Caprioli eta!., 2005). Little is known about EspP, although it has been suggested it may mediate the cleavage and the degradation of the human coagulation factor V, which could result in mucosal hemorrhage, common in HC (Law, 2000). 18 ToxB may confer the ability to allow

adherence to host-cells since strains mutated in toxB, have been demonstrated to reduce adhesion to cultured epithelial cells (Stevens et a!., 2004). Additionally, a type II

secretion system has been associated with this plasmid, yet the secreted targets pertaining to this system have not been identified (Tatsuno et a/., 2001; Caprioli et ·a/., 2005). StcE, a protease, which also is present on the virulence plasmid, has been proposed to contribute to the intimate adherence of E. coli 0157:H7 to host cells (Grys eta/., 2005). The stcE gene, upregulated by Ler, is able to destroy the layer of mucins and glycoproteins, and thereby aids the bacterium to adhere to the host cells by subverting the host mucosal defenses (Grys eta/., 2005).

1.2.9 Regulation of the EHEC Virulence Genes

In order to colonize the host, activate virulence genes, and initiate the disease process, EHEC must sense its surrounding and respond accordingly to any environmental changes (Mekalanos, 1992). Thus, the ability to respond rapidly is essential for the success of the pathogen. Appropriate expression of TTSS genes is achieved through the integration of several signal transduction systems, which allow pathogens to respond to changing microenvironments during infection (Spear et a/., 2006). The complex regulatory cascades reflect their ability to adapt to different niches both inside and outside of the host. LEE-encoded virulence factors are regulated by the LEE-encoded regulator (Ler) which are further positively and negatively modulated by GrlA and GrlR respectively (Deng et a/., 2004). It has also been reported that regulatory mechanisms of activation of LEE1 require perC (plasmid encoded regulator) in EPEC and pch A, Band C (renamed perC homologue pchA, pchB and pchC) in E. coli 0157 :H7 (Spear et a/., 2006). Although LEE 1 expression in EPEC is tied to perC, however this is not the case in EHEC which possesses a number of perC chromosomal homologues that act to increase LEE1 expression (Spear et a/., 2006). LEE genes may be regulated at the post-

transcriptionallevel (Roe eta/., 2003; Stevens eta/., 2004; Deng eta/., 2005). Zang et
a/. (2004) proposed that LEE expression may be repressed by a cryptic second type III

19

secretion island (Zhang et al., 2004). There is likely a cross talk between regulators from other 0-island and TTS-related genes such as flagella (Zhang et al., 2004). Cell to cell signaling between bacteria (quorum sensing) is activated via the LuxS, QseA and SdiA systems (Sperandio et al., 1999; Sperandio et al., 2001; Sperandio et al., 2002); however the mechanism for SdiA binding of signaling HSL to repress EspD and intimin remains to be elucidated. Additionally recent evidence has shown that EHEC may hijack signals produced by other microbial flora and the host that lead EHEC to regulate its virulence genes in a coordinated manner (Clarke & Sperandio, 2005). According to the model proposed by Hughes & Sperandio (2008) EHEC sense autoinducer (AI-3), adrenaline and noradrenaline (NA) signals to activate motility genes (flhDC), Stx genes and LEE genes (components of a type III section system). Overall, TTSS expression in EHEC is under tight regulatory control, however with considerable variation between strains that may contribute to their epidemiology in both humans and cattle (Spear et al., 2006).

1.3 Modulation of Host Cell Function

Multiple functions including disruption of epithelial barrier, altered ion secretion, disruption of tight junctions, neutrophil recruitment, actin polymerization, disruption of cell cycle and transcriptional changes explain the physiological outcome: watery persistent diarrhea (Garmendia et al., 2005).

1.4 Disruption of the Barrier Function

EHEC infection alters the barrier function through disruption of the epithelial barrier and increased monolayer permeability through alteration of tight junctions. EHEC activates several pathways contributing to the disruption of barrier function (Garmendia

et al., 2005). The pathway is the redistribution and activation of ezrin by phosphorylation
on threonine and tyrosine (leads to disruption of tight junctions). A second pathway is the redistribution of tight junction proteins: occludin is dephosphorylated by ser/threonine 20

phosphatases and moves from tight junctions to the cytosol (Berryman et a/., 1993). Another pathway is phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC): MLC associates with

the cytoskeleton and is phosphorylated by MLC kinase- ATP hydrolysis and movement
of filaments past each other to cause an increase in paracellular permeability (ManjarrezHemandez et a/., 1996). A four pathway is the disruption of adherent junctions: phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC) which associates with cadherins dissociation of
cadherin/~catenin

complex which forms adherent junctions.

Several

effectors are involved in induction of these effects including EspF, EspFu/TccP and Map (Malladi eta/., 2004).

1.4.1 Factors Contributing to Diarrhea

In addition to the disruption of the barrier function, several factors contribute to EHEC induced secretory diarrhea. Changes in the host cell electrolyte transport and decrease in membrane potential and increase in short circuit current are observed in EHEC infections. Additionally, changes in chloride secretion and bicarb-dependent chloride transport are observed (Hecht & Koutsouris, 1999). EHEC induces tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-P) of phospholipase C y1 (PLC-y1), cleaves phophatidyl-inositol 4,5-biphosphate (PI45P2) producing 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and (dyacylglycerol) DAG which activates PKC for secretion of ions and fluids (Crane eta/., 1999). Recent research revealed that several ion transport and ion channel proteins are upregulated during TTSSEHEC infection (Hardwidge eta/., 2004).

1.4.2 Host Cell Cytoskeletal Rearrangements
Initial stages of infection are characterized by filapodia of the host tissue at the site of infection that extend and sway for about 20 min and retract into the host cell (Map and Cdc42 dependent) (Kenny et a/., 2002). These are followed by massive rearrangement of the host actin microfilaments triggering AlE lesions and formation of pedestal like structures of host tissue under adherent bacterium - 10 11m outward from host cell. EHEC 21

can move across the surface of infected cells at speeds of up to 0.1 j.tm/sec (Figure 1.4-1) (Sanger et al., 1996). Y474 of EHEC Tir is phosphorylated and the Y474 containing region recruits and activates N-WASP activating Arp2/3 and triggering actin polymerization and pedestal formation (Cantarelli et al., 2002). Watery diarrhea may be generated by disruption of the epithelial barrier, cytoskeleton rearrangements, the inflammatory response to infection, and active chloride secretion resulting from signal transduction, whereas bloody diarrhea may be induced by verotoxin damage to small blood vessels in the large intestine (Law, 2000; Gyles, 2004 personal communication). In addition to causing cytotoxicity, Stx have also been

implicated in inducing programmed cell death or apoptosis (Ceponis et al., 2003). HEp-2 cells exposed to the toxins for 24-48 hours have been shown to show classic morphologic features associated with apoptosis such as cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and nuclear chromatin condensation (Ceponis et al., 2005).

These effectors trigger cytoskeleton rearrangements (Tir, EspH, EspF, and EspG), disruption of the epithelial barrier (EspF and Map), cytotoxicity (EspF and Cit), and host cell responses that ultimately generate watery diarrhea. Different from EPEC Tir, EHEC Tir is not tyrosine phosphorylated and does not interact with Nck in order to trigger actin polymerization at the site of bacterial adhesion; instead, EHEC translocates an effector protein, TccP/EspFu, which has an Nck-like activity and is essential to promote the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton underneath adherent EHEC bacteria.

1.5 Impact of Ingestion Stress on Virulence
During ingestion, enteropathogens are exposed to, and must overcome several hostenvironment stresses. The ability of pathogens to withstand physiological concentrations of bile salt as well as short chain fatty acids is likely to be important for their survival and consequently for their persistence in the GI tract of their host. During infection, bacteria must adapt to changing environments and it is likely that they express specialized colonization factors in a hierarchical manner (Cummings et al., 1987; Begley et al., 2005). Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), which is a related pathogen, has been shown to have enhanced virulence after bile salt and acid stress (de Jesus et al., 2005). EHEC is also well suited to overcoming acid stress in order to infect and cause disease (Elhanafi et

al., 2004). Recent research by House et al., (2006), has demonstrated that acid stress
increases the adhesion to host cells but does not affect verotoxin production, suggesting that exposure to extremely low pH will likely not contribute to increased risk of HUS. Other gastrointestinal pathogens have also been reported to show changes in virulence in the presence of bile. Ramos-Morales and coworkers (2003) have shown that synthesis of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) contributes to Salmonella virulence by protecting the pathogen from BS. Shigella grown in BS have been shown to enhance Ipa protein secretion and increase invasion of epithelial cells (Pope et al., 1995). Vibrio

parahaemolyticus has been shown to have increased expression of TDH virulence factor
(Osawa et al., 2003). Contrary to the positive effect of bile on V parahaemolyticus, Schuhmacher et al. (1999) suggested that Vibrio cholerare in the presence of bile, resulted in decreased virulence gene expression.

1.6 Bacterial Response to Bile Salts
1.6.1 Bile Composition and Function
After overcoming the acid barrier in the stomach, enteric bacteria including EHEC are exposed in the intestinal tract to bile salts. Bile is a detergent-like digestion fluid that disrupts the lipid bilayer structure of cellular membranes, induces protein mis-folding and cause oxidative damage to DNA (Begley eta/., 2005). In humans, the major components 24

of the bile include bile acids, cholesterol, phosholipids (primarily phosphatidylcholine) and the pigment biliverdin (Carey eta!., 1994). Bile acids represent about 50% of the organic components of bile and are conjugated as N-acyl amidates with glycine or taurine before secretion. The carboxyl group of the bile acid and the amino group of the amino acid are linked by an amide bond (peptide linkage) (Hofmann, 1999). Ami dation has significant effects on the bile acid solubility since the unconjugated bile acids are hardly soluble at physiological pH. Conjugation allows bile acids to be soluble over a wide range of ionic strengths, calcium concentrations and pH values (Hofmann, 1999). Taurine and glycine conjugates are called bile salts since they are totally ionized at physiological pH while the unconjugated bile salts are not (Begley et a!., 2005). The major BS present in the intestine are deoxycholate (NaDOC), chenodeoxycholate (NaCDC),

ursodeoxycholate (NaUDC) and glycholate (NaGIC) (Gabig et a!., 2002). The approximate concentrations entering the small intestine are presented in Table 1-1:

1.6.2 Antimicrobial Actions of Bile

The main antimicrobial action of bile has been demonstrated to be through damage to cell membranes by altering membrane integrity/permeability (Pazzi et al., 1997). There are several important factors that determine the exact outcome of bile on cell membranes (Begley et al., 2005). The concentration of bile is a major important factor. High levels of BS have been shown to dissolve membrane lipids and dissociate membrane proteins, causing disruption of membrane integrity (Coleman et al., 1980). BS at low concentrations can also affect the physical chemical properties of cell surfaces. The type and structure of bile also may determine the outcome of bile action on the cell membrane (Begley et al., 2005). For example, bovine bile which passively diffuses much more slowly across the lipid bilayer than porcine bile is also less inhibitory (Legrand-Defretin

et al., 1991 ). Although the composition of porcine bile is more similar to that of human
bile, bovine bile is commonly chosen to assess the in vitro bile tolerance of bacteria (Begley et al., 2005). The membrane architecture and composition are also key factors; charge, hydrophobicity and lipid fluidity have been shown to have significant consequences. Chou and Cheng, (2000) observed that freezing significantly damages the cell membrane lipopolysaccharides making them more susceptible to BS. Besides membrane damage, bile has been shown to induce DNA damage, alter conformation of proteins (misfolding or denaturation) and cause oxidative stress. Research by Bernstein

et al., (1999) has shown that BS induce the expression of several stress response genes: micF, osmY and dinD.

1.6.3 Bile Tolerance

Bile tolerance is poorly understood, particularly in Gram negative bacteria, however it is believed that they are more resistant to bile than Gram positive bacteria (Begley et

al., 2005). Prouty et al. (2004) showed that Salmonella is capable of colonizing the gall
bladder where bile is in extremely high concentrations (Prouty et al., 2004). E. coli is also considered to be very bile resistant since it has been isolated from gallbladder and

26

bile of animals and humans (Brook, 1989; Cable et al., 1997; Carpenter, 1998; Flores et
al., 2003). Another study by Ganzle et al. (1999) reported that E. coli may inhabit the

small intestine of a gastrointestinal model in the presence of high concentrations of porcine bile extract whereas Listeria was rapidly killed. Helicobacter and Campylobacter are also bile resistant and have been isolated from bile ducts, liver and gallbladder (Fox et
al., 1995). In contrast, H pylory has been shown to be sensitive to bile which may

explain why it has never been observed in faecal samples or cholecystectomy specimens (Begley et al., 2005).

1.6.4 Genetics of Bacterial Bile Tolerance
The pathogenic strains of E. coli are able to survive the BS stress by developing adaptive strategies to the stress, including: drug efflux pumps (AcrAB pump), porin proteins (OmpF, OmpC), transport proteins, murein lipoproteins, peptidoglycan associated lipoproteins (Gunn, 2000). Research by Bernstein et al. (1999) has shown that BS induces the expression of several stress response genes: micF, osmY and din. Another study by Wang (2002) suggested that the outer membrane protein OmpA plays a major structural role in E. coli membrane stability. E. coli K1 ompA mutants are significantly more sensitive to environmental stresses (cholate, acidic environment and high osmolarity) resulting in reduced stress resistance. OmpF and OmpC, two major outer membrane proteins, are responsible for the passive diffusion of small molecules in the periplasm. Their expression is conversely regulated; because the OmpF porins form channels larger than those of OmpC. It has been reported that OmpC can exclude larger molecules more efficiently than OmpF porins (Bernstein et al., 1999). In addition, several other factors have been demonstrated to contribute to bacterial resistance to environmental stress. Among these are colanic acid (CA)

exopolysaccharides (EPS) which are cell surface structures and that provide the first line of defence for bacterial cells (Mao et al., 2006). According to these studies, CA EPS of
E. coli 0157:H7 provides a protective barrier to the pathogen while they are exposed to

the various stress conditions in the gastrointestinal tract. The resistance of Vibrio

27

cholerae and other Vibrio species to BS has been attributed to the lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) and outer membrane porins (Provenzano et al., 2000).

1.6.5 Bile Sensing and Regulation of Bile Stress Response
The mechanisms used by bacteria to sense and respond to bile are poorly understood. Bile is thought to be detected by a two-component system (TCSs) (Parkinson and Kofoid, 1992). TCSs are composed of a membrane-associated histidine kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator. The histidine kinase detects the presence of bile, it transduces the signal to the response regulator which instructs the cell to respond to the change via changes in the expression of specific virulence factors (Parkinson and Kofoid, 1992). Bile may also be sensed by responding to the disruption of membrane integrity. Bacterial membrane damage sensors such as E. coli Cpx and ResCh, which sense alterations in the cell surface, may function as sensors and signal transducers (De Wulf et

al., 2002; DiGiuseppe and Silhavy, 2003). In addition, the accumulation of proteins
damaged or denatured by bile may activate a general stress response. Transcription of stress genes with significant roles in bile resistance has been shown to be controlled by two well characterized transcriptional regulators: Sigma B (crB) and RpoS (crs) (Cheville

et al., 1996; Ferreira et al., 2001).

1.6.6 Bile and Pathogenesis

Continuous monitoring of environmental changes is essential for survival for enteric bacteria when making the transition to the human host. It is not surprising that enteric pathogens use bile as an environmental cue to establish the organism's intestinal location and co-ordinately modulate the expression of virulence factors. It is likely that some gene products expressed in bile tolerance assist in survival and colonization of the intestinal tract and thus in their own right, function as virulence factors (Begley et al., 2005). Recent work has uncovered the pathogen responses to bile that alter the

expression of virulence factors in some of the GI pathogens including Salmonella,
28

Shigella, Vibrio, Campylobacter and enteropathogenic E. coli (Pope et al. , 1995; Prouty
& Gunn, 2000; Osawa et al. , 2002; Prouty et al., 2004; de Jesus et al. , 2005; Torres et al. ,

2007). Pathogens respond to bile in different fashions in order to facilitate their own pathogenic mechanisms (Begley et a!. , 2005). Prouty et a!. (2000, 2004) demonstrated that Salmonella sense the bile as environmental signal which consequently downregulates invasion in the intestinal lumen where there are high concentrations of bile. However, upon transit of the mucus layer, where bile concentrations decrease, the expression of the invasion machinery is initiated resulting in an increase in SP-1 genes involved in epithelial cell entry. Pope et al. (1995) provide evidence that Shigella (S.
jlexneri and S. dysenteria) respond to bile in a contradictory fashion; Ipa protein secretion

is up-regulated, and invasion of epithelial cells is increased due to enhanced adherence . A study by Osawa et a!. (2006) on Vibrio parahemolyticus showed that bile acids enhance production of the virulence factor thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH). In addition to these findings, another study by Pace et a!. (1997) also demonstrated that bile acids favor growth of V parahaemolyticus and enhance adherence to epithelial cells. Contrary to the positive effect of bile to V parahaemolyticus, two independent studies demonstrated that growth of V cholerae in bile results in decreased virulence expression (Gupta and Chowdhury, 1997; Schuhmacher and Klose, 1999). Growth in the presence of bile resulted in a decrease in cholera toxin (CT) production and toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP) but an increase in motility. Another study reported that bile inactivates the transcription factor ToxT which induces numerous virulence promotors including those for CT and TCP (Schuhmacher and Klose, 1999). The model proposed by these authors suggests that once bacteria swim into the mucosal gel where bile concentrations are low, motility is decreased, ToxT activity is restored and virulence gene expression required for colonization and disease is induced (Schuhmacher & Klose, 1999). The role of bile in EPEC pathogenesis has also been identified. De Jesus et a!. (2005) identified profound changes in host adhesion of EPEC after exposure to BS stress. BS stress of EPEC significantly increases the adhesion of surviving EPEC to epithelial cells compared to unshocked EPEC. The authors also observed a slight increase in flagella expression and bundle-forming pilus (BFP) after BS (de Jesus et al. , 2005). To 29

our knowledge there are no studies on the impact of BS on changes in E. coli 0157:07 virulence factor expression.

1.7 Short Chain Fatty Acid Stress Response
1.7.1 Short Chain Fatty Acid Composition and Function
Transiting to the large intestine, EHEC must also resist the stress of exposure to short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which are key end products of colonic fermentation (Arnold et al., 2001; Polen et al., 2003). Although the pH of the intesine is almost neutral, there are high concentrations of SCFA present in the large intestine, mainly acetate, propionate and butyrate (Cummings et al., 1987). The organic acids are

preferentially absorbed across the epithelial membranes in the human ileum and colon. Butyrate is of particular importance because it is the major source of energy for colonic epithelial cells (Borthakur et al., 2006). Propionate is largely taken up by the liver whereas acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be metabolized by peripheral tissues (Puchowicz et al., 1999). The concentration of SCFAs is estimated to be low, between 20 and 40 mM total SCFAs in the ileum, and ranges from 100-300 mM in the colon, depending on species and diet (Cummings et al., 1987; Macfarlane et al., 1992). Because the protonated form of SCFA equilibrates across the cytoplasmic membrane, SCFA can lower internal pH even when the external pH is neutral (Roe et al., 1998). The pH of the colon and ileum are similar at around 6. 7 (Lawhon et al., 2002).

30

1.7.2 Short Chain Fatty Acid Tolerance and Pathogenesis

Exposure to SCF As is considered a stress condition and likely impacts the survival of microorganisms, evidenced by the fact that they are widely used as food preservatives to prevent the growth of bacteria (Abdul-Raouf et al., 1993). A study by Lasko eta!. (2000) investigated the response of several probiotics and E. coli K12 after exposure to varying acetate challenges. The authors pointed out that capacity of nonpathogenic E. coli to tolerate acetate was dependent on the carbon source. E. coli exibits higher acetate tolerance in the glycerol grown cultures compared to glucose supplemented media. Moreover, E. coli grown the presence of glycerol is almost tolerant to acetate as are the acetic acid bacteria (AAB) which are best known to be tolerant to acetate (Lasko et a!., 2000). Another study by Polen et a!. (2003) investigated gene expression patterns E. coli 0157 :H7 due to the presence of acetate. The adaptive response of nonpathogenic E. coli exposed to SCFA (acetate and propionate) has been shown to include an increased expression of chemotaxis and flagellum genes, both of which can play a role in colonization of the gastrointestinal tract (Polen et al., 2003 ). Lawhon et a!. (2002) demonstrated that SCFAs alter the expression of Salmonella

typhimurium invasion genes. Acetate activated S. typhimurium invasion whereas
propionate and butyrate (primarly found in the colon) had the opposite effect. The authors suggested that the composition of SCFAs in the small intestine provides a cue to activate

Salmonella invasion while that in the large intestine inhibits invasion (Lawhon et a!.,
2002). Consistent with these findings, Gantois et al. (2006) observed that most genes significantly downregulated after exposure with butyrate are genes of the pathogenicity island 1. Another study by Kirkpatrick et al. (2001) , using a proteomic approach, has revealed that E. coli grown with acetate increased the expression of several amino acid and peptide transporters. The authors suggested that these transporters might enhance the uptake of alternative energy source if the cells perceive acetate uptake as a sign of decreasing availability of carbohydrates. Accentuated expression of components of the RpoS regulon (stress response system) was observed after short term exposure with acetate (Kirkpatrick et a!., 2001 ).

31

1.8 Stress and EHEC Virulence

While significant advances have been made in EHEC pathogenesis, we still do not fully understand the impact of environmental stress on the virulence properties of EHEC including adhesion to host endothelial cells and production of Shiga toxins. Environmental stresses have been clearly demonstrated to enhance the virulence of many enteropathogens. Recent research by de Jesus et a!. (2005) has identified profound changes in host adhesion of a related pathogenic EPEC after exposure to major components of bile. BS stress of EPEC also resulted in a significantly increased adhesion of surviving bacteria to epithelial cells. In addition, our laboratory has also shown that acid shock enhances the adhesion of E. coli 0157 :H7 and its virulence (House et a!., 2006). The role of bile on EHEC adhesion to host endothelial cells and toxin production has yet to be described. The effect of SCFA on E. coli 0157 :H7 virulence is not well understood. Arnold et
a!. (200 1) is one of the first reports that investigated the impact of SCFAs on E. col. This

group only reported gene expression changes of E. coli 0157:H7 which was grown with inhibitory concentrations of 100 mM acetate for 30 min. Their results provided evidence that acetate increases expression of a member of RpoS regulon, as well as various transporters and metabolic enzymes. Another study by Tao eta!. (1999) has shown that

E. coli grown on rich media have elevated expression of the RpoS regulon as well as
OmpC and TpiA, the authors pointing out a role of glucose in generating high acetate levels. A second study by Oh et a!. (2002) investigated the transcript profile of E. coli grown also in acetate as the sole carbon source and compared it with that one of the culture grown in glucose. When grown in the poor carbon source, genes involved in cell replication, transcription and translation were down-regulated whereas metabolic genes were up-regulated. Other studies also revealed increased expression of general stress response genes after short exposure of E. coli to high concentrations of acetate. Louise et
a!. (1995) have established the role of butyrate on Shiga toxin binding, internalization,

intracellular transport and activation in eukaryotic cells. They suggest that butyrate may increase the sensitivity and intracellular traffic in HUVEC as well as Shiga toxin binding to the cell surface (Louise et a!., 1995). Interestingly, recent research by Borthakur et a!. 32

(2006) showed that enteropathogenic E. coli which is a related EHEC pathogen, modulates the butyrate uptake in Caco2 cells. EPEC infection inhibits butyrate uptake in Caco2 cells whereas infection with nonpathogenic E. coli had no effect. Other complementary studies have also demonstrated that butyrate is implicated in suppressing mucosal inflammation (Inan et a/. , 2000; Segain et a/. , 2000). Taken together, these results suggest that decreased butyrate uptake caused by EPEC infection may compromise the colonic epithelial integrity, resulting in inflammation of the epithelium (Borthakur eta/. , 2006). Recent studies by Carey et a/. (2008) used several probiotic strains to evaluate the effect of SCFAs on Stx2 gene expression in E. coli 0157:H7. All strains tested down regulated stx2A expression to different degrees, the authors suggesting that may be attributed to the type and amount of organic acid produced by each probiotic strain. Takahashi et a/. (2004) also suggested that due to butyric acid production, Clostridium
butyricum might be able to inhibit EHEC growth. However further research is needed to

fully understand the impact of SCFA stress on EHEC toxin production since these published reports have only examined the impact of pro biotic strains. The role of major SCFA including acetate, propionate and butyrate as well as that the mixture mimicking the large intestine, on E. coli 0157:07 needs to be explored.

1.9 Purpose of Investigation and Hypothesis
1.9.1 Research Rationale
It is becoming increasingly clear that pathogens respond to BS and SCFA in a

variety of fashions to facilitate their specific pathogenic mechanisms. Bile represses
Salmonella invasion but stimulates invasion of Shigella (Begley eta/., 2005). It is evident

that that BS and SCFA can trigger changes in virulence properties of gastrointestinal pathogens. However, there is little known about how these stresses modulate the virulence potential of E. coli 0157:H7. Further research is required to fully delineate the effect of BS and SCFA stress on EHEC virulence gene expression. This study will contribute to the developing picture of a complex relationship between E. coli 0157:H7
33

and its environment within the host during infection. Moreover, it will be essential for describing novel approaches to prevent and heal EHEC infections.

1.9.2 Hypothesis

Exposure to physiological concentrations of BS and SCFA will significantly increase EHEC virulence including host cell adhesion and toxin production

1.9.3 The Main Objectives of this Thesis
1) Assess impact of exposure of E. coli H157:07 to physiological relevant concentrations of BS on virulence including survival, host adhesion and toxin production

(

2) Assess impact of exposure of E. coli H157:07 to physiologically relevant concentrations of SCFA on virulence, including host adhesion and toxin production

3) Clarify the role of known adhesins in the adhesion of BS and SCFA treated E coli 0157:H7.

2.2 Epithelial Cell Culture
Human epithelial cell lines, HEp-2 (laryngeal carcinoma cells), and CaCo-2 (colonic adenocarcinoma cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were used in various adhesion assays. Vero cells (African Green Monkey Kidney cells) were kindly provided by Dr. Lingwood (Hospital of Sick Children, Toronto) and were used in Vero Cell Cytotoxicity Assays (see Table 2.2 below). All tissue cell culture conditions consisted of growing the cell lines in minimal essential media 1x Eagle's (modified) (Wisent; with Earle's salts and L-glutamine) supplemented with gentamycin (20, 000 ug/mL) and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Wisent) for HEp-2 and Vero cell lines and 20% (v/v) for CaCo-2 cells (MEM . with additives). All cell lines were grown to confluence at 37

oc and 5% C02 (v/v) in

cell culture vented flasks. Vero and HEp-2 cells were maintained by subculturing the cells into fresh pre-warmed media every 3-4 days. Maintenance of the CaCo-2 cell line required fresh media after the 4th day of incubation and on the 6-7th day when the cells were transfered to fresh prewarmed media. One day prior to adhesion assay, cells were seeded into 24 well or 6 well plates and grown to 80-90% confluence.

2.3 Bile Salt Treatment of E. coli 0157:H7
One day prior to the experimental day, bacteria (Table 2.1) were grown in LB broth supplemented with appropriate antibiotics when necessary. A 1:8 dilution of overnight culture was made into prewarmed Dulbecco's MEM (DMEM) pH 7.4 (Wisent; 4.5g/L 36

glucose, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate) and grown statically for 2-2.5 hours at 37°C, 5% C02 to mid-log growth phase. Expression of LEE-encoded virulence factors is known to be influenced by bacterial growth phase or enviromental factors such as culture medium, temperature and pH (Rosenshine et al., 1996; Abe et al., 2002; Lio and Syu, 2004). Bacteria were grown in prewarmed DMEM pH 7.4 as it has been reported that the secretion of LEE-encoded virulence factors are enhanced when EHEC strains are grown in DMEM and result in maximal adhesion to CaCo-2 cells (Abe et al., 2002; Lio and Syu, 2004). It also has been reported that environmental factors similar to those in the intestine such as 5% C02 enhance secretion of pathogenic proteins and VT1 production in EHEC (Yoh et al., 2003). Cells were grown to an OD6oo of0.4-0.6 (logarithmic phase) as it has been shown that early-logarithmic-phase of EPEC enhances LEE -protein secretion and increases AlE activity to He La epithelial cells (Rosenshine et al., 1996; Kenny et al., 1997; Vanmaele and Armstrong, 1997). 4 mL of the induced bacteria culture was aliquoted to 15 mL Falcon tubes (one for each treatment type) and centrifuged at 3,500 rpm (2,000 x g) for 10 minutes at 18°C. The resulting supernatant was removed and BS were added to the DMEM pH 7.4 at the final concentration of 2.5 mM glycocholate (Sigma), 2.5 mM chenocholate (Sigma), 2.5 mM deoxycholate (Sigma), 2.5mM ursocholate (Sigma) and 0.15% BS mix (Sigma) (Pope et al., 1995; Gunn, 2000). The control treatment (untreated) was resuspended in sterile filtered DMEM pH 7.4. Bacteria were incubated statically at 37°C, 5% C02 for 90 minutes and then cetrifugated at 3500 rpm (2,000 x g) for 10 minutes. Supernatants were removed from all tubes and bacterial pellets were washed with 2 washes of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Wisent without calcium and magnesium) to ensure that all traces of BS were removed. After the second wash, the supernatant was removed and all treatments were resuspended in 4 ml of sterile filtered DMEM pH 7.4. An OD600 reading was taken again to ensure that the culture was in the logarithmic phase of growth (0.4-0.6). Table 2.3 summarizes the various experimental BS treatments used in this study.

2.4 Short Chain Fatty Acid Stress of E. coli 0157:H7
Prior to addition of the short chain fatty acids (SCFA), strains were grown in 10 ml LB with appropriate antibiotics when necessary, in a shaking incubator at 37°C, 200 rpm for approximately 4-5 h. 2 ml aliquots of culture were transferred to 14 Falcon tubes (one for each treatment), and centrifuged at 3500 rpm (2,000 x g) for 10 minutes at 18°C. The bacterial pellet from each tube was resuspended in LB broth containing SCFAs at following final concentrations: 110 mM sodium acetate (EMD), 70 mM sodium propionate (Alfa Aesar), 20 mM sodium butyrate (Alfa Aesar) and --- 90 mM SCFAs mixture. SCFAs mixture is composed of 60.5 mM acetate (69%), 24.5 mM propionate (28%) and 3 mM butyrate (3%) (Lawhon eta/. , 2002). Following overnight growth, LB broth cultures were diluted 1:8 in DMEM pH 7.4 with appropriate SCFAs (as the same concentrations as above) and grown to mid-log growth phase. The control treatment (unshocked) was resuspended in sterile filtered DMEM pH 7.4. All bacteria were incubated statically at 37°C, 5% C02 for 2-2.5 hours at, 5% C02 and then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes. The resulting pellets were washed two times with PBS to remove any traces of SCFAs. After the second wash, the supernatant was removed and all treatments were resuspended in DMEM pH 7.4. OD 600 readings were taken again to ensure that the cultures were in the logarithmic phase of growth (0.4-0.6) and samples were ready for use in viability, adhesion and cytotoxicity experiments.

2.5 Percent Survival of Treated E. coli 0157:H7
Bacteria exposed to either BS or SCFA were obtained using the appropriate Stress Treatments, as described above. A dilution series for each experimental treatment was made in PBS and the bacteria were plated out on LB agar plates, with or without appropriate antibiotic. All plates were incubated at 37°C for 16-18 hours. Colony counts for plates that contained 30-300 colony forming units (CFU) were completed and used in subsequent calculations to determine the percentage of surviving organisms after BS and SCFA exposure (as assessed by culturability).

2.6 Bacteria- Host Cell Adhesion Assay: Colony Plate Count Method

Adhesion of BS and SCFA treated EHEC strains to either HEp-2 or CaCo-2 cells was assessed by a colony plate count assay as described previously by De Jesus et al. (2005). This method allows quantification of live organisms after stress.

Using a

haemocytometer (Hausser Scientific), epithelial cells grown in a 25 cm vented flask (BD Falcon) were enumerated and seeded in a 24-well flat bottom plates (BD Falcon) to 39

approximately 80-90o/o confluence on the day of the experiment (~ 2 x 10 5 (24-well). MEM with additives was added to each well to bring it to 0.5 mL (24-well) and plates were then incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% C02. Bacterial cultures of strains grown on LB with the appropriate antibiotics were either BS or SCFA treated using the previously described methods. Using a haemocytometer, epithelial cell counts (cells/mL) from

several wells were determined and averaged. This cells/mL value was used in conjunction with the bacterial OD6oo value to determine the approximate amount of bacterial solution to be added to each well to achieve a multiplicity of infection (MOl) of 100:1. Results indicated that actual MOis varied from 22- 444. According to preliminary results obtained in the lab the MOl value is critical since there is a correlation between the number of bacteria loaded and adherence to epithelial cells. Results show that the more bacteria are loaded, the less they adhere to epithelial cells. To confirm the MOl, serial dilutions of all bacterial treatments were made in PBS (Wisent without calcium and magnesium) and plated out on LB agar. Only plates with 30-300 colonies were used in subsequent calculations. Prior to cell infection, the media from each well (24-well plates) was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4. 105 cells were infected with 107 bacteria so the MOl of 100:1 was achieved and fresh DMEM without antibiotics was added to each well to bring the volume up to either 0.5 mL (24 well plate) or 3 mL (6 well plate). The infected mono layers were incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 4 hours of infection. After a total of 4 h incubation, the media and non-adherent bacteria were removed, and the wells washed five times with PBS pH 7.4. Adherent bacteria and remaining epithelial cells were detached by adding 250 uL trypsin-EDTA (0.25% trypsin; 1 mM EDTA·4Na). After approximately two minutes incubation at 37°C, 5% C02, 50 uL of FBS was used to stop the trypsin reaction, and the cells from each well were added to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. The wells were rinsed with 200 uL of cold sterile distilled deionized H20 (ddH20) and this was added to the tubes. Complete detachment of cells from wells was verified microscopically. Epithelial cells were lysed with 500 ul cold sterile ddH20 and then were added to each tube (total 1 mL per well, for 24 well plates). The number of viable bacteria bound to adherent cells, were quantified by serial dilution in PBS performed for each treatment (with triplicates). The appropriate dilutions (10- 5, 10-6, 10-7) were plated on LB agar containing antibiotics when necessary, and incubated 40

between 16-18 hours at 37°C. The following day, the colonies were counted and plates that had between 30-300 colonies were used for further calculations and statistical analysis.

2.7 Impact of Erythromycin-Mediated Inhibition of Protein Synthesis on Bacteria-Host Adhesion
A modified version of a previously described method by de Jesus et al. (2005) was used to assess the involvement of newly synthesized adhesins after stress. E. coli 86-24 cultures were grown on LB followed by either BS or SCFA treatment. Following the stress treatment, 4 mL of neutralized bacterial suspension, in DMEM pH 7.4 for each treatment, was divided into two tubes of 2 mL aliquots; 2 mL of each treatment will be subjected to erythromycin treatment and the other without. All tubes were centrifuged at 3,300 rpm (2,000 x g) for 10 minutes at 18°C and resuspended in 2 mL DMEM pH 7.4 with or without 0.06 mg/mL erythromycin (Sigma), depending on the treatment. All tubes were left at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to cell infection. The effect of erythromycin on BS stressed bacterial adhesion to HEp-2 cells was determined by a 24 well colony plate count assay as previously described in Section 2.6.

2.8 Bile Salt/Short Chain Fatty Acids Treated E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 Growth during Infection Time
This experiment was performed to assess the impact of BS and SCFA exposure on the growth of E. coli 86-24 throughout the infection time in a four hour bacterial-host cell adhesion assay. Cultures of E. coli 86-24 were grown in LB, then either BS or SCFA stressed using the previously described BS or SCFA treatment in Section 2.3, Section 2.4. After stress, the treatments were normalized using prior viability data to ensure that the initial inoculum was approximately the same. To validate the normalization, a dilution series was prepared in PBS for each normalized treatment and plated on LB agar and incubated at 37°C for 16-18 hours. 100 uL of normalized bacteria from each treatment was added to an empty (cell-free) well from a 24-well plate and MEM (without additives) was added to each well to bring the volume to 0.5 mL, and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 . 41

After 4 h incubation time, the media and bacteria were removed and added to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. To determine the impact of BS and SCFA stress on bacterial growth, serial dilutions using PBS were performed for each treatment. The appropriate dilutions (10" 5, 10"6 , 10-7) were plated on LB agar (triplicates) and incubated between 1618 hours at 37°C. Following incubation, colonies were counted and plates that had between 30-300 colonies were used in subsequent calculations and statistical analysis.

2.9 Qualitative Microscopic HEp-2 cell Adhesion Assay after Exposure to Bile Salts/Short Chain Fatty Acids
One day prior to experiment, epithelial cells grown in a 25 cm2 vented culture flask (BD Falcon) were enumerated with the aid of a haemocytometer (Hausser Scientific) and then added to 6-well flat bottom plates with coverslips (BD Falcon) so that the cell monolayer would be approximately 80-90% confluent on the experimental day; 8 x 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate. DMEM with additives was then added to each well to bring the volume to 3 mL. The plates were then incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% C02. LB culture of E. coli 86-24 was subjected to either BS or SCFA stress using previously described BS or SCFA Treatment (Section 2.3 and 2.4). Epithelial cell counts (cells/mL) from 2-3 wells and the approximate amount of bacterial solution to be added to each well were determined as previously described in Bacteria- Host Cell Adhesion Assay: Colony Plate Count Method (Section 2.6). DMEM (without additives) was added to each well to bring the volume up to 3 mL and the well plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for four hours. After 4-hour infection time, media and non adherent cells were removed and wells with coverslips were washed five times with PBS. The cells were fixed by adding 2 ml of 100% methanol (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. After incubation, the cells were stained by adding 2 ml of Giemsa stain (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes. Cells were washed few times with dH20. For microscopic preparation, the coverslip from each well was carefully removed with forceps and rinsed with acetic acid solution (1 %), placed on a glass slide (25 mm x 75 mm, VWR). Coverslips were then sealed on the glass and were ready for examination

42

under the light microscope. A Leica DM 5000B Microscope equipped with camera was used. Images were taken at 630x magnification using immersion oil.

2.10 Vero Cell Cytotoxicity Assays
Shiga toxin produced during stress of E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 was assessed by exposing Vero cells in microtiter cultures to dilutions of toxin. A modified version of The Quantitative Micro titer cytotoxicity assay as previously descried by Karmali et a/., (1985) and Khine et a/., (2004) was used to assess Shiga toxin produced during stress. Briefly, one day before the experiment, Vero cells grown to confluency (80-90%, 75 cm2 flasks) were trypsinized with 2 mL oftrypsin-EDTA and incubated for approximately 2 minutes at 37°C, 5% C02 . Following trypsinization, cells were counted and suspended to the desired concentration in growth medium. Seven 96-well microtiter plates (BD Falcon), one for each experimental treatment type (BS or SCFA) and one for the control were seeded with 200 uL of the vero cell solution using a multichannel pipettor. Mono layers were established by incubating the plates overnight at 37°C, 5% C02 . Negative controls were wells containing cells not exposed to toxin that were included on each plate. LB culture of 86-24 was subjected to either BS or SCFA stress as previously described in Section 2.3 and 2.4. After stress, the treatments were normalized using prior viability data to ensure that the initial innoculum was approximately the same. To validate the normalization, a dilution series was prepared in PBS for each normalized treatment and plated on LB agar and incubated at 37°C for 16-18 hours. For verotoxin production, 1 mL of each bacterial treatment was added to 14 mL of Penassay broth (antibiotic medium no. 3; Difco Laboratories) and incubated overnight at 37°C and 200 rpm. Following overnight incubation, 2 mL of each treatment were used to obtain OD6oo readings and/or serial dilutions were performed in PBS. The appropriate serial dilution were plated on LB agar and incubated at 37°C for 16-18 hours. After all treatments, cells were centrifuged at 3,500 rpm (2,000 x g) for 10 minutes at 18°C, 10 mL of the supernatant was filter sterilized using 0.2 urn membrane filters and 10 cc Leur-Lok syringes (BD Falcon). The supernatant filtrates were stored at -20°C for no longer than a week until use. The remaining supernatant was aspirated and bacterial pellet was 43

resuspended in 1.5 mL of 0.1 mg/mL colymycin (Parker Davis) and incubated statically at 37°C for 30 minutes. The treatments were then centrifuged at 3300 rpm for 10 minutes at 18°C and the periplasmic extracts were filter sterilized using 0.2 urn membrane filters and 3 cc leur-lok syringes (BD Falcon). The resulting periplasmic extracts were stored at -20°C for no longer than a week until use. On the day of the experiment, frozen experimental extracts and filtrates were thawed and dilutions of the samples 111, 115, 1125, 11125, 1/625 and 1115625 were made in MEM (no additives) and 50 uL of each dilution for each experimental treatment (both periplasmic extracts and supernatant filtrates) was added, with replicates, to the wells. For the control wells, 50 uL of MEM (no additives) were added. All plates were incubated for 2-3 days at 37°C, 5% C02 · After incubation, the detached cells, medium and toxin in the wells were removed by vigorous shaking. Remaining live cells in each well were fixed with 65 uL of a 2% solution of formalin (0.05% of a 40% formaldehyde (v/v), 95% PBS (v/v)). The plates were incubated at room temperature for approximately 1-2 minutes and fixative was removed from the wells. The wells of the plates were stained with 65 uL of Crystal Violet Tissue Culture stain (0.26% of 0.5% Crystal Violet Stock Solution (v/v), 0.05% absolute ethanol (v/v), 0.05% of 40o/o formaldehyde (v/v), 0.64o/o of PBS (v/v)) and incubated at room temperature for a minimum of 20 minutes. The excess crystal violet stain was removed and the wells were rinsed four times with ddH2 0 and the plates were left to air dry. To quantify the results, 100 uL of 10% acetic acid solution (Fisher Scientific) was added to solubilize the Crystal Violet and the absorbance was determined at 570 nm in an ELISA plate reader.

2.11 Statistical Analysis
The mean and standard deviations of all quantitative adhesion and cytotoxicity assay results were calculated. A two-tailed Student t-test was used to determine if the results for E. coli 0157 :H7 after exposure to BS or SCFA were significantly different from the control unstressed cells. P-values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

3 Results
3.1 Bile Salt Treatment Enhances E. coli 0157:H7 Survival
The viability of E. coli 0157:H7 was predicted to be affected after BS exposure. To determine whether E. coli 0157:H7 strains were capable of survival after BS treatment, the viability of wild-type strain 86-24 was assessed before and after BS as described in the Methods Section 2.6 using a plate count method. The viability of BS stressed EHEC 86-24 wt was increased 1.2- 1.5 fold relative to that ofunshocked (Fig 3.1). BS treatment resulted in significantly increased viability of log phase E. coli 0157 :H7 strains relative to that of untreated. Similar trends were obtained with other E. coli 0157:H7 strains such as 8624
eae~10

and 8624

eae~(pEB3lO)

which showed significantly increased survival

levels compared to untreated bacteria (data not shown).

3.2 Bile Salt Treatment Enhances ·E. coli 0157:H7 Adhesion to Human Epithelial Cells
To judge the level of adherence of E. coli 0157:H7 strains to human epithelial cells, adhesion assays before and after BS stress were conducted. Bacterial adhesion was determined by plate count assay (Fig 3.2-1) and light microscopy was used as as a complimentary method (Figure 3.2-2). Adhesion of BS mixture and glycholate treated EHEC 86-24 to epithelial cells was significantly higher than that of the untreated control EHEC 86-24. Adhesion enhancement factors ranged from 1.5 - 2.1 for HEp-2 cells to 4.8 for Caco-2 cells (Fig 3.2-1, Figure 3.3-1 and Table 1 Supplementary Data).

In agreement with the previous results obtained, light microscopy Images of infected Giemsa stained cells showed obvious increased adherence of BS mixture and glycocholate treated E. coli 0157:H7 as compared with untreated strains (Figure 3.2.2). HEp-2 cell monolayers were incubated with BS treated EHEC 86-24 for 4 hours as described in Materials & Methods (Section 2.6). Adhesion patterns were typical of those reported for EHEC adherence to cultured epithelial cells (Torres and Kaper, 2003).

3.3 Erythromycin Treatment Abrogates EHEC 0157:H7 Adhesion Enhancement
To investigate further whether the adhesion enhancement is a result of increased expression of adhesins, erythromycin, below the MIC, was used to inhibit protein synthesis (de Jesus et al., 2005). Pretreatment of BS treated bacteria with erythromycin eliminated the adhesion enhancement seen after exposure to BS (Figure 3.3-1 ), suggesting that enhanced adhesion could result from either upregulated adhesion expression and or modifications to existing adhesins. Interestingly, with Caco2 cells, the BS mixture treatment ofEHEC 86-24 caused an increase which is about 4.8 fold increase rather than just 2.1 fold increase for HEp-2 cells (Figure 3.3-1 and Figure 3.2-1). However, we do not see a significant increase in adhesion after exposure to glycholate treatment.

3.4 No Role of Intimin in Enhanced Adhesion of Bile Salt Treated EHEC 0157:H7
To explore the contribution of intimin, a known adhesin in increased adhesion after BS stress, intimin mutants
(86-24eae~l0

and

86-24eae~(pEB3lO))

were used to To

investigate adherence to human intestinal cells with and without BS exposure.

achieve this aim, first we ran a control experiment to compare adhesion capability of E.
coli 0157:H7 wild-type 86-24 and intimin mutants obtained with the tissue culture

49

adherence assays. It was verified that intimin negative mutant adhered significantly less than parental strain (8 fold decrease) and intimin recomplemented mutant strain adhered only marginally less than parental strain (1.4 fold decrease). This result confirms the importance of intimin in adhesion to cells in culture (data not shown). Although the eae mutant is much less adherent than wild-type, adhesion after exposure to BS was similarly increased, indicating that intimin is likely not involved in the adhesion enhancement (Figure 3.4-1). Interestingly, although both untreated and BS treated
86-24eae~10

were only weakly adherent (about 10 times less than untreated wt
86-24eae~10

86-24) there was a significantly increase in adhesion ofBS mixture treated relative to that of untreated
86-24eae~10

(2.3 fold adhesion increase ), which suggests

that the BS mixture may be triggering expression of adhesins (Figure 3.4-1 ). Complementation of the eae gene in pEB31 0 in 86-24 (resulted in
86-24eae~(pEB31 0))

showed restoration of adherence to a level slightly higher than that seen in the parental strain (1.5 fold adhesion increase after BS mixture treatment) (Figure 3.4-2). Taken together, the adherence data suggest that intimin is not the adhesin responsible for the increase in adhesion observed after BS treatment.Other colonization factors may contribute to increased adhesion to human intestinal cells.

3.5 No Role of Iha in Enhanced Adhesion of Bile Salt Treated EHEC 0157:H7
To investigate whether Iha (bacterial adherence-conferring protein) is a prerequisite for increased adhesion in BS treated EHEC, iha mutants and nonpathogenic
E. coli complemented with iha were used in quantitative adherence assays. Firstly, 8624!1iha mutant adhered at about 70% of the wt strain 86-24 level (1.69% and 2.5%

52

respectively) (Figure 3.5-1).

These results are consistent with previous reports that

indicate that iha plays a role in adhesion of EHEC to host cells (Tarr et a!. , 2000). To confirm the involvement of iha, adhesion of wt 86-24 and
86-24~iha

were compared

before and after exposure to BS. Similar adhesion enhancements were noted for strains
86-24~iha

(1.7 fold adhesion increase) and wt 86-24 (2.1 fold adhesion increase) relative
86-24~iha

to their untreated

and wt 86-24 control strains (Figure 3.5-1 and Table 1

Suplementary Data). Although the iha mutant is significantly less adherent (2.88%) than
wt 86-24 (5.29%), there was a similarly increased adhesion after exposure to BS mixture

relative to that of untreated controls (Figure 3.5-1). These results suggest that E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 does not utilize iha for the increased adherence observed after BS exposure, and other factors must be involved.

Since Iha has been described to contribute to enhanced adherence of non-adherent laboratory E. coli strains, we tested BS treated ORN172(piHA) and ORN172(pSK+) to determine if Iha is responsible for the enhanced adhesion after BS exposure. E. coli ORN172(piHA) is a nonvirulent laboratory strain which expresses the iha in trans, while 0 RN 172(pSK+) carries the plasmid alone and and does not carry iha in its chromosome (Tarr et a!., 2000). Untreated E. coli ORN 172(plha) adhered 4x more than ORN172 (pSK+) demonstrating that Iha plays a major role in adhesion when transgenically

expressed in a non-pathogenic E. coli background (Figure 3.5-2). There is no significant increase in adhesion of mixture treated ORN 172(piHA) relative to the untreated, confirming that Iha does not likely play a role in BS induced adhesion of E. coli 0157:H7 (Figure 3.5-2). There is also no significant increase in the mixture treated in ORN172 (pSK+) relative to the untreated, suggesting that there is no upregulation of adhesins in the nonpathogenic ORN 172 after BS treatment (Figure 3.5-2). Taken together both sets of results point toward no role for iha suggesting that other adhesins or virulence factors which are not present in laboratory strains are necessary for increased adhesion after BS treatment.

3.6 Short Chain Fatty Acids Decrease E. coli 0157:H7 Viability
Several species of Gram-negative bacteria are known for their considerable tolerance to SCFA (Lasko eta!. , 2000; Arnold eta!., 2001; Lawhon eta!., 2002; Polen et

a!., 2003; Maurer et al., 2005). Less toxic effect on some microorganisms has been
attributed to the weak acid nature of most of the organic acids. However, SCFA are capable of exhibiting bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties. Most of these compounds can easily penetrate the lipid membrane of the bacterial cell where they dissociate into anions and protons and may stress bacteria by depleting cellular energy (Ricke, 2002). Our hypothesis was that survival of EHEC will be reduced after SCFA stress. To test this hypothesis, we employed a plate count method to assess whether E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 was capable of survival after SCFA exposure. As predicted, in the presence of either individual treatments or a mixture of all SCFAs, E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 resulted in significantly lower viabilities relative to that of the control by a factor of 1.3 - 1.5. 55

Butyrate and propionate treatments showed even significantly lower survival levels over the other two treatments; acetate and mixture. These observations may suggest a higher impact of butyrate and propionate treatments on the survival of the bacteria. The results ofSCFA stress on the viability of E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 are shown in Figure 3.6-1.

3.7 Short Chain Fatty Acids Stress Enhances E. coli 0157:H7 Adhesion to Human Epithelial Cells
In order to establish infection, E. coli 0157:H7 must overcome the short chain fatty acid stress environment of the large intestine. Since there are no previous studies that have addressed the role of SCFA on EHEC adherence capability, the present study tried to clarify whether SCFA stress has any impact on EHEC adhesion to epithelial cells. 56

To judge the level of adherence of E. coli 0157:H7 strains to human epithelial cells, adhesion assays before and after SCF A stress were conducted. Quantification of bacterial adherence to human intestinal cells was determined by plate count assay as previously described by de Jesus et a/. (2005). The effect of different SCFAs was examined, individually and in combination (acetate, propionate, butyrate and a mixture of above). EHEC 86-24 (0157:H7) strains were assesed with either human colonic Caco-2 or nonintestinal HEp-2 epithelial cells for 4 hours. No significantly different bacterial adherence on epithelial cells was produced with either acetate or propionate treatments relative to unshocked control. However, adhesion of butyrate and SCFA mixture treated EHEC 86-24 to epithelial cells (either HEp-2 or Caco-2 cells) was significantly higher than that of untreated control EHEC 86-24. Adhesion enhancement factors ranged from 1.5- 1.8 for butyrate and 1.63 for SCFA mixture (Fig 3.7-1; Figure 3.8-1 and Table 2 Supplementary Data). It is possible that changes in bacterial adherence to eukaryotic cells after treatment could depend on the concentration of SCFA used. Future research should examine the role of concentration of SCFA in the adhesion of treated bacteria.

3.8 Erythromycin Treatment Abrogates Short Chain Fatty Acids Host Adhesion Enhancement
To determine whether the adhesion enhancement observed after SCFA stress was a result of increased expression of adhesins, erythromycin, below the MIC, was used to inhibit protein synthesis (de Jesus et a!., 2005). Following stress, all treatments were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with or without 0.06 mg/mL erythromycin. The adhesion capability of E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 after SCFA stress exposure to HEp2 cells was examined in the presence of erythromycin. Pretreatment of bacteria with

erythromycin significantly decreased the adhesive capability of E. coli 0157:H7 to Caco2 cells (Figure 3.8-1).

3.9 The Effect of Bile Salts and Short Chain Fatty Acids Stress on E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 Growth during Infection Time
The enhanced adhesion ofBS and SCFA stressed E. coli 0157:H7 to tissue culture cells may be due to increased growth that may arise after BS or SCFA stress. To test this possibility, control adhesion assays were employed; E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 was exposed to either BS or SCF A and then incubated, but without epithelial cells, simulating the conditions of the adhesion assays previously described. After 4 h incubation at 37°C with 5% C02 bacteria were plated out and the next day counted (Figure 3.9-1 and Figure 3.92). Three of the treatments (glycholate, deoxycholate and ursocholate) showed significantly higher final viability compared to the control. These results may point out the possibility that the enhanced adhesion ofBS stressed E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 might be due to increased growth after stress. 59

The growth of SCFA stressed E. coli 0157 :H7 86-24 during 4 hr incubation time showed a significant decrease in viability for all treatments in comparison to the control. These results are consistent with previous viability results of EHEC 86-24 after exposure to SCFAs and indicate that increased adhesion of SCFA stressed E. coli 015 7 :H7 86-24 is not mediated through increased growth during infection time.

3.10 No Change in Secreted and Periplasmic VT Production after BS Treatment
The effect of BS stress on both the verotoxin secreted, as well as that retained in the periplasmic space of 86-24 was examined using the vero cell cytotoxicity assay. The bacteria were subjected to either BS or SCFA stress, then normalized based on prior viability experiments and grown overnight in rich media to induce verotoxin production. Various dilutions of the supernatant filtrates and periplasmic extracts were incubated with semi-confluent monolayers of vero cells for 2-3 days at 37°C with 5% C02 . The remaining live cells were fixed with 2% formalin and stained with crystal violet. The 61

crystal violet staining of verocells is an indirect measure of levels of toxin produced. Levels of secreted verotoxin (in the supernatant) and verotoxin retained in the periplasmic space formed with BS-stressed 86-24 were determined by measuring the absorbance of crystal violet with an ELISA plate reader (Figures 3.10-1 and 3.10-2). None of the BS stress treatments appeared to show any significant change in verotoxin production either in the periplasmic extracts or in the supernatant filtrates compared to the untreated controls.

3.11 VT Levels Increased after SCFA Mixture
A similar experiment to investigate the verotoxin secreted into the supernatant and that retained in the periplasmic space were conducted for bacteria exposed to SCFA. Levels of secreted verotoxin (in the supernatant) and verotoxin retained in the periplasmic space formed with SCFA-stressed 86-24 were determined by measuring the absorbance of crystal violet with an ELISA plate reader. Interestingly, SCFA mixture treatment resulted in significantly increased Stx production in both supernatant filtrates and periplasmic extracts compared to untreated controls. In contrast, acetate induced Stx production was significantly dropped compared to unshocked control. However, butyrate and propionate treatments did not affect the Stx production of either secreted or periplasmic levels (Figures 3.11-1 and 3.11-2). These results suggest that SCFAs mixture that mimics the human colon condition increases VT production.

The initial and final bacteria concentrations of SCFA treated E. coli 0 157:H7 86-24 were measured either by plate count or OD 600 to confirm that the initial inoculums and growth during verotoxin production were the same across all treatments. After SCFA stress, a plate count assay (n=3) was completed to determine the initial CFU/ml for each treatment. Following overnight growth, the OD600 of each treatment was taken and converted to a fmal CFU/mL using a standard curve previously completed. OD 600 results are from two independent experiments and the results are the means ± standard deviations. For both final and initial bacteria concentrations, P < 0.05.

4 Discussion
4.1 Effect of Intestinal Stress on E. coli 0157:H7 Survival: Summary
The ability to adapt to environmental stresses, such those imposed by human hosts, is critical for survival and proliferation of EHEC strains within their hosts (Merrell and Camilli, 2002). When these bacteria enter their hosts they must respond to the extreme and rapidly changing conditions such as gastric acid, BS and organic acids which challenge their ability to grow (Merrell and Camilli, 2002). The effects of human intestinal tract stresses on E. coli 0157:H7 survival and pathogenicy are not entirely understood. Studies on how these bacteria respond to these stress conditions will allow us to understand how exposure to any of these stressors may influence subsequent survival and ability to colonize and proliferate.

4.1.1 Bile Salt Mix Treatment Enhances E. coli 0157:H7 Survival

To survive in the human intestinal tract, E. coli 0157:H7 must tolerate high levels ofBSs in the upper small intestine at physiological concentrations of between 0.1 - 1.3% (Pumbwe et a!., 2007). BSs have detergent like properties which can permeabilize bacterial membranes and can lead to membrane collapse (Begley et a!., 2005). Several pathogens including, E. coli 0157:H7, have adapted mechanisms to evade the antimicrobial activity of BSs. Various effects of BSs on bacteria have been observed after exposure which depend on factors including the type, length and severity of the stress, the growth phase of the organism, and the ability of different strains to survive the encountered stress. For example de Jesus and colleagues (2005) reported significant reductions in viability of BS stressed EPEC relative to that of untreated controls. Another study by Pumbwe et a!. (2007) demonstrated that B. fragilis exposed to 0.15% BS mixture extracted from porcine bile had a longer lag phase, and slower growth rate compared with bacteria grown with media alone.

70

In contrast Pace et al. (1997) showed that pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus strains have the ability to survive to levels 0.5- 1log higher on the agar containing 0.15% oxgall bile compared with strains grown in the presence of no bile. Little difference was observed in survival of non-virulent strains of the bacterium with 0.15% bile. However, when pathogenic strains were grown on plates containing higher concentrations of bile (1.5%), it resulted in reduced survival. Interestingly, this effect was particularly pronounced for non-virulent strains suggesting that virulent strains appear to be more resistant to bile inhibitory activity (Pace et al., 1997). Additionally, other studies have shown that L. monocytogenes is capable of colonizing the human gall bladder indicating an ability to tolerate high concentrations of bile (Allerberger and Guggenbichler, 1989; Briones et al., 1992; Begley et al., 2002). The role of BS in this context has not been fully explored in E. coli 0157:H7 strains, and therefore in this study we investigated the contribution of BS stress to the survival capability of the bacteria. Therefore, it is possible that BS exposure might increase EHEC survival. In the present study, the ability of mid-log phase E. coli 0157:H7 to survive BS exposure at physiological concentrations was examined. BS treated cells were found to survive better on agar compared with untreated cells, after exposure to either three major individual components of BS (cheno, deoxy, glycocholate) or BS mixture. The viability of BS treated EHEC increased 1.2 - 1.4 fold relative to that of untreated EHEC (p ::;; 0.05). These findings are not surprising as the most commonly-used selective media for detection of E. coli 0157:H7 is sorbitol- MacConkey agar (SMAC medium) which contains BS (March and Ratnam, 1986). Interestingly, studies of the impact of acid stress on E. coli 0157:H7 revealed significantly lower survival of the cells compared to the untreated controls (House et al., 2006). It is possible that BS present in the small intestine may favour growth ofEHEC to facilitate recovery from the acid stress of gastric passage and proliferation prior to entry and colonization in the large intestine.

71

4.1.2 Short Chain Fatty Acids Treatment Reduces E. coli 0157:H7 Survival

E. coli 0157:H7 that survtve and transit the small intestine enter the large intestine where they encounter stresses associated with SCFA. The SCFA concentrations in the human colon, the major site of EHEC colonization, are 110 mM, 70 mM and 20
mM for acetate, propionate and butyrate, respectively (Cummings et a!., 1987;

Macfarlane et a!., 1992; Lawhon et a!., 2002). It is well documented that SCFA have antimicrobial activity, and they are widely used as preservatives in food products (Maurer et a!., 2005). Organic acids are able to exibit antimicrobial effect by penetrating the bacterial membrane and dissociation into anions in the cytoplasm. Consequently this results in an increase of the internal osmotic pressure and a depletion of cellular energy to maintain a near neutral pH (Ricke, 2003) Various SCFAs including acetate, propionate, and butyrate are produced by the microbial flora of the large intestine such as Lactobacillus sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Bacteroides sp. These resident flora can enhance host defence by producing SCFA that in tum create an unfavorable environment for enteric pathogens (Lu and Walker, 2001). On the other hand, enteric pathogens including E. coli, Shigella and Salmonella appear to only generate acetate. Acetate can pass through the bacterial membrane into the cytoplasm where it dissociates, generates a large accumulation of anions and lower internal pH (Maurer et a!., 2005). Growth inhibition occurs as a result of lower pH and the ability of anions to inhibit metabolism (Salmond eta!., 1984). This evidence was supported by recent studies which revealed that acetate concentrations increase as bacterial density increases (Arnold eta!., 2001; Kirkpatrick et a!., 2001 ). Other studies have also shown that SCFAs can have inhibitory effects on Salmonella growth and colonization of gastrointestinal tract. However, there are no previous studies that have addressed the role of SCFA on EHEC pathogenesis. We reasoned that exposure to SCFA may decrease EHEC survival. Because the

gastrointestinal tract contains a mixture of acetate, propionate and butyrate, individual SF CAs as well as a mixture of SCFAs were investigated for their affects on EHEC. The survival of the cells with exposure to acetate, propionate, butyrate and the mixture was significantly lower than untreated cells by a factor of 1.3 - 1.5 . Here we show for the first

72

time that a mixture of SCFAs predicted to be similar to that present in the human large intestine significantly decreased viability relative to unstressed cells by a factor of 1.3.

4.2 Bile Salt Mix Treatment Enhances E. coli 0157:H7 Adhesion to Epithelial Cells

The ability of many gastrointestinal bacteria including E. coli 0157:H7 to adhere to host is essential for colonization and requires survival through a wide range of changing environments in the human digestive tract, including BS in the small intestine followed by SCFA in the large intestine. Only those pathogens that evade all these host defenses are able to cause infection. Many enteric pathogens have evolved several complex defense mechanisms, which are induced under different environmental conditions dependant on many factors such as growth phase, the type and the severity of the stress encountered (Lu & Walker, 2001). These important stress responses of E. coli 0157:H7 enhance virulence and correlate to the low infectious dose of approximately 100 organisms (de Jesus et a/., 2005). BS have been shown to play a role in host cell adhesion for several gastrointestinal pathogens including Shigella jlexneri, Vibrio
parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes (Pope et a/., 1995; Pace et a,I., 1997;

Begley et al., 2002). Enteropathogenic E. coli which is a related pathogen has also been reported to show enhanced host-cell adhesion following exposure to BS stress (de Jesus
eta/., 2005). Host adhesion of typical EPEC was significantly enhanced by a factor of 1.3

to 2.6 after BS stress. The observed enhanced adhesion was dependent on the different culture conditions employed. Similarly, Torres et a/. (2007) identified that BS increase expression of the afimbrial adhesin (LDA) in atypical EPEC that mediates binding to tissue-cultured cells in a diffuse adherence pattern of aEPEC. Another study by Maroncle
eta/. (2006) reported that Klebsiella pneumoniae host-cell attachment was significantly

increased, mounting a 2-fold higher adhesion than bacteria cultured without bile. The results reported by Pumbwe and colleagues (2007) showed that BS also contribute to enhanced colonization of B . .fragilis through increased bacterial co-aggregation, bacterial host adhesion, biofilm formation and antimicrobial resistance.

73

In addition, research by Hung eta/. (2006) has shown that the gastrointestinal pathogen, V cholerae had a significant increase in biofilm formation in response to bile acids. In this study, various adhesion assays were performed with human epithelial cell lines derived from adenocarcinoma including HEp-2 (laryngeal carcinoma cells) and Caco-2 (colonic adenocarcinoma cells). However, the use of tissue cells that are cultured has the limitation of obtaining approximative results compared with in vivo models. Regardless of the epithelial cell lines used (either HEp-2cells or Caco-2 cells) the E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 strains exposed to BS for 90 min, resulted in significantly enhanced adhesion to host cells after glycocholate and BS mixture treatments compared to the untreated controls. Even though we eliminated the role of several predominant individual components of bile salts in enhanced adhesion, however we could not rule out the role of other additional components of the bile complex such as taurocholate, cholate, cholesterol and phospholipids. Even though the viabilities for these treatments were not significantly different relative to the control cells, E. coli 0157 :H7 strains subjected to BS treatments were able to better adhere to either HEp-2 cells or Caco-2 cells by adhesion enhancement factors that ranged from 1.6 to 3.2 depending on treatment. In agreement with these results, light microscopy photomicrographs of infected Giemsa stained cells demonstrated as well obvious increased adherence of BS mixture and glycocholate treated E. coli 0157:H7 as compared with untreated strains.

E. coli 0157:H7 strain 86-24 had the highest percentage of viable bacteria bound
to Caco-2 cells (>4%) and the lowest adherence levels to HEp-2 cells (2.4 - 2.6%) . EHEC adherence capability after exposure to BS which was also more significantly increased to colonic Caco-2 cells (4x more) than to human non-intestinal HEp-2 cells (2x). Sherman et a/. (1987) have also shown differences associated with host-cell adhesion capabilities. Adherence of clinical 0157:H7 isolates to both HEp-2 and Intestinal 407 cells did not follow the same morphologicy of binding (Sherman et a/., 1987). These results may suggest that EHEC mediates adherence to various epithelial cell lines through recognition of different surface receptors.

74

Since the Caco-2 cell line is a colonic cell line which has characteristics of mature enterocytes and is more similar to the in vivo situation, these results may suggest that the adhesion enhancement seen after BS exposure may be more dramatic in vivo as well. The importance of adhesion in the life style of EHEC is reflected by the high number of different structures bacteria use for adhesion (Wells et al., 2008). Interestingly, Boerlin and collegues (1999) suggested a strong association for Stx2, intimin and increased adherence on HEp-2 cells. Perhaps this synergism is one factor that may contribute to the differences among strain adhesion phenotypes and ultimately severe EHEC-induced diseases as not all 0157:H7 strains produce VT2. In the present study, all of the EHEC 0157:H7 8624 strains used in the adhesion assays were VT2 positive strains Since treatment with BS enhanced the adhesion of 0157:H7 86-24 cells to host cells we wanted to determine if this phenotype was the result of upregulation of the expression of adhesins, and or modifications to existing adhesins. We sought to clarify the role of protein synthesis in the enhanced adhesion phenotype by pretreatment of bacterial cells with erythromycin. Huesca et al. (1996) found that erythromycin, used at concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), can inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. When BS treated E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 were pre-treated with erythromycin, the adhesion enhancement to HEp-2 cells was abrogated. This result

suggests that the enhanced adhesion ofBS stressed E. coli 0157:H7 is likely the result of enhanced expression of existing adhesins and or expression of new adhesin(s). The ability of EHEC to adhere to host cells and subsequently colonize the large intestine is a key virulence trait and a requirement for the production of diarrhea (required for dissemination of the bacteria) (Torres et al., 2005a). To date, intimin is the only well characterized adhesin that appears to be required for intimate adherence to host cells in vivo (Dannenberg et al., 1993; McKee et al., 1995; Torres et al., 2005b). Several

proteins have been implicated as novel EHEC adhesive factors, both fimbrial and nonfimbria!, including long polar fimbriae 2, outer membrane protein A (OmpA), Iha, and Efa-1 (EHEC factor for adherence) (Nicholls et al., 2000; Tarr et al., 2000; Paton et al., 2001; Stevens et al., 2002). In addition, EspA filaments also appear to be important adhesion factors (Garmendia et al., 2005). Since BS stressed E. coli 0157:H7 resulted in enhanced host cell adhesion after two of treatments (glychocolate and BS mixture) we 75

sought to clarify the role of known adhesins in the BS induced increase in EHEC adhesion to epithelial cells. Intimin is the best characterized adhesin and has been clearly demonstrated to play a key role in bacterial adhesion (Donnenberg et al., 1993; McKee et al., 1995; Torres et al. , 2005b). Therefore, it is possible that intimin may play a role in increased adhesion after BS stress. To explore this hypothesis, an intimin mutant of 86-24 (8624
eae~1 0)

and its complemented wild-type 86-24

eae~(pEB31 0)

were used to investigate

the adhesive capacity to human intestinal cells in tissue culture. First it was confirmed that the intimin negative mutant adhered much less than the parental strain or complemented intimin mutant, supporting the notion that intimin serves as a major adhesin (data not shown). We did note an adhesion enhancement of eae mutant after exposure to the BS mixture. The enhancement was 2.3 fold relative to that of the untreated correlate (P < 0.05). Similar adhesion enhancement after treatment with the BS mixture was seen in 86-24 wt (2.1 fold increase) compared to the untreated control, which demonstrates that intimin is likely not the adhesin responsible for enhanced cell adhesion post-BS stress. Complementation of the intimin mutant with pEB31 0 restored adhesion to that of wt levels for both the unstressed and BS-stressed treatments. These results indicate that other colonization factors are involved in the increased adhesion to human intestinal cells after BS-treatment observed in vitro. Since we concluded that intimin was not responsible for the increased bacterial adhesion observed after BS treatment, we choose to investigate another known bacterial adherence-conferring protein (Iha). This protein is another adhesin which has been described in E. coli 0157 :H7 to be involved in bacterial adhesion (Tarr et al., 2000). To confirm that Iha is an adhesin and to exclude the effect of other adhesins, adherence to epithelial cells was assessed using iha positive strains (e.g. 86-24), an ihanegative mutant of 86-24 and a nonpathogenic E. coli strain (ORN172) that naturally lacks iha, as well as this strain complemented with iha on a plasmid. Preliminary results showed that the
86-24(~iha)

mutant adhered significantly less (P < 0.04) than the

parental strain. This is consistent with previous reports, which indicated that Iha plays a role in adhesion of EHEC to host cells (Tarr et al., 2000).

76

Additionally, an adhesion assay was performed for the ORN172(pSK+) (plasmid alone, no iha) and ORN172(piha) and results showed that E. coli ORN172(plha) adhered 4x more than ORN172(pSK+), confirming that iha plays a major role as an adhesion in a non-pathogenic E. coli background. The low levels of adherence in ORN172(pSK+) can likely be attributed to type I fimbriae (Tarr et al., 2000). No significantly increased adherence was observed in either ORN172(piha) or ORN172(pSK+) after BS mix treatment as compared with untreated strains, suggesting that Iha is not responsible for the increase in adherence observed after BS stress, in these strains. This suggests that other adhesins or virulence factors that are not present in laboratory strains might be necessary to cause an increased adhesion after BS stress. In order to confirm these results, protein expression under the same conditions needs to be examined. Further research is needed to fully explore the roles that these virulence factors have in host adhesion ofBS stressed E. coli 0157:H7 and their possible effects on Stx production.

4.3 Short Chain Fatty Acid Stress Enhances Adhesion of E. coli 0157:H7 to Epithelial Cells
In order to establish infection, E. coli 0157 :H7 must finally overcome the short chain fatty acid stress environment of the large intestine. SCFA represent approximately two-thirds of the colonic anion concentration (1 00-300 mM) mainly as acetate, propionate and butyrate (Cummings et al., 1987). It has been shown that gastrointestinal pathogens including EHEC possess sophisticated protective mechanisms to survive these conditions (Bearson et al., 1997; Kwon and Ricke, 1998; Durant et al., 1999; Ricke, 2003). Maintenance of this competitive edge is a prerequisite for efficient colonization and establishing infection of the large intestine by food-borne pathogens. Significant research has been devoted to understanding the complex regulatory systems that mediate E. coli response to the external environment. However, there is very little information on the potential role of SCFA on virulence of gastrointestinal pathogens. To date several studies have demonstrated that bacteria exhibit enhanced virulence after SCFA stress. For example, Durant et al. (2000) showed that SCFA exposure increases the ability of stationary phase Salmonella typhimurium to adhere to 77

HEp-2 cells. Recently another study by Rishi et al. (2005) reported that SCFA exposure of Salmonella enterica increased intracellular survival within macrophages, induced an acid tolerance response and enhanced expression of outer membrane matrix proteins (porins). According to Polen et al. (2003), E. coli growth in acetate and propionate showed enhanced flagellar motility. In contrast with previous studies, two other reports provided evidence for suppression of motility and chemotaxis at high pH (Polen et al., 2003). It is clear from these contradictory reports that the role of SCFA on virulence of
E. coli 0157 :H7 in the host gastrointestinal tract is still currently unknown.

Since there are no previous studies that have addressed the role of SCFA on EHEC adherence capability, the present study aimed to clarify whether SCFA stress has any impact on EHEC adhesion to epithelial cells. Interestingly, the adhesion of SCFA stressed EHEC to HEp-2 cells was significantly higher compared to untreated EHEC (p < 0.05). Adhesion-enhancement factors ranged from 1.2 - 1.4, depending on SCFA treatment. We reasoned that the SCFA-induced adhesion of E. coli 0157:H7 to host cells might be conferred by increased synthesis of existing or new adhesins. To determine whether the adhesion enhancement is a result of increased expression of adhesins, erythromycin, below the MIC, was used to block protein synthesis (de Jesus et al., 2005). Following SCFA-stress, all treatments were incubated with or without erythromycin and the adhesion of E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 to HEp2 cells was examined. Pretreatment of SCFA stressed bacteria with erythromycin completely abolished the increased host adhesion capability of E. coli 0157 :H7 to Caco-2 cells compared to that of untreated sample. These results indicate that a specific set of proteins synthesized within 30 min, after cells are exposed to SCFAs mixture, are responsible for the increased adhesion to host cells. Further studies are required to identify the nature of the adhesive factors involved in SCFA stressed increased adhesion.

4.4 The Effect of Bile Salts and Short Chain Fatty Acids Treatments on E. coli 0157:H7 Growth during Infection Time
The enhanced adhesion to host epithelial cells by BS and SCFA stressed E. coli 0157:H7 might be due to increased growth during infection time that may arise after BS

78

or short chain fatty acid stress. To confirm this hypothesis, control adhesion assays were employed. E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 was treated with either BS or SCFA and incubated without epithelial cells, simulating the adhesion assays previously described. Bacteria were then plated out and quantified. Three of the treatments showed significantly higher final viability compared to the control. These results indicate that the enhanced adhesion of BS stressed E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 may be due in part to increased growth during infection time after stress. This is actually not a surprising observation since the viability of BS stressed EHEC with three of the treatments was increased relative to that of unshocked. On the other hand, unexpected results were obtained on EHEC growth during infection time after SCF A stress. Although there were no significant differences in initial amount of bacteria loaded, after 4 hr incubation time the survival of all stressed bacteria was significantly lower in comparison to control. Therefore it is likely that enhanced adhesion after SCFA exposure is not mediated through increased growth during incubation time. Further studies will be needed to identify the requirements necessary for that butyrate and mixture adhesion enhancement.

4.5 The Effect of Bile Salts and Short Chain Fatty Acids Treatment on E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 Verotoxin Production:
Stx production by EHEC 0157:H7 is the primary virulence factor associated with the development of the life threatening HUS and vascular complications of HC (Karmali
et al. , 1983). Karmaly et al. , (1985) reported that verotoxin production is strain variable

and classified Shiga-like toxin producing E. coli as low- to moderate-and high level toxin producers. The authors also suggested that Stx accumulated into the periplasmic space is released into the supernatant due to a leaky outer membrane (Karmali et al. , 1985). Recently a study by House et al. , (2006) examined the effect of acid shock of EHEC 0157:H7 86-24 on verotoxin production and secretion. No significant difference was found in verotoxin secreted in the supernatant and that one retained in the periplasmic space, suggesting that acid shock does not augument the severity of EHEC induced renal disease. Additional concern is that Shiga toxin has also been reported to enhance EHEC binding to epithelial cells which could lead to increased colonization, HC and its 79

complications. One study by Robinson et al. (2006) reported that Stx2 produced during infection increases the cell surface expression of nucleolin and helps EHEC in promoting intestinal colonization. That Stx2 provides an adherence advantage ofEHEC 0157:H7 in establishing infection was supported by the finding that wt EHEC 86-24 adhere better to epithelial cells than the stx2 isogenic mutant (Robinson et al., 2006). Epithelial cells that were exposed to enzymatically active Stx2 toxin throughout the infection period not only harmed the host but also enhanced the bacterial adherence level of stx2 isogenic mutants. This increased adherence of isogenic mutants correlated with toxin exposure was even higher to HEp-2 cells than its wt 86-24 alone. These findings are in agreement with their previous report that demonstrated that intimin interacts not only with Tir as a receptor but also with the eukaryotic protein nucleolin localized on the cell surface (Sinclair & O'Brien, 2002). Similar results were obtained by Barnett Foster et al, (2000) that demonstrated an enhanced adhesion of EHEC to Stx-treated epithelial cells. This finding was correlated with increased levels of outer leaflet phosphatidyletanolamine, the host receptor previously reported to bind EHEC (Barnett Foster et al., 2000). This study investigated the impact of BS and SCFA treatment on both secreted and periplasmic production of verotoxin. It is important to assay the levels of both secreted and periplasmic production because it is well documented that antimicrobial treatment of EHEC infections can activate the Stx phage thereby releasing the toxin accumulated in the periplasmic space and increasing the risk of HUS (Bushen and Guerrant, 2003; Kaper et al., 2004).

4.5.1 No Change in Secreted and Periplasmic VT Production after Bile Salt Treatment
Firstly, the impact of BS stress on Stx production (both secreted and periplasmic extracts) of E. coli 0157:H7 86-24 was examined. The results of the Vero cell cytotoxicity assay showed no significant changes in toxin production either in the supernatant filtrates or periplasmic extract across all BS various treatments. Since no significant differences were found across all the various treatments, it is likely that BS stress does not augment the severity of EHEC induced renal disease. 80

4.5.2 Increased VT Levels after Short Chain Fatty Acids Mixture Stress
Having shown the impact of BS on Stx production, further investigation was conducted to determine whether the Stx levels were altered by SCFA stress. SCFAmixture treatment resulted in a significant increase in Stx production in both supernatant filtrates and periplasmic extracts compared to untreated controls. In contrast, acetate induced Stx production was significantly lower compared to untreated controls. Butyrate and propionate treatments did not affect the Stx production, either secreted or periplasmic. These data suggest that exposure to an SFCA mixture almost similar to that of the large intestine increases Stx production and extrapolated to the in vivo situation, may augment the severity of EHEC induced renal disease by increasing levels of Stx produced. This is consistent with the proposed mechanism in which environmental signals in the colon serve as cue for bacterial infection (Gyles eta!., 2006). Research by Louise et a!. (1995) showed that butyrate increases the number of Stx receptors on HUVEC cell surface. Although it is tempting to suggest that butyrate may increase Stx binding to Gb3, further study is needed. However, it is possible that E coli 0157:H7 exploits the SCFA microenvironment using it as a signal to seek appropriate opportunities for infection in the large intestine. Further research is required to examine whether other E. coli 0157:H7 strains produce the same observed results observed here under these experimental conditions. A better understanding will be obtained by analyzing the molecular basis of these changes in gene expression induced by BS and SCFA treatments of E. coli 0157:H7.

81

5 Summary and Conclusions
5.1 Summary of Results
This research examines the impact of exposure of EHEC 0157:H7 to physiologically relevant concentrations of BS and SCFA on critical virulence properties including the adhesion to host endothelial cells and the production of Stxs. This study has revealed significant stress-induced changes in a number of these properties including survival, ability to adhere to human epithelial cells and verotoxin production. Exposure to BS significantly enhanced the survival of EHEC 0157 :H7. It is tempting to speculate that this increase in survival first could facilitate the recovery from the acid stress of the stomach and further promote colonization in the large intestine. There was also significantly increased adhesion to tissue culture cells after BS stress. Our investigations on EHEC adherence capability after BS treatment were extended for two different epithelial cell lines and we found that EHEC had the highest percent of viable bacteria bound to Caco-2 cells (4x fold increase) and the lowest adherence level (2x fold increase) to HEp-2 cells. Another interesting finding was that the pretreatment of the bacteria with erythromycin completely abolished the adhesion enhancement of BS stressed EHEC 0157:H7. This suggests that the enhanced adhesion required increased bacterial protein synthesis, presumably of existing or new adhesins. The adhesion increase after BS exposure was likely not mediated by either an intimin or Iha since the same adhesion increase was noted for both the intimin-negative mutant and the Iha negative mutant. On the other hand, a nonpathogenic E. coli strain demonstrated decreased adhesion after BS stress. Adhesion levels of both BS treated and untreated nonpathogenic ORN172 strains were much lower relative to E. coli 0157:H7 strain. No variation of the host adhesion capability of non-virulent laboratory K12 strains to HEp-2 cells indicate that virulence factors not present in the laboratory strains are responsible for an increased level of adhesion to host cells in EHEC. Next, we hypothesized that the enhanced adhesion might be due to increased growth after BS stress. Preliminary data demonstrated that glycocholate, deoxycholate
82

and ursocholate treatments showed significantly higher final viability compared to the control. It is likely possible that the glycocholate treatment may have enhanced the adhesion of E. coli 0157:H7 to epithelial cells through elevated growth after stress. This would suggest that there are more bacteria adhering because there are more bacteria present. These findings are consistent with previous studies in the lab that have also demonstrated that BS treatments significantly enhanced several other virulence properties including motility, flagella expression and resistance to several antibiotics (Prayitno et

al., unpublished data). None of the experimental BS treatments resulted in a significant
change in Stx production in either secreted or periplasmic extracts. These results suggest that BS does not upregulate STx production and so this virulence factor is not expressed at higher levels after BS stress. This could then be used to suggest that BS stress may not lead to increased risk of VT -mediated pathology includind HUS. However, further research needs to clarify wheter more VT is produced that more is translocated into the blood stream and that more reaches the kidneys etc and causes damage. Since VT has also been implicated in increased adhesion of the bacteria, it is unlikely that changes in VT levels could explain the increased adhesion observed for BS-stressed EHEC. It is tempting to speculate that EHEC sense the BS as a signal of being in the small intestine and does not influence the Stx production in order to save resources and promote colonization in more appropriate environments such as the large intestine. Since BS stress may be inducing novel adhesin expression, microarray analysis is currently underway (Barnett Foster, D.E., personal communication). Any potential adhesins upregulated will be confirmed with real time RT-PCR and BS adhesion assays. Having shown the impact of BS on adherence capability and verotoxin production levels, further investigation was conducted to determine whether SCFA stress had any effect on the adhesion and cytotoxicity. SCFA stress, such as that present in the large intestine, significantly induces changes in bacterial survival, ability to adhere to human epithelial cells and verotoxin production. Interestingly, although the survival after

exposure to SCFAs was significantly lower than that of untreated control, it seems that bacteria that survived the stress showed enhanced adhesion capabilities to host epithelial cells. Pretreatment of SCFA stressed E.coli 0157:H7 strains with subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin did not show increased adhesion to host epithelial cells.
83

These data again support the idea that protein synthesis was required for the increased adhesion phenotype and strongly suggest that the adhesion erihancement resulted from increased expression of existing or new adhesins. Treatment with the SCFA-mixture resulted tn significantly increased Stx production in both supernatant filtrates and periplasmic extracts compared to untreated controls. This finding lends support of the concept that EHEC is using local microenvironmental cues to regulate virulence factor expression. The mix of SFCAs approximates that of the local microenvironment of the large intestine and the data suggest that EHEC is responding to this cue by increasing the production of VT in a location where this virulence factor can be translocated across the intestinal epithelial for circulation to body organs including kidneys. Since the bacterial survival is lower after SCFA exposure, the data might also suggest that increased Stx production may assist in enhancing bacterial adhesion. Further work is needed to determine whether Stx mediated adherence contributes to and consolidates the SCFA induced changes. Again, these

findings are consistent with previous studies in the lab that have also proven that SCFA treatments significantly enhanced other several virulence properties including flagella expression (Prayitno et al., unpublished data).

5.2 Future Work
Since the results of this study highlighted changes in virulence factors, the molecular basis of the response of EHEC to localized stress in the small and large intestine should be examined. We hypothesize that the changes in expression of selected virulence factors is a direct response to the localized environmental stress encountered during transition to the small and large intestine. Whole-genome expression profiling (microarray analysis) and real-time PCR are currently underway to examine changes in the expression of genes up- and down-regulated post BS- and SCFA- treatment. This research should begin by focusing on genes encoding adhesin candidates since the most recent data from this study indicate significant changes in host adhesion after specific SCFA stress. Based on these results, the role of these candidate genes in host cell

84

infection should be assessed by constructing mutants defective in the individual genes and then should be tested in phenotypic virulence assays. This study has highlighted changes in several virulence factors including adhesion to host tissues; the role( s) of known bacterial adhesins after BS and SCFA stress needs to be clarified. BS and SCFA adhesion assays with espA, iha and intimin mutants should be completed. Furthermore, Western blot analysis should be employed to assess expression levels of intimin, Iha and EspA in BS and SCFA-treated organisms. Additionally, the secretion phenotypes of BS and SCF A stressed E. coli 0157 :H7 should also be examined to further explore the possible posttranscriptional regulation of these virulence factors after either BS or SCFA treatments. The role of other potential adhesins, such as OmpA, EspA, long polar fimbriae 2, and Efa-1 should also be examined after either BS or SCFA stress. Adhesion assays with parental and mutant strains for each adhesin should be conducted. Microscopic investigation would also be useful to determine if there are differences between stressed and unstressed strains. This research will enhance our understanding of stress-induced virulence changes in this serious, potentially lifethreatening gastrointestinal pathogen and explain the genetic basis of these changes.

5.3 Significance and Conclusions
It is obvious that most bacterial pathogens including E. coli 0157:H7 must overcome hostile conditions, such those encountered in the intestinal tract, in order to successfully reach their target sites on the surface of enterocytes (Merrell and Camilli, 2002; Foster, 2004). The results of this study show that the environmental conditions of the human host, such as BS of the small intestine and SCFA of the large intestine, directly influence essential virulence factors involved in the intestinal colonization process of E. coli 0157:H7 including bacterial attachment to epithelial cells as well as verotoxin production. Interestingly, this work suggests for the first time that E. coli 0157:H7 uses BS and SCFA as a cue to establish location and influence virulence gene expression. The production of verotoxin is the major virulence factor in EHEC infection since it can ultimately lead to several life threatening diseases such as hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombic thrombocytopenic purpoura. SCFA stress did significantly increased verotoxin production. This finding is significant and supports the idea that

85

exposure to SCFA stress will lead to increased cases of HUS due to increased verotoxin production. Adhesion to host cells is an important virulence factor of EHEC infection. Although not associated with the severe life threatening disease, adherence to host epithelial cells is still a requirement for the development of diarrhea (Tzipori et a!., 1987; Campellone and Leong, 2003). Since BS treatment has enhanced survival and adhesion capability to the host cells, the severity of EHEC-induced diarrhea may be increased and may occur faster in infected individuals. Taken together, these results indicate that E. coli is able to survive in hostile conditions, reproducing stresses encountered in the intestinal tract, a prerequisite for successful propagation of the microorganisms. However, the higher levels of adhesion to intestinal cells observed with SCFA stress could be attributed to an advantage due to the increased verotoxin production. The results of this research indicate that ingestion stresses such as BS and SCFA, which are part of the host's natural chemical assault on foreign organisms, may actually enhance the virulence properties of this pathogen including adhesion to human epithelial cells, Stx production, motility and flagella expression, resistance to several antibiotics contributing to, rather than, preventing infection. Furthermore, they suggest that this pathogen may use these ingestion stresses to cue the expression of numerous virulence factors for successful infection of local microenvironments. This work makes a valuable contribution to understanding how these stresses modulate the virulence potential of this pathogen. In addition, we have contributed

essential data for delineating the pathogenesis of disease caused by EHEC infection. Continued work in this field will surely contribute to identifying new genes and pathways involved in BS and SCFA stress-induced virulence changes. These data, combined with other results, may provide exciting possible alternatives for the treatment or prevention of EHEC infections. It may allow the design of a new class of antimicrobials that can block BS and SCFA signaling in bacterial pathogens. These potential antimicrobials will not only be useful against EHEC but possibly also against other pathogens which harbor similar response to stress. We can conclude that our hypothesis was correct. Finally, our results support the hypothesis that environmental stresses such as BS or SCFA encountered during transition to the small and large intestine increase EHEC virulence including host cell adhesion and toxin production. 86
