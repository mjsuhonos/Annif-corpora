CLONING, EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION OF THE CYTOKINE FLT3-LIGAND FOR PROTEIN INTERACTION STUDIES! Lauren Alicia Agro M.Sc. in Molecular Science, Ryerson University, 2011

ABSTRACT The FLT3-FLT3L receptor complex is responsible for the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells, and is involved in several hematological malignancies. A truncated, soluble form of FLT3L was amplified from the fulllength sequence by PCR and cloned into a genomic integration and expression vector for Kluyveromyces lactis. Expression and secretion of the 161 amino acid FLT3L was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot and showed smeared bands around 50kDa consistent with a high level of varying glycosylation as expected. A yield of 100ug/mL of culture was obtained. Purification was performed by Ni-affinity chromatography and the protein was confirmed to be in the elution fraction via mass spectrometry analysis. Purified FLT3L was able to activate RAW264.7 cells after 24hr incubation period causing large vacuoles and a dendritic appearance. FLT3L will be utilized for LARC protein interaction studies to search for interactors that might serve as therapeutic agents in human body fluids and cell culture models of myeloid leukemia. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

INTRODUCTION

Cell signalling is fundamental to life and cellular function. Cells receive a constant flow of information from membrane receptor proteins regarding the extracellular environment and as a result, the intracellular environment is altered accordingly. These signal transductions within the cell are highly sensitive and specific. Receptors have a high affinity for their specific ligands, and when a ligand-receptor complex is formed, a very specific cell response occurs via intracellular enzyme cascades. In animals, some membrane receptors regulate cell differentiation, growth, proliferation and death. When these receptors become mutated, they are often able to initiate a cellular signal cascade without the attachment of their complementary ligand. One frequent outcome of this is uncontrolled cellular division and tumor growth, ultimately leading to cancer. In order to work towards possible cures, it is important to understand the cause of these mutations, where they occur, and what happens inside of the cell when these signal cascades are activated. One popular method of determining intracellular protein-protein interactions is to do coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments (Sambrook & Russell, 2001). Protein-protein associations are often preserved when cells are lysed under non-dentauring conditions, so proteins which associate with each other may be able to precipitate together (Sambrook & Russell, 2001). In Co-IP, an antibody against the target protein is selected and `pulls' that protein out of a solution of cell lysates (Sambrook & Russell, 2001). If the target protein is part of a larger complex of proteins and is bound to its other interactor proteins, theoretically, those proteins will elute together along with the target protein. (Sambrook & Russell, 2001). Elutions are fractionated by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and detected by Western blot using an antibody towards proteins of interest (Sambrook & Russell, 2001). However, it is often difficult to isolate assembled receptor complexes from membranebound receptors since complete protein complexes may only assemble in live cells due to various factors including, but not limited to, the inclusion of the membrane and cytoskeleton-associated binding partners that would not normally reform in cell lystaes (Jankowski et al, 2008). Therefore, a method needs to be developed so that whole receptor complexes can be extracted
S! ! !

from live cells. One such method is called live cell affinity chromatography (LARC), which uses a ligand attached to a microbead in order to activate and capture the full ligand-receptor complex from live cells (Jankowski et al, 2008). This method is able to capture fully assembled receptor complexes in their native state and is more sensitive and efficient than Co-IP (Jankowski et al, 2008). However, LARC requires large amounts of the ligand protein in order to do multiple trials of extraction experiments. Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop a protocol to obtain large amounts of the desired ligand. Here we develop a protocol to clone, express, and purify a soluble form of FLT3L for the purpose of LARC.

FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 The FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor (FLT3), also known as stem cell kinase-1 and fetal liver kinase-2, was first cloned in mouse fetal liver and placenta cells (Matthews et al, 1991; Rosnet et al, 1991). Later the human FLT3 gene (found on chromosome 13q12) was cloned with 86% amino acid sequence homology with murine FLT3 (Rosnet et al, 1993b; Small et al, 1994). The human FLT3 gene encodes a 993 amino acid protein belonging to the receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (RTK3) family (Agnes et al, 1994). The FLT3 membrane bound receptor includes the following features; five immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains, a single transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, two intracellular tyrosine kinase domains linked by a kinase insert and 24 exons (Figure 1) (Abu-Duhier et al, 2001; Agnes et al, 1994). More recently, it was found that a zinc finger called Fiz1 binds to the catalytic domain of FLT3 (Wolf & Rohrschneider, 1999). Like all RTK3 members, FLT3 plays a role in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of haematopoietic cells (Rosnet et al, 1993c). Additional RTK3 members include macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (FMS), steel factor receptor (KIT) and receptors for plateletderived growth factors (PDGFR) A and B (Agnes et al, 1994). Two forms of human FLT3 exist including a 158-160kDa membrane bound protein glycosylated at external N-linked glycosylation sites, and a 130-143kDa protein that lacks membrane binding (Lyman et al, 1993a; Carow et al, 1996). Normal human cells express FLT3 in early CD34+ myeloid and lymphoid progenitors while avoiding erythroid cells, megakaryocytes or mast cells (Rosnet et al, 1996;
(! ! !

Gabbianelli et al, 1995; Ratajczak et al, 1996; Hiertson et al, 1996). The developmental stages at which hematopoietic progenitors express FLT3 are unknown (Karsunky et al, 2003). FLT3 is very important in the development of leukemia, as its mutations are involved in

as multipotent colony-forming or myeloid-committed colony forming cells while B-cell ALL originates from immature progenitor B cells (Sabbath et al, 1985; Nadler et al, 1984). The chronic leukemias rarely express FLT3 due to the involvement of more mature lymphoctyes and cells that retain differentiation, resulting in the loss of FLT3 expression (Rubartelli et al, 1983; Martin et al, 1980). Recently, it has been found that ALL patients with translocations in the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene, overexpressed wildtype FLT3 which may indicate that certain genetic interruptions influence FLT3 expression (Armstrong et al, 2002).

FMS-like tyrosine kinase ligand The mouse FLT3L gene was cloned first and the resulting cDNA was subsequently used to clone the human FLT3L gene (Lyman et al, 1993b; Hannum et al, 1994; Lyman et al, 1994a). The FLT3L gene encodes 232 and 235 amino acids in the mouse and human respectively and results in a 73% homology at the amino acid level (Figure 2) (Stephen et al, 1997). The human FLT3L extracellular region is 73% similar in mouse while the cytoplasmic domain is only 52%
N! ! !

similar (Lyman et al, 1998). The FLT3L is a type 1 transmembrane protein containing a 26 residue amino-terminal signalling peptide, four extracellular helical domains consisting of 156 residues, spacer and tether regions, a 23 residue transmembrane domain and a 30 residue cytoplasmic domain (Figure 3) (Lyman et al, 1998; Lyman et al, 1995a; Graddis et al, 1998). Lyman et. al (1993) predicated the molecular weight to be 23.164kDa after cleavage of the signal sequence with an estimated pI of 8.17. Both the KIT ligand and FMS ligand share intron/exon boundaries, sizes, and structures with FLT3 indicating ancestral relatedness (Lyman et al, 1998). The spacer and tether regions of the ligand link the active extracellular component to the transmembrane domain and anchors it to the cell. The cytoplasmic domain is reported to be uninvolved in stimulation of FLT3 and the function of this region is unknown (Lyman et al, 1998).

Like FLT3, there are a number of isoforms of FLT3L. The main human isoform is a full length transmembrane protein that is cleaved by TNF-! converting enzyme (TACE) in the spacer and tether region to produce a soluble isoform that is released into circulation (Hannum et al, 1994; Lyman et al, 1994b; Graddis et al, 1998; Horiuchi et al, 2009). Soluble FLT3L does not contain a carboxyl end and consists mainly of the extracellular portion of the protein. This soluble, noncovalently linked dimer contains 6 cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds (Lyman et al, 1998; Graddis et al, 1998). A rare soluble human FLT3L isoform has an alternatively spliced exon 6 resulting in an early stop codon (Lyman et al, 1998). In mice, the most abundant form of FLT3L is the membrane bound 220 amino acid protein that results from a failure to splice out an intron which creates a frame shift mutation encoding hydrophobic amino acids keeping the ligand at the cell surface (Lyman et al, 1998). Because this mutation causes an absence of the tether, spacer, and other regions that attach the ligand to the membrane, proteolytic cleavage does not occur (Lyman et al, 1995c). Another isoform of mouse FLT3L has an altered exon 6 splice much like the human equivalent (Lyman et al, 1998). Isoform relevance and expression preference in various tissues is currently unknown (Lyman et al, 1998). All human and murine FLT3L variants are biologically active but the relative activity is undetermined (Lyman et al, 1998). FLT3L does not show species specificity, which is contrary to other RTK ligands (Lyman et al, 1994a).

Expression of FLT3L occurs in most tissues including; haematopoietic organs, prostate, ovary, kidney, lung, colon, small intestine, testis, heart, and placenta. Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells are found to have the highest FLT3L expression levels, with the brain showing little expression (Brasel et al, 1995; Meierhoff et al, 1995). Due to the extensive expression of FLT3L in comparison to low levels of FLT3 expression, FLT3 is considered the limiting factor in receptor-ligand activation (Lyman et al, 1995b). Serum levels of FLT3L are low in adults but seem to be inducible as evidenced by patients who have low white blood cell counts secondary to haematopoietic disease or chemotherapy who show increased serum concentrations of FLT3L in an attempt to encourage heamatopoiesis (Lyman et al, 1995b). This has been exploited in murine models to promote mobilization of haematopoietic stem cells with some success and in human trials to treat prostate cancer (Ashihara, 1998). More recently, Zhang et al. (2009) studied the effect of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and FLT3L over-expression in human cord blood CD34+ cells on rescuing lethally irradiated mice by transplantation. Isolated CD34+ cells were infected with a recombinant retrovirus expressing FLT3L, IL-3 or FLT3L/IL3 genes (Zhang et al, 2009). Results showed more human cells could be found in the bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood of mice transplanted with the cells expressing FLT3L/IL-3 (Zhang et al, 2009). These mice also showed a greater recovery of peripheral blood counts and a much higher survival rate (Zhang et al, 2009). It is reasonable to believe that the further study of recombinant FLT3L as a treatment for various cancers would be valuable.

Receptor-Ligand activation and degradation FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 exists in an inactive monomer state in the plasma membrane (Gonfloni et al, 2000). Inactive monomers have a structural conformation that results in steric inhibition of dimerization by having the juxtamembrane domain cover the phosphoryl acceptor sites in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) (Gonfloni et al, 2000). This type of inhibition is consistent with other members of the RTK family (Gonfloni et al, 2000). After FLT3L stimulation, FLT3 undergoes a conformational change that exposes the phosphoryl acceptor sites to form a homodimer with another ligand bound FLT3 (Turner et al, 1996). The dimerization causes an increase in stability of the receptor complex and enhances receptor activation (Weiss & Schlessinger, 1998). Once FLT3 has bound, phosphorylation of the TKD occurs within 5-15
)! ! !

minutes. After 5-15 minutes of stimulation, the receptor complex is engulfed by the cell and degradation products appear after approximately 20 minutes (Figure 4) (Weiss & Schlessinger, 1998). This rapid turnover of FLT3 is also consistent with other RTK3 receptors like KIT (Yee et al, 1993). The regulation of FLT3 production and degradation is most likely the result of complex feedback loops that are yet to be fully described. Low serum FLT3L concentrations and the close location of cells that highly express FLT3L to early progenitor haematopoietic cells containing FLT3, indicates receptor activation may be controlled via paracrine methods (Brasel et al, 1995). Autocrine feedback loops may also be involved, supported by the co-expression of FLT3L and FLT3 in the same cell allowing the cell to regulate its own level of FLT3 activation (Brasel et al, 1995). This autocrine regulation is also consistent with other growth factors like granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and its associated receptor (Rogers et al, 1994).

Figure 4. Life cycle of the FLT3 receptor. Transcription of the FLT3 gene results in mRNA, which is translated to FLT3 protein. Cytoplasmic FLT3 undergoes glycosylation, which promotes localization of the receptor to the membrane. When a FLT3L (L) dimer binds the monomeric receptor, it initiates receptor dimerization. Receptor dimerization promotes phosphorylation (P) of the tyrosine-kinase domains, which activates the receptor and downstream effectors. The dimerized receptors are quickly internalized and degraded after about 15-20 minutes. Image adapted from Stirewalt et al, 2003.

FLT3 known associated pathways and components Initially, the RTK-RAS pathway was studied using chimeric receptor complexes containing the extracellular ligand-binding domains of human FMS attached to the intracellular catalytic domains of mouse FLT3 (Dosil et al, 1993; Rottapel et al, 1994). Activation of this receptor complex with colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) transformed mouse cell lines resulted in cell proliferation without the aid of additional growth factors (Dosil et al, 1993; Rottapel et al, 1994). It was found that the FMS-FLT3 complex was directly associated with the Src-homology

2 (SH2) domain of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and with growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) (Dosil et al, 1993; Rottapel et al, 1994). It was also found that there was an association with phospholipase C-"1, SH2-containing sequence proteins and GTPase-activating protein (Dosil et al, 1993; Rottapel et al, 1994). This same FLT3 complex is also associated with SH2-domain-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP) (Marchetto et al, 1999). After FLT3L was cloned, direct FLT3-FLT3L studies were conducted with similar results to the pathways associated with the FMS-FLT3 complex (Lyman et al, 1993b; Lyman et al, 1994b). Src homology 2 domain containing (SHC) proteins were phosphorylated and interacted or formed complexes with other proteins like Growth Factor Receptor-bound Protein (GRB), GRB2-associated binder 2, and SHIP (Figure 5) (Marchetto et al, 1999; Zhang et al, 1999a; Lavagna-Sevenier et al, 1998; Zhang et al, 2000a). The adaptor protein complexes most likely mediate downstream molecules in the RAS-RAF-MEK- extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and PI3K pathway much like other RTKs (Zhang et al, 1999a; Zhang et al, 2000a; Srinivasa & Doshi, 2002; Zhang et al, 1999b). Unlike in mice, where p85 binds FLT3 at Y958 in the carboxyl terminus, human FLT3 does not directly associate with the p85 subunit of PI3K. Instead, human FLT3 forms multifaceted associations with GRB2, GAB2, SHIP, SHP2, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (CBL) and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase B (CBLB) which inevitably act on p85 (Zhang et al, 1999a; Zhang et al, 2000a). It was shown that tyrosine residues 572, 589, 591 and 599 are in vivo autophosphorylation sites and that Y599 and Y589 are association sites for signal relay molecules including the SRC family kinases and SHP2 (Heiss et al, 2006). Heiss et. al. (2006) hypothesized that the recruitment of SHP2 to pY599 contributes to P8QN8!3:C"./:C! Erk activation and proliferation. Activation of FLT3 was also found to alter transcription via signal transducer and activators of transcription like signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5A (Zhang et al, 2000a). It has the ability to prevent expression of genes that induce apoptosis like BCL2associated X protein (BAX) (Lisovsky et al, 1996). Additionally, Pim-1, a proto-oncogene upregulated by STAT5, is associated with FLT3, and inhibition of FLT3 resulted in a 10x decrease of Pim-1 expression (Kim et al, 2005). The juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 is critical for PIM-1 upregulation and cell proliferation on BA/F3 cells, however it is independent of the N-terminal

region, which is normally responsible for STAT5, AKT and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation (Krstovski et al, 2009). Also, the FLT3 gene promoter was suppressed by transcription factor PU.1, suggesting an inverse relationship between the two molecules (Inomata et al, 2006). The transcription factor controls dendritic cell (DC) development and flt3 cytokine receptor expression in a dose-dependant manner. As a result, PU.1 positive cells displayed reduced expression of flt3 and impaired DC formation (Carotta et al, 2010). However, FLT3 pathways display high tissue and species specificity which may be a downfall when attempting to correlate results from murine cell lines to human haematopoietic cells (Zhang et al, 1999a; Dosil et al, 1993).

Figure 5. FLT3 signal cascade. Receptor-ligand binding triggers the PI3K and RAS pathways, resulting in increased cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. PI3K activity is regulated through interactions between FLT3, SHC, SHIP, SHP2, CBL, and GAB2. Activated PI3K stimulates proteins such as 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which initiate transcription and translation of regulatory genes through the activation of p70 S6 kinase (S6K) and the inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1). PI3K activation also blocks apoptosis through phosphorylation of BAD. FLT3 also associates with GRB2 through SHC, activating RAS. RAS activation stimulates RAF, MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RSK). These effectors activate cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein (CREB), ELK and signal transducer and STATs which results in transcription of genes involved in proliferation.

Biological significance of FLT3 The activation of FLT3 in vitro causes growth of early progenitor cells (Ray et al, 1996; Veiby et al, 1996; Rusten et al, 1996). Currently, research suggests that FLT3 alone is unable to have a substantive effect on proliferation of early haematopoietic progenitor cells, but it does cause monocytic differentiation (Rusten et al, 1996; Gabbianelli et al, 1995). When FLT3 is activated in the presence of other growth factors like IL-3, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), CSF1, GM-CSF, and KIT ligand, a stronger proliferative response occurs with more granulocytic-monocytic colony forming units being produced (Gabbianelli et al, 1995; Rusten et al, 1996; Shah et al, 1996). Of these other growth factors, the most potent combination has been seen with FLT3L, KIT ligand and IL-3 (Rusten et al, 1996). Since FLT3 is not found in megakaryocytes and erythrocytes, FLT3L has no effect on those cell lines (Gabbianelli et al, 1995). FLT3L stimulation in combination with IL-7 and IL-11 results in long-term clonal expansion and differentiation of murine haematopoietic progenitor cells (Ray et al, 1996). In fetal human bone marrow, FLT3L with IL-7 encourages stromal-cell-independent growth of proB cells and their differentiation to pre-B cells (Namikawa et al, 1996). Deleting IL-7 caused adult B-cell development cessation while fetal cell development continued in mice models. Additionally, residual B-cells in IL-7 receptor deficient mice required FLT3 for development indicating that IL-7 and FLT3 are needed to produce the majority of B lymphocytes (Vosshenrich et al, 2003). There is also a synergistic effect between FLT3L and G-CSF that causes mobilization of stem cells into the blood serum (Streeter et al, 2003). Proliferation and differentiation of T-cells are also affected by FLT3 activation (Hannum et al, 1994; Moore et al, 1997). Also, FLT3 has been shown to be a negative regulator of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine secreted by T cells (Astier et al, 2010). The FLT3 receptor with its ligand normally activates T cells, however when FLT3 was silenced, there was an increase in IL-10 levels (Astier et al, 2010). Alternatively, when FLT3L was added, IL-10 was suppressed while FLT3 receptor levels were increased (Astier et al, 2010). Additionally, engagement of CD46 regulatory type 1 cells also resulted in an increase in the FLT3 surface receptor and secreted FLT3L which led to the inhibition of IL-10 production (Astier et al, 2010). Together the results indicate that the FLT3 pathway forms a regulatory feedback loop resulting in decreased IL-10 in T-cells (Astier et al, 2010).

The FLT3 ligand is a potent stimulator of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), or G-CSF-dependent granulocyte-macrophage committed precursors from Lin- CD34+ bone marrow cells (Piacibello et al, 1995). Although synergistic effects were seen with various combinations of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, or SCF; FLT3L alone induced and increased colony formation by clonogenic precursor cells (Piacibello et al, 1995; Daro et al, 2002). By contrast, FLT3L does not affect the growth of erythroid-committed progenitors even with the addition of EPO (Piacibello et al, 1995). When comparing FLT3L free stimulation with FLT3L in combination with IL-3, IL-6, and IL-7, there is a two to six fold increase in the amount of primitive thymic progenitors (Moore et al, 1997). In murine knockout studies, FLT3 deficient mice displayed little or no morphological bone marrow changes and fairly normal haematopoiesis except for a small reduction in pro and pre-B cell compartments (Mackarehtschian et al, 1995). Knockouts of both KIT and FLT3 proved to be fatal due to haematopoietic complications. As a result, it is evident that FLT3 plays an important role in haematopoiesis but that this role is not total, as it must cooperate with other growth factors to illicit a full differentiation and proliferative response in myeloid and lymphoid cells (Mackarehtschian et al, 1995). This is clinically relevant as one may inhibit FLT3 in leukemic conditions without the patient encountering too severe haematopoietic side-effects. After the success of FLT3L working synergistically with many interleukins, interleukin16 (IL-16) and 18 (IL-18) were analyzed. Interluekin-16 was added to a cocktail comprised of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interluekin-4 (IL-4), FLT3L and TACE (Della Bella et al, 2004). This combination was able to induce the CD34(+) hematopoietic cells to proliferate in vitro and to differentiate into phenotypically and functionally mature DCs (Della Bella et al, 2004). Furthermore, tumors of mice were injected with FLT3L, IL-18, or a combination of both and it was found that FLT3L alone was able to eliminate the tumors more than IL-18 alone (Saito et al, 2008). Additionally, the lymphoid cells in the lymph nodes of the mice had significant cytolytic activity against the tumor cells (Saito et al, 2008). The combination of FLT3L and IL-18 caused recruitment of mobilized DC into the tumor bed and a more potent allogeneic T cell stimulation (Saito et al, 2008). Antigen-presenting dendritic cell development is also promoted by FLT3 activation which leads to clonal expansion of dendritic

cells in bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and blood serum (Saunders et al, 1996; Maraskovsky et al, 1996; Morse et al, 2000). This finding suggests FLT3L stimulation may boost immune response to tumors and is supported by evidence indicating a reduction in murine solid and haematopoietic tumors. The same studies done in humans have shown mixed response (Lynch et al, 1997; Chen et al, 1997; Chakravarty et al, 1999; Pawlowska et al, 2001; Parajuli et al, 2001). Furthermore, there seems to be a co-expression of FLT3 and Meis1, a transcription factor oncoprotein often expressed with Homeobox A9 (Hoxa9) in AML (Wang et al, 2005). Overexpression of Meis1 results in increased FLT3 transcription which then synergizes with NUP98-HOX to increase proliferation of myeloid progenitors blocked in differentiation by NUP98-HOX fusion (Palmqvist et al, 2006). This indicates that FLT3 has a direct role in an AML outcome. In vivo, overexpression of FLT3L expands splenic natural killer dendritic cells (NKDC) from 2 to 18 fold (Zhang et al, 2009). These cells are able to secrete IFN-gamma, directly lyse tumor cells, and can present antigens to T cells, thereby having immunotherapeutic potential (Zhang et al, 2009). The FLT3L induced expansion of the cells result in NKDC with a more mature phenotype and a slightly increased ability to capture and process antigen (Zhang et al, 2009). Overall, FLT3L has been found to be the most potent growth factor for DC generation both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in its continued research in immunotherapy due to its ability to present tumor antigens to T-cells and irradiate tumors (Zhang et al, 2005).

FLT3 mutations and effects FLT3 mutations were first described in by Nakao et al (1996). The most common mutation is a internal tandem duplication (ITD) in exons 14 and 15 (Nakao et al, 1996). This mutation occurs in 15-35% of AML patients and 5-10% of MDS patients (Horiike et al, 1997; Xu et al, 1999; Kiyoi et al, 1999; Kottaridis et al, 2001; Yokota et al, 1997; Brown et al, 2004). The ITD phenotype occurs when a portion of the juxtamembrane region sequence is duplicated and inserted head to tail (Schnittger et al, 2002). The reading frame is conserved and the ITD can vary from 3 to greater than 400bp (Schnittger et al, 2002). These ITD mutations result in ligandindependent dimerization causing auto-phosphorylation and continuous receptor activation (Kiyoi et al, 1998; Hayakawa et al, 2000; Kiyoi et al, 2002; Mizuki et al, 2000). How this mutation mediates constitutive activation is currently unknown, however it is thought that the
S*! ! !

mutation in the juxtamembrane region may result in a loss of the regions that prevent FLT3 ligand dependent dimerization (Kiyoi et al, 2002). The mutated receptor is shown to dimerize and activate wildtype FLT3 even in the absence of a tyrosine kinaase domain (TKD) (Kiyoi et al, 2002). Similar mutations with constitutive signalling have been documented in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) (Gille et al, 2000). These internal duplications may also alter the monomeric receptor conformation to expose the phosphoryled acceptor sites in the TKD which causes the ligand to dock and activate the receptor causing activation without dimerization (Kiyoi et al, 1998; Hayakawa et al, 2000; Kiyoi et al, 2002; Zheng et al, 2002) This continuous activation causes proliferation and blocks myeloid differentiation of early haematopoietic cells in mice (Kiyoi et al, 1998; Hayakawa et al, 2000; Kiyoi et al, 2002; Zheng et al, 2002). In other murine studies, FLT3 ITDs altered the myeloproliferative phenotype but did not cause a clear acute leukemic state (Kelly et al, 2002a). It is thought that FLT3 mutations are one of two possible synergistic causes of leukemias. Although FLT3 mutations alter differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, there is significant intersection of intracellular pathways that might cause a single FLT3 mutation to disrupt multiple pathways (Kiyoi et al, 1998; Hayakawa et al, 2000; Mizuki et al, 2000; Zheng et al, 2002; Kelly et al, 2002b). Based on Knudson's `two hit' theory (cancers are caused by at least two mutations), FLT3 inhibition therapy may only partially treat a haematopoietic malignancy (Knudson et al, 1975). In addition to continuous signalling, the components involved in the signal cascades themselves are altered with a FLT3 ITD (Mizuki et al, 2000). Instead of eliciting a weak phosphorylation of STAT5 and lack of subsequent DNA binding, mutated FLT3 ITD does the opposite (Mizuki et al, 2000). Additionally, using siRNA, it was demonstrated that silencing FLT3 results in RAD51 downregualtion in FLT3-ITD cells but not in the WT cells (Seedhouse et al, 2006). Furthermore, cells with FLT3 ITDs display decreased expression profiles of PU.1 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP!), two proteins involved in regulation of haematopoietic cell differentiation and proliferation (Mizuki et al, 2002). The FLT3-ITD mutation was also found to suppress SHP-1, and CXCR-4 expression was significantly higher in FLT3-ITD AML than in wildtype FLT3 AML (Chen et al, 2005; Rombouts et al, 2004). Also, a particular FLT3L-Y591 duplication signalling in AML enables accumulation of B-cell
ST! ! !

lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and maintains a downstream block of p53 pathway apoptosis (Irish et al, 2007). Furthermore, FLT3-ITD up-regulates myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), a survival factor for hematopoiesis expressed by hematopoietic stem cells (Yoshimoto et al, 2009). Myeloid cell leukemia-1 is expressed at its highest in response to FLT3 signalling, however when mutated, FLT3-ITD results in even higher MCL-1 expression by interfering with its signal transducer and STAT5-docking domains in AML cell lines, resulting in prolonged cell survival and reduced apoptosis (Yoshimoto et al, 2009). When tyrosine kinase inhibitors were introduced or STAT5 activation blocked, MCL-1 production decreased and apoptosis commenced (Yoshimoto et al, 2009). Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutations in AML patients were found to correlate with FLT3ITD, with a favourable outcome in AML cases that did not have the FLT3-ITD in addition to the NPM1 mutation (Luo et al, 2010). FLT3-ITD and point mutations in the kinase domain, as well as mutation in NPM1 are the most common abnormalities in adult AML (Krstovski et al, 2009). Overall, AML patients with FLT3-ITDs make up 5-15% of paediatric and 25-35% of adult cases with mutations in the activating regions being the most frequent mutations (Meshinchi et al, 2001; Iwai et al, 1999; Kondo et al, 1999; Grundler et al, 2005). Clinically, ITDs are associated with an increase in white blood cells, high blast cell counts, and poor survival rates (Schnittger et al, 2002; Iwai et al, 1999; Kondo et al, 1999). A specific ITD mutation in the activation loop (Y842C) of AML patients causes cell proliferation and survival by playing a role in mediating FLT3 conformations (Kindler et al, 2005). In general, intracellular signals mediated by WT FLT3 are involved with cell differentiation and survival, whereas signalling via FLT-ITD results in enhanced cell growth (Masson et al, 2009). Other mutations consist of a missense point mutation in exon 20 in the TKD. This type of mutation occurs in 5-10% of AML cases, 2-5% of MDS and 1-3% of ALL cases (Thiede et al, 2002; Yamamoto et al, 2001; Abu-Duhier et al, 2001). The most common mutation changes an aspartic acid to tyrosine (GAT!TAT) D835Y and maintains the reading frame (Thiede et al, 2002; Yamamoto et al, 2001; Abu-Duhier et al, 2001). Like ITD mutations, TKD mutations cause receptor phosphorylation and cell growth without stimulation by FLT3L. These TKD mutations are also seen in other RTK3 family members like KIT which has about 80% similarity to the FLT3 TKD (Yamamoto et al, 2001; Spiekermann et al, 2002). Although currently unknown, TKD mutations possibly alter the level of tyrosine kinase activity depending on which
S)! ! !

amino acid is substituted (Kiyoi et al, 2002; Morley et al, 1999; Moriyama et al, 1996). Unfortunately, since TKD mutations occur less frequently, large scale studies are difficult to conduct and like the FLT3 ITD, studies often start after a diagnosis of leukemia and post initial treatment. However, it is noted that FLT3 with TKD mutations are often overexpressed and patients often have a reduction in overall survival (Thiede et al, 2002; Libura et al, 2003). Much less common mutations also occur in and around codon 835, such as deletions with additional codon alterations while maintaining the reading frame (Thiede et al, 2002; Yamamoto et al, 2001; Spiekermann et al, 2002). Most haematopoietic malignancies only have one mutation. It is rare, but possible, to have two mutations at once (Thiede et al, 2002; Meshinchi et al, 2003). The TKD and ITD mutations together, are the greatest cause of genetically modified AML as evidenced by the 25-45% of AML cases with either mutation (Meshinchi et al, 2003). However, studies that indicate the aforementioned effects in relation to AML and ALL patients are not as accurate as studies that are done with consistent patient treatment and analysis.

Clinical significance of FLT3 and the use of inhibitors Although treatment plans are based on level of risk (very low-very high), leukemia patients with similar characteristics and risks often experience different side effects during chemotherapy. Further knowledge of the role that various types of ITDs and TKD mutations play in leukemia may provide greater insight into risk characterization. In recent years, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors seem to be a promising area of treatment for many malignancies. Since FLT3 is involved in many leukemias, the receptor and its downstream molecules are an attractive target for inhibitors. Cephalon makes two FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors; CEP-701 and CEP-5214, each derived from indolocarbazole, that inhibits both wildtype and mutant FLT3. Recently, CEP-701 was found to be toxic to leukemia blasts, to increase survival rate in mice, and has shown some inhibition against KIT, PDGFR, and FMS (Levis et al, 2001). Sugen Life Sciences has also developed several inhibitors such as SU5416, SU5614 and SU11248 blocking FLT3 along with KIT, PDGFR and VEGFR (O'Farrell et al, 2003; Yee et al, 2002; Foran et al, 2002). Millennium Sciences produced MLN518, a piperarazinyl quinazoline that inhibits growth of FLT3-ITD transformed cells along with
S,! ! !

PDGFR and KIT (Kelly et al, 2002c). Novartis Canada has made PKC412, a benzoylstaurosporine, to inhibit VEGF and both wildtype and mutant FLT3 (Armstrong et al, 2002;Weisberg et al, 2002). In 2004, a bi-aryl urea BAY 43-9006 inhibitor of v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (RAF-1), a common downstream target of FLT3, also demonstrated FLT3 inhibition along with inhibition of other RTK3 family members (Wilhelm et al, 2004). Additionally, general tyrosine kinase inhibitors like PKC412, are able to inhibit mutated FLT3, as seen with evidence of inhibition of Y842C ITD mutated FLT3 in AML patients (Grundler et al, 2005). All of these FLT3 inhibitors show mixed success and are not widely in clinical use, but seem extremely promising, especially in treatment of aggressive leukemias caused by FLT3 mutations that could otherwise be lethal.

Previous attempts to express and purify FLT3L Lyman et al. (1993b) was the first group to clone the ligand for the FLT3 receptor from a murine T-cell line (P7B-0.3A4). The cDNA clone of the ligand obtained from an expression library was isolated and when transfected into cells, was able to bind to soluble FLT3 causing the proliferation of murine and human bone marrow cells and murine fetal liver cells that were enriched with hematopoietic stem cells and uncommitted progentior cells (Lyman et al, 1993b). PCR was used to amplify the extracellular coding domain of FLT3L between the end of the signal peptide and the start of the transmembrane segment (Lyman et al, 1993b). A FLAG sequence was added to the N-terminus of the ligand, with a termination codon placed after Gln189 before beginning the transmembrane region (Lyman et al, 1993b). The DNA fragment was then ligated into the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis (K. lactis) for secretion of the ligand into the yeast medium (Lyman et al, 1993). The FLAG-flt3l was purified via affinity chromatography from the yeast supernatant for use in subsequent activity assays. Murine fetal liver cells (AA4.1+, Sca-1+, Linlow) with detectable levels of FLT3 were cultured in either 100 ng/ml IL-7 and 250 ng/ml FLT3L or 1 ug/ml steel factor (SLF) with 250 ng/ml FLT3L (Lyman et al, 1993b). Based on a [3H] thymidine incorporation assay after 5 days incubation, the overall mitotic response of the cells with FLT3L alone was 8x that of cells with no factor added (Lyman et al, 1993b). With IL-7 added in conjunction with FLT3L, the proliferative response was two times greater than IL-7 alone, which had no response at all (Lyman et al, 1993b). The
SX! ! !

combination of SLF and FLT3L produced a proliferative response 3x that of SLF alone which had a response of 14x that of cells with no factor added (Lyman et al, 1993b). Thus, it was concluded that although FLT3L does have significant activity alone, it works synergistically with other factors such as SLF and IL-7 to produce an even greater hematopoietic cell response (Lyman et al, 1993b). In 2005, Zhang et al. cloned FLT3L in the Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) system and were able to get a yield of 30 mg/L of recombinant FLT3L with a purity of 95% utilizing dialysis, filtration and anion-exchange steps. A synthetic DNA fragment was constructed based on P. pastoris biased codon usage encoding soluble human FLT3L, supernatant was analysed for expression of FLT3L and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0 with a molecular weight cut off of 12kDa and filtered through a 0.45um filter (Zhang, 2005). After application to an anionexchange column, bound protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient (Zhang, 2005). Fifty millilitre fractions were concentrated to 5mL using a freeze drier and the concentrate was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (Zhang, 2005). Both a low (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) fraction was isolated and the low weight fraction was collected and analysed by reverse phase HPLC to be the recombinant FLT3L (Zhang, 2005). The purified protein was treated with 1mU Endo H and subsequently analysed by western blotting (Zhang, 2005). The low molecular weight fraction appeared to be FLT3L at a molecular weight of 21kDa while the higher weight fraction of 34kDa also appeared to be a different form of FLT3L with a different set of carbohydrate components (Zhang, 2005). After Endoglycosidase H was used to remove N-linked glycosylation, both the HMW and LMW bands seen in the Western blot were at a lower molecular weight, however the weight was still higher than seen in recombinant FLT3L produced in E.coli, indicating that other post-translational modifications had occurred (Zhang, 2005). The pI of the 21kDa recombinant FLT3L was determined to be between 3.12 4.72 (Zhang, 2005). Cell activity was measured by using the 21kDa FLT3L on nucleated bone marrow cells derived from mice. GM-CSF (100 ng/ml) was used in conjunction with several concentrations of FLT3L (0-100 ng/ml) (Zhang, 2005). Alone, FLT3L showed a weak response, but with the addition of GM-CSF, and increasing concentrations of FLT3L, enhanced cell expansion was seen in a dose-dependant manner (Zhang, 2005).

In 2010, Zhao et al. (2010) attempted to express, purify and characterize FLT3L in E.coli. The were able to express the extracellular domain of recombinant human FLT3L as a thioredoxin (Trx) fusion protein (Zhao et al, 2010). The protein however, was insoluble and expressed only in inclusion bodies that were refolded and purified using dialysis and affinity chromatography (Zhao et al, 2010). They subsequently tested the recombinant FLT3L on murine bone marrow nucleated cells to obtain a proliferation assay and colony forming assay (Zhao et al, 2010). The original cloning vector was pET32a(+) and expression was done in E. coli BL21 (Zhao et al, 2010). Purification was completed using the ProBondTM Purification System (Invitrogen) while refolding and dialysis of the purified protein was done simultaneously in the dialysis bag (Zhao et al, 2010). Bone marrow cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and the purified Trx-FLT3L or Trx alone was added to the cell media at a concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ng/mL (Zhao et al, 2010). Cells were cultured for one week. A MTT colorimetry and colony-forming assay was done (Zhao et al, 2010). Results indicate that Trx-FLT3L was dramatically effective past 10 ng/mL compared to the Trx controls. At 1 ug/mL about 42 colonies were seen as opposed to 9 in the Trx control (Zhao et al, 2010). As demonstrated by the above attempts to express and purity a soluble form of FLT3L, it is challenging to produce this cytokine (Table 1 & 2). Since FLT3L is a transmembrane protein with the cytosolic and transmembrane portions unnecessary for function, when expressing the protein it is useful to only express the extracellular portion of the protein which is both soluble and functional (Lyman et al, 1998). It seems the best species to produce the ligand, is yeast. When attempting to express FLT3L in E.coli, the protein is always found in inclusion bodies and needs to be denatured and refolded to produce the finished product. Not only is this time consuming and difficult to accomplish, but often when this occurs, proteins are misfolded and their original functionality is lost (Cox & Nelson, 2008). Secondly, unlike E.coli, yeast is able to glycosylate the ligand and perform other post-translational modifications that may be necessary for its function both in vitro and in vivo (New England Biolabs, 2011). Natively, FLT3L is heavily glycosylated, adding as much as 13kDa, as seen in the work of Zhang et al. (Zhang et al, 2005). Also, FLT3L can be glycosylated to varying degrees, however the literature currently does not indicate the exact amount of N and O linked glycosylation that occurs in each species. Furthermore, in all expression papers, dialysis was used to remove any contaminants and to adjust the pH when working with yeast strains that may produce acidic by-products (Lyman et al,

One problem with expressing in yeast such as K. lactis, is the very low pH of the media which may interfere with protein purification when using such tags as histidine, as it would become a weak acid (around pH 4) resulting in it being protonated and unble to bind metal from affinity chromatography columns, thus preventing purification of the protein (Cox & Nelson, 2008). To counter this, dialysis must be done to increase the pH to optimal HIS-tag binding conditions (pH 7). As seen in the cases above, activity of recombinant human and mouse FLT3L has been shown to be effective in proliferating nucleated mouse bone marrow cells at as low a concentration as 10 ng/mL, making the ligand extremely potent (Zhang et al, 2005). Additionally, it is able to function both on its own and synergistically with other factors such as SLF, IL-7 and GM-CSF with a proliferative response occurring in about 3-7days (Lyman et al, 1993a).

Activity in other cell lines Since FLT3 is clinically important in AML cases, FLT3L has been tested with various AML cell lines. Drexler H. et al. (1999) conducted a comprehensive activity assay on many AML cell lines using [3H]-thymidine incorporation. The strongest responses for cell proliferation were seen in the MUTZ-2 and OCI-AML5 cell lines (Drexler et al, 1999). Co-stimulation of primary AML cell lines was seen with FLT3L in addition to G-SCF, GM-SCF, IL-3, M-CSF, PIXY-321 and SCF, but not EPO (Drexler et al, 1999). Furthermore, IL-4 was found to inhibit the proliferative signal of FLT3L. Both OCI-AML5 and MUTZ-2 cell lines showed increased proliferation when exposed to 50, 100, and 200ng/mL of FLT3L with markedly increased responses when combined with other growth factors such as M-CSF (Drexler et al, 1999). Additionally, OCI-AML5 cells, an AML cell line, proliferates in part, due to the activation of both ERK and p38 MAPK pathways in response to G-CSF and FLT3L (Srinivasa & Doshi, 2002). Teleshova et al. (2004) administered human FLT3L in vivo to macaques to determine the extent of mobilization of dendritic cells (DC). After treatment with FLT3L (100 ug/kg/day) for 5-7 days, DC's were mobilized and the DC frequency continued to escalate even past the seventh day of treatment (Teleshova et al, 2004). Dendritic cells analyzed within the lineage-human leukocyte antigen-DR+ cells including CD11c-CD123+ plasmacytoid DC's, CD11c+CD123myeloid and CD11c-CD123-cells (Teleshova et al, 2004). There have since been many experiments done to determine the effectiveness of FLT3L on various blood cell lines, however FLT3L has never been tested on RAW264.7 cells, a mouse leukaemic monocyte macrophage cell line. If FLT3L activates RAW264.7 cells their morphology would appear to be flattened, spread out and highly vacuolated which are all characteristics of a dendritic cell phenotype (Haak-Frendscho et al, 1990).

RATIONALE Cell signalling controls each function within the cell including differentiation, growth, proliferation and apoptosis. Receptors on the surface of cells interact with their ligands to illicit an intracellular response which controls the activity of the cell (Cox & Nelson, 2008). Ligandreceptor complexes such as FLT3-FLT3L are of great importance because they control the cell life cycle. When these receptors become mutated, they often result in uncontrolled cell signalling and a diagnosis of cancer (Cox & Nelson, 2008). In the case of the FLT3 receptor complex, mutated FLT3 contributes to continuous proliferation and a decrease in apoptosis of blood cells leading to a leukemic condition (Lyman et al, 1994b). Techniques such as LARC can be used in combination with mass spectrometry to provide more insight into the intramolecular signal sequence triggered by FLT3L in order to fully understand the cause of uncontrolled cell signalling leading to cancer (Jankowski et al, 2008). In order to complete multiple trials of LARC experiments, a source of the active form of the desired ligand must be obtained. The purpose of this thesis was to clone, express and purify a truncated, soluble form of FLT3L for use in subsequent LARC experiments to determine if there are any binding partners to FLT3L in blood and human myeloid leukemia models.

Experimental Procedures Cloning of FLT3L in E.coli Murine FLT3L cDNA in E.coli DH10B was purchased from ATCC in lyophilized form and resuspended in LB media containing 50mg/mL ampicillin (amp). E.coli was grown overnight at 37°C with shaking at 250rpm. Plasmid mini-preparation was preformed as per QIAprep kit instructions to purify the pDC406 construct containing FLT3L cDNA. Purified pDC406 (1.2ug) was digested by EcoRI or BamHI (BamHI 20U, 1x NEBuffer 3 (50 mM TrisHCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Dithiothreitol, pH 7.9 ), 1.2ug pDC406) (EcoRI 20U, 1x NEBuffer EcoRI (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.025 % Triton X-100, pH 7.5), 1.2ug pDC406) overnight at 37°C to determine whether the correct size fragments of 7.5, 6.4, 3.4, 1.1, and 1.1 kb, were produced.

PCR and primer design Primers were designed to amplify the extracellular domain of FLT3L starting from just after the native signal sequence at T18 and ending before the transmembrane region at R188. Total amplified FLT3L region was 161 amino acids. Two primer sets were made, each with the forward primer containing a XhoI site next to a Kex region before the FLT3L cDNA region. The reverse primers contained a stop codon just before a EcoRI site, with one having a 10HIS tag just before the stop codon.

Digestion, Ligation and Transformation Predicted size of the 10HIS product was 541kb and the non-tagged product was 511kb. The PCR products, HIS-FLT3L and FLT3L, were cleaned as directed by QIAquick gel extraction kit and digested overnight at 37°C (XhoI 20U, EcoRI 20U, 1x NEBuffer 4 (20 mM Tris-acetate, 50 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM Magnesium Acetate, 1 mM Dithiothreitol, pH 7.9), 100 ug/ml BSA, 0.63 ug 10HIS-FLT3L DNA, or 0.72 ug FLT3L DNA). Approximately 1 ug pKLAC2 was also digested as previously described. Digested HIS-FLT3L and FLT3L pcr products were each ligated to the digested pKLAC2 plasmid (7.5 U T4 ligase, 1xDNA ligase buffer (400 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM MgCl2, 100 mM DTT, 5 mM ATP, pH 7.8), nuclease-free water, 100 ng pKLAC2, 50 ng FLT3L or 45 ng HISFLT3L) for 2hrs at room temperature. Approximately 3 uL of the 10 uL ligation reactions were used in the transformation of competent E.coli DH5! cells by heat shock method described previously (Hanahan, 1983) and grown on LB agar plates containing 50 mg/mL amp. Several positive colonies of DH5! cells containing either HIS-FLT3LpKLAC2 or FLT3LpKLAC2 were selected and grown overnight in LB media containing 50 mg/mL ampicillin (amp). After completing plasmid mini-prep on the selected colonies, they were screened further for positive ligation of FLT3L DNA by double digesting overnight with both XhoI and EcoRI as previously described to determine presence of insert (511kb FLT3L or 541kb HIS-FLT3L). In addition, positive transformants were sent to MaRS (Toronto, ON) to be sequenced to confirm correct frame and sequence. Primers used for sequencing were adapted from the K. lactis Expression kit (NEB) and ordered from IDT.

growth on Yeast Carbon Base (YCB) agar plates (30 mM Tris-HCl, 11.7 mg/mL YCB medium powder, 20 mg/mL Bacteriological agar) containing 5 mM acetamide at 30°C for 2 days. Several colonies were picked and grown in YPGal medium (10 mg/mL yeast extract, 20mg/mL Bacteriological peptone, 40% galactose) for 3 days at 30°C with shaking (250 rpm) to a final cell density of >30 OD600 units/ml. Properly integrated cells were confirmed by whole cell PCR as described by the NEB K. lactis protein expression kit using Integration primers 1 and 2, and analyzed on a 1% agarose gel to reveal a 2.4 kb product if integration was complete.

Western Dot-blot A western dot-blot was done to determine whether the various strains were expressing FLT3L or HIS-FLT3L and also to determine the relative amount each was expressing. Approximately 2 uL of supernatant was applied to a piece of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane wet with 100% methanol and left to dry. The PVDF was then soaked in 100% methanol, rinsed with water and blocked for 30 mins at room temperature with 5% milk solution in PBST with 1% donkey serum. It was then washed once with TBST and the primary antibody, anti-murine FLT3L (R&D systems), was applied (1:1000, 0.2 ug/mL) for 30 min room temperature. After three 5min washes with TBST, the secondary antibody, donkey anti-goat HRP, was applied (1:10,000, 0.026ug/mL) for 30mins at room temperature then washed 3x 5 min. The PVDF membrane was developed using ECL western blot solution (100mM Tris pH 8.8, 250 mM Luminol, 2 mM IPBA) (Haan & Iris, 2007). A strain of K. lactis that did not contain the insert was used as a control for all experiments.

Purification of HIS-FLT3L Large batches of YPGal media were inoculated with 1 mL/100 mL overnight starter culture and grown for 3 days at 30°C, 250rpm to a final cell density of >30 OD600 units/ml . Media was then centrifuged (8000 rpm, 10 min) and the pelleted cells and supernatant collected.

Cells Cell pellets were dried and resuspended in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing protease cocktail inhibitor solution (5 mM PMSF, 5 mM SEBSF and 5 mM EDTA). Cells were then homoginized in a French® Press (Thermo Spectronic). Homogenate was centrifuged for 60 min at 45000 x g. The resulting supernatant and pellets were dried in a centrivap concentrator (Labconco) overnight and subjected to a discontinuous SDS-PAGE (4% stacking, 9% separating). About 40 uL of supernatant or pellet was added to 10 uL 10x SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated before being eletrophoresced. After transferring onto PVDF membrane, western blot was analysis was done as previously described using anti-murine FLT3L primary antibody (R&D Systems).

Supernatant Supernatant of the three strains of K. lactis (control, HIS-FLT3L, FLT3L strains) were dialyzed for 2 days against (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0) (6 L, 7 buffer changes in total) to a final pH of 7.7-8.0. Dialysed HIS-FLT3L supernatant was loaded onto a Qiagen Ni-NTA Superflow
column and the flowthrough collected. The column was washed with 4mL wash buffer (50mM

NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and eluted with 2mL elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) an additional elution step of 2M imidazole was performed to remove all traces of protein from the column. All collected fractions, starting materials, and control supernatants were dried in a centrivap concentrator from 1.5 mL to a final volume of 400 uL to be used for discontinuous SDS-PAGE (4% stacking, 9% separating). Approximately 40 uL of sample was added to 10 uL 10x SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated before being electrophoresced. After transferring proteins from the gels to a PVDF membrane, western blot analysis was done as previously described with anti-murine FLT3L primary antibody (R&D Systems). The remaining HIS-FLT3L primary elution was dried completely in the centrivap concentrator and frozen at -80°C until needed. Dried HIS-FLT3L was washed with ethanol and air dried before being resuspended in 1mL sterilized HPLC grade water for use in RAW264.7 cell activity assays. Bradford assays were done on the cell pellet, pellet and

Raw 264.7 cell culture and staining RAW 264.7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 6-well plates on 2.5cm glass cover slips at 37°C to 40% confluence. Cells were washed 3 x 5min with PBS and fixed in PBS + 4% para-formaldehyde for 20mins rocking at room temperature. Fixing was terminated by addition of PBS + 5% glycine at room temperature for 5 min and washed once more 3 x 5min with PBS. Cell staining was done with Alexa Fluor 488® phalloidin (Invitrogen) using 0.2 units/mL for 20-30 min in the dark at room temperature.

Confirmation of FLT3 receptor in RAW264.7 cells RAW264.7 cells were grown as previously described then collected before adding PBS containing protease cocktail inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich), 4-(2-Aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell solution was then lysed with a French® Press (Thermo Spectronic) before adding 2x SDS sample buffer and being boiled for 10min. Approximately 40 uL of RAW264.7 cell lysates were run on a 9% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane wet with 100% methanol. The PVDF was blocked for 30mins at room temperature with 5% milk solution in PBST with 1% goat serum. It was then washed once with TBST and the primary antibody (anti-FLT3 mouse, rabbit polyclonal IgG) was applied (1:1000) for 30 min room temperature. After three 5 min washes with TBST, the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit HRP, was applied (1:10,000) for 30 min at room temperature then washed 3 x 5min. The PVDF membrane was developed using ECL Western blot solution (100 mM Tris pH 8.8, 250 mM Luminol, 2 mM IPBA) (Haan & Iris, 2007).

RESULTS Cloning of HIS-FLT3LpKLAC2 and FLT3LpKLAC2 A truncated version of FLT3L without the native signal sequence, transmembrane, and cytosolic regions, was amplified by PCR from a full length sequence in order to allow for greater protein solubility when using the K.lactis expression system. Restriction digest of the purified plasmid from E.coli DH10B was confirmed to be pDC406 containing full length murine FLT3L insert (Figure 6). As predicted, PCR of the truncated FLT3L and HIS-FLT3L displayed a band at approximately 505 kb and 535 kb respectively (Figure 7). The truncated fragments were successfully ligated into pKLAC2 plasmid within the Lac4 yeast promoter (Figure 8, 9). The new constructs were homologously integrated with the K. lactis genome and whole cell PCR of 8 strains (4 containing HIS-FLT3LpKLAC2, 4 with FLT3LpKLAC2), was able to amplify a 2.4kb product indicating successful integration of the construct DNA (Figure 10).

Expression and Purification of HIS-FLT3L The Western dot-blot determined that strain all positive strains of K. lactis were expressing HIS-FLT3L or FLT3L (Figure 11). Dialysis of the yeast supernatant brought the pH from 4.67 to 7.5 - 8. The Ni-affinity chromatography fractions of HIS-FLT3L were analyzed with SDS-PAGE, Western blot and mass spectrometry to determine the presence of FLT3L. The coommassie stained 9% SDS-PAGE gels consistently showed a band around 50 kDa that was not clearly seen in the crude supernatant fractions (Figures 12, 14 & 16). Additionally, the elution fraction showed two other bands at 250 kDa and 75 kDa (Figures 12, 14 & 16). Western blot analysis showed no reaction with the wash fraction, but a dark smear consistently appeared in the elution fraction (Figures 13, 15 &17). Total concentration of protein in a 2 mL elution volume (150 mL dialysed supernatant starting volume) was 0.1 mg/mL as determined by Bradford assay (Table 3). Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the 250, 75 and 50 kDa bands in the elution corresponded to FLT3L, however the 50 kDa band seen in the wash did not contain FLT3L (Figure 14, 18-21, Table 4).

Crude supernatant from 3 different HIS-FLT3LpKLAC2 strains, FLT3LpKLAC2 strains, and 2 control strains of K. lactis were spotted on PVDF (2 µL crude supernatant from 50 mL total culture) and a Western was performed using an anti-FLT3L murine monoclonal antibody (R&D systems).

HIS-FLT3L Activity Assays A Western blot analysis of RAW254.7 cell lysates was done to determine if the RAW cells expressed the FLT3 receptor. The blot showed two bands around 125 and 145 kDa (Figure 22) which is consistent with previous western blot analysis of murine FLT3. All RAW264.7 cells exposed to HIS-FLT3L (3.3, 6.6, 13.2, or 16.5ug) (final concentrations of 1.1 ug/mL, 2.2 ug/mL, 4.4 ug/mL or 5.5 ug/mL) had increased vacuole size and were more spread out compared to the controls (Figure 23).

DISCUSSION Cloning of FLT3L as well as the integration of HIS-FLT3LpKLAC2 and FLT3LpKLAC2 plasmids into K. lactis was successful. The first construct consisted of the pKLAC2 plasmid with FLT3L cDNA inserted just after a XhoI and Kex region, ending with a EcoRI site (Figure 9). The HIS-FLT3L cDNA was similarly ligated into pKLAC2, but with a 10x HIS tag at the C-terminus before the EcoRI site (Figure 9). Single copy homologous integration of the linearized expression cassette into the K. lactis genome displayed a 2.4 kb product after being subjected to whole cell PCR with primers designed to target the insert site within the LAC4 yeast promoter (Figure 10). Expression of HIS-FLT3L and secretion of the protein into the yeast medium was accomplished over three days of incubation at 30°C in YPGal medium containing 5 mM acetamide. The acetamide gene (amdS) found in the pKLAC2 plasmid allows for the selection of yeast with an integrated expression cassette by permitting growth in nitrogen-free media (New England Biolabs, 2011). Only cells containing amdS are able to break down acetamide to ammonia to use as a nitrogen source (New England Biolabs, 2011). An advantage of this selection method, is that cells which contain multiple copies of the expression cassette are able to better utilize acetamide, thereby growing faster than those with only singlecopy integrants, ultimately resulting in greater protein secretion (New England Biolabs, 2011). Finally, a dot-blot was done with anti-murine FLT3L antibody (R&D Systems) to ensure that each strain was expressing detectable amounts of FLT3L or HIS-FLT3L (Figure 14).

Purification of HIS-FLT3L Since the pH of the medium was determined to be around 4-5, it was deemed necessary to dialyse the supernatant containing HIS-FLT3L against the binding buffer in order to bring the pH to a suitable 7-8 and optimize binding conditions of the HIS-tag to the Ni-NTA column (Cox & Nelson, 2008). Previous trials of Ni-affinity purification with pH 4-5 supernatant did not result in much protein binding to the column and the elution yield of purified protein was very low compared to purification steps done at pH 7-8. The crude supernatant contained very small amounts of total protein (1 mg/mL) so in order for bands to show on a SDS-PAGE stained with coomassie, all samples were first concentrated before being applied to the gel. However, the
$+! ! !

small amount of protein in the supernatant made purification easier as it decreased the number of available contaminants during Ni-affinity chromatography steps. There was a band consistently seen on the SDS-PAGE gels at around 50-75 kDa in both the wash and elution chromatography fractions (Figures 12, 14 & 16). Additionally, the elution fraction showed a smeared band on the western blot analysis of the corresponding SDS-PAGE gels (Figures 13, 15 & 17).The wash band at 75 kDa, and several bands from the elution (250,75, 50 kDa) were cut and digested with trypsin for analysis by MS (Figures 14, 18-21, Table 4). All elution bands were found to contain murine FLT3L, however the 75 kDa wash band cut from the SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 14) did not contain any FLT3L, suggesting the band seen on the SDSPAGE wash fraction may be a contaminant that was weakly bound to the column or HIS-FLT3L which was ultimately eluted with the 20 mM imidazole wash buffer. The smeared elution band seen in the western blots along with the MS data showing FLT3L at 250, 75 and 50 kDa, may suggest two things. Firstly, FLT3L may be glycosylated to varying degrees adding different weights to the protein making it much higher than expected, as seen with Zhang et al. (2005), adding as much as 13 kDa to the overall molecular weight. Secondly, although the protein was boiled in SDS buffer before being analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blot, the protein may be aggregating and dimerizing thereby affecting the migration of the protein on an SDS-PAGE resulting in a smeared appearance. Total protein in the 2 mL elution (150 mL dialysed starting material) was determined to be 0.2 mg (0.1 mg/mL) by Bradford assay.

RAW 264.7 Activity Assays Elution fractions were pooled together, dried, and kept at -80°C for storage. When needed, purified HIS-FLT3L was resuspended in sterilized water and used for RAW264.7 activity assays. RAW264.7 cell lysates were analysed with a western blot with anti-murine FLT3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc). Two bands at around 120 and 145 kDa were seen which correspond to the size of FLT3 seen in murine cells (Figure 22). Cells were exposed to approximately 3.3, 6.6, 13.2, or 16.5 ug of FLT3L for 24 hours at 37°C. Activity of RAW264.7 cells was seen with all concentrations of FLT3L used. Cells appear to contain large vacuoles, are spread out, and have large protrusions extending from the cells
$"! ! !

(Figure 23a). The controls were drastically different from those cells exposed to FLT3L. Control cells exposed to control yeast supernatant were small in size, had less protrusions, and small vacuoles (Figure 23b). Previous data suggests RAW264.7 cells develop a dendritic appearance and become flattened, spread out, and have large vacuoles when activated (Haak-Frendscho et al, 1990). This suggests that the RAW264.7 cells that were administered FLT3L became activated within 24 hours of exposure. These activated cells are then able to perform as mature macrophages.

Future implications of results This is the first paper to date, where the soluble portion of FLT3L was produced in the K. lactis system using a histadine tag for Ni-affinity chromatography purification. The smeared appearance of the elution band on the Western blots has not been seen in previous FLT3L expression papers. This may provide a unique insight as to the degree of glycosylation and other post-translational modifications to FLT3L. It was originally suggested by Zhang et al. (2005) that there may be other post-translational modifications besides the currently described N-linked glycosylation. Similarly, different sizes of FLT3L were seen on SDS-PAGE and Western blot most likely indicating several different isoforms with varying degrees of glycosylation. However, it is highly unusual that the SDS-PAGE combined with MS analysis showed FLT3L with a weight of up to 250 kDa, suggesting aggregation or dimerization of the ligand. Additionally, FLT3L has never been tested on RAW264.7 macrophage cells. We show here that FLT3L is able to change the morphology of RAW264.7 cells, suggesting that it activates this cell type. Moreover, the ability of FLT3L to activate macrophages in such a short period of time has never before been documented. Typically, FLT3L is often added to a cocktail of colony stimulating factors to produce a response in 3-7 days (Lyman et al, 1994b). Conversely, we have seen FLT3L alone dramatically change the appearance of RAW264.7 cells within 24 hours causing them to activate in a very short period of time. This finding is important because macrophage cells play a huge role in the phagocytosis of cellular debris and pathogens (Haak-Frendscho et al, 1990). Additionally, macrophage cells are able to stimulate lymphocytes and several immune responses such as the elimination of foreign substances like cancer cells and
$)! ! !

microbes (Haak-Frendscho et al, 1990). As noted earlier, the use of FLT3L to stimulate lymphocytes to eliminate tumor cells, was successful in murine models (Saito et al, 2008). It was also previously noted that antigen-presenting dendritic cell development is also promoted by FLT3 activation, which leads to clonal expansion of dendritic cells in bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and blood serum (Saunders et al, 1996; Maraskovsky et al, 1996; Morse et al, 2000). These findings suggest FLT3L simulation may boost immune response to tumors, therefore evidence presented here that FLT3L alone is able to stimulate RAW macrophages in a short period of time is an important insight. Since RAW264.7 cells are readily available and commonly used in laboratory research, this may prove useful for further research into the way FLT3L functions on macrophage cells and the use of the ligand for cancer immunotherapy. Not only is FLT3L a potential cytokine for use in immunotherapy, but it can also be used in LARC experiments to determine if it has any binding partners in blood. As stated previously, LARC is able to determine what binds to FLT3L and the FLT3-FLT3L receptor complex in live cells to give an accurate depiction of what is happening in cells once the receptor is activated (Jankowski et al, 2008). This knowledge could lead to the discovery of new cancer biomarkers and potential sites for inhibition in cancerous cells. Overall, a protocol for a sustainable source of FLT3L was developed so that the purified product can be used for future LARC experiments to find interactors that might serve as therapeutic agents in human body fluids and cell culture models of myeloid leukemia. !

CONCLUSION A truncated, soluble form of FLT3L was amplified from the full length sequence by PCR and cloned into a genomic integration and expression vector for K. lactis secretion of the 161 amino acid FLT3L then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and mass spectrometry. Western blot analysis showed a smeared band in the elution fraction from Ni-NTA affinity chromatography purification. Western blot and LC-ESI MS/MS showed that FLT3L had varying degrees of glycosylation or other posttranslational modifications, which would make the molecular weight higher than expected. Additionally, FLT3L at such high molecular weights has not been seen before in previous literature, however it has been shown that there may be modifications other than N-linked glycosylation, involved in FLT3L production (Zhang et al, 2005). The novel activity assay done in RAW264.7 cells showed that FLT3L was able to activate the macrophages in approximately 24 hours resulting in large vacuoles and a spread out appearance compared to controls. The purified FLT3 ligand will be utilized for LARC proteinprotein interaction studies to search for interactors in blood that may provide insight into potential avenues for drug development for leukemic conditions.

FUTURE OBJECTIVES Future work with the purified FLT3L ligand will include attaching it to microbeads to use in pull-down LARC protein interaction studies to search for interactors that might serve as therapeutic agents in human body fluids and cell culture models of myeloid leukemia. Other future work could also focus on using endoglycosylation H on the purified FLT3L to determine whether there is a shift in weight from the cleavage of asparagine-linked mannose rich oligosaccharides on the protein. Additional experiments could include RAW264.7 activity assays using a wider range of masses of FLT3L protein to determine what is the minimum concentration that can be used to illicit a response and at which point in time does the dendritic phenotype appear after RAW264.7 cells are exposed to FLT3L. Lastly, a phagocytosis assay could be completed to determine whether the RAW264.7 cells are capable of internalizing microbeads and at what rate the beads are engulfed.
