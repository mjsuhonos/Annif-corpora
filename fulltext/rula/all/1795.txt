Abstract
'Fatigue Damage and Life Assessment of Welded Joints Based on Energy Methods', Faertom Pakandam, Master of Applied Science Thesis in Mechanical Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada, 2009.
The present study intends to evaluate fatigue damage of different welded joints under loading conditions and their response on fatigue lifetime. The main variables influencing the fatigue life of a welded joint are: applied stress amplitude, material properties, geometrical stress concentration effects, and size and location of welding defects. In order to carry out the study, calculations have been performed using the parameters in three energy-based models. Calculations have been carried out separately for each model from the original experimental data obtained from available literature related to each welded joint. The data variables used as a basis for the calculations of the energy-based models for different welded joints include: cyclic stress-strain properties related to the base metal material type of the welded joints, dimensional and geometrical information on the welded joints, and stress versus endurance cycle tables obtained from the tests performed on the welded joints. All the mentioned variables are parameters influencing the fatigue life of a welded joint.

Fatigue damage assessments were performed and discussed based on earlier developed energy damage approaches consisting of: (i) the hysteresis loop based parameter of Masing type material, (ii) the notch stress-intensity based parameter and (iii) the critical plane/energy based parameter. In evaluating fatigue damage of welded joints, these approaches were discussed based on the comparison of energy-lifetime diagrams obtained from each energy model and how readily coefficients/constants are determined and employed in the parameters. In addition, a finite element analysis was performed on selected welded joints to obtain local peak stress values and their location. Numerically obtained stress concentration factor and fatigue notch factor values were also compared with their analytical values.

To assess fatigue damage of welded joints based on various energy models, different sets of experimentally obtained fatigue data performed by different laboratories under uniaxial loading conditions available in literature were chosen. The welded joints used in this study

v

were butt joint, cruciform joint, butt-ground joint, and butt-strap fillet joint. The welded joint base metals included low carbon structural steel, aluminium alloys, and carbon steel.

The energy models were compared for their energy-fatigue life curve slopes and their ability to converge the related nominal stress-life scatter. The energy values calculated based on their models included the effect of variables of cyclic stresses. Important results were concluded for welded joints from the study including: the relation between fatigue notch factor and fatigue strength, the stress-life diagram slope and fatigue resistance, the ability of the energy models to reflect the fatigue notch factor, and merits and disadvantages of each energy model.

Objective and Scope of the Thesis
Welding technology has progressed quickly recently due to the rapid growth of industries and the high demand of practical, economical and reliable joining methods. Today welding is without any doubt the main joining method used in different industries, and if not for this technique, many structures or even whole sectors may not be existent. Considering the fact that in many cases welded joints are exposed to repeated loading, the prevention of structural damage highlights the importance of the study of fatigue in welded joints, which is the cause for numerous failures happening in working conditions. In this regard and in order to reach an optimum reliable welded joint, it is important that appropriate fatigue damage-assessment and life prediction methods are developed for welded joints and utilized by design engineers, to protect welded structures from unwanted fatigue failures.

Although fatigue design of welded joints has usually been based on S-N diagrams, obtained from experimental data from fatigue tests mentioned in the form of nominal stress, there are significant restrictions to this approach, resulting in the development and usage of local approaches. The nominal stress approach cannot reveal the local effect near weld toes on the fatigue strength. Energy based methods which are considered local approaches, consider the local stress and strain for modeling the fatigue process through reflecting on the influence of all important parameters affecting fatigue of welded joints.

The objective of this study is to find a suitable energy based method for assessing the fatigue damage of welded joints. Three energy approaches are applied to different welded joints in terms of material and joint type, in a comparison style, analytical format of study. The comparison is performed for two different joint types of the same material, one joint type (with different weld cap heights), and two different joint types with similar alloys. The advantages and disadvantages of the energy approaches, considering the important evaluation criteria for fatigue damage-assessment, are taken into account for finding the most appropriate energy approach. The evaluation criteria for the energy parameters are convergence ability, curve slope, and how readily coefficients/constants are determined and employed in the parameters.

A finite element analysis is also performed on selected welded joints to verify peak stress locations and to obtain local peak stresses resulting in numerically obtained stress concentration factors and fatigue notch factors for the verification of their analytically obtained values.

CHAPTER ONE
Introduction
1.1 Fatigue strength assessment of welded joints; present state of the art
Today welding is without any doubt the main joining method used in different industries. Welded joints are prone to damage (cracking and deterioration) particularly under external forces. Fatigue of welded components is critica11y important and many catastrophic failures are reported to occur in welded joints subjected to repeated loads. The prevention of progressive structural damage under cyclic loading in welded joints requires an extensive examination of failure mode of welded joints in service loading conditions.

An important fact is that the existence of a welded joint in a structure or member can significantly reduce its fatigue strength, and it is usua1ly found that design stresses in repeatedly loaded structures or components are restricted by the fatigue strength of the welded detaiL Although today fatigue failure of welded joints remains the most widespread type of failure, unfortunately the detection of this problem at the design stage is not complete yet, and some of the factors affecting it are still vague due to the complicated nature of material fatigue. Figure 1.1 compares the fatigue strengths of a plane, a notched, and a welded plate in an empirica11y obtained stress-life diagram.

The fatigue damage process is presented by fracture mechanics in three main stages: 1. Crack initiation, 2. Stage I and stage II crack growth 1, 3. Ultimate fracture. Generally, fatigue in welded joints is caused because of stress concentrations. Vast fluctuations in fatigue strengths in welded joints for different metallic materials are a result of variations in stress concentration intensity due to different weld type design and different loading directions. In addition, a weld includes imperfections such as cracks, pores, cavities and undercuts that initiate fatigue cracks.

Fatigue failures in welded joints happen mostly close to the welds rather than in the base metal far from the weld. Fatigue in welded joints is even more complicated due to the great influence of the procedure on the material because of heating and cooling as well as addition of fi ller weld metal in the fusion procedure to connect the base metals resulting in different inhomogeneous materials and different zones. Finally, residual stresses and deformations resulting from the procedure, affect the fatigue behavior [2]. There are several developed approaches for fatigue analysis of welded joints in the literature. Capability of a fatigue approach is highly dependant upon its affecting parameters in fatigue analysis of welded joints under axial loads.

Fatigue failure in welded joints is a localized procedure and is affected or influenced by loading condition. All local approaches are incomplete and cannot be completely standardized due to many procedures and numerous fatigue cases [3]. The effect of loading type in fatigue design of welded joints is highly pronounced. Weld codes have been developed based on the nominal stress approach, and welded joints subjected to variable amplitude loading conditions are yet to be addressed.

Welded joints are graded according to their shape, weld type, loading type and manufacture quality. Then they are allocated to detail classes representing the design S-N curves based on the results of related fatigue tests. The English designation 'detail class' or 'fatigue class ' (FAT) is more customary. The endurable or permissible nominal stress amplitudes are reduced greatly by high tensile residual stresses caused by welding. Stress relieved welded joints allow higher permissible stress amplitudes depending on the stress ratio [3).

The stable crack propagation stage is consisted of stage I and II crack growth.

1.1.1 The S-N diagram and fatigue strength
The cyclic stress-fatigue life data are obtained as welded components are tested under several cyclic stress levels until failure occurs. The applied stress, plotted versus the number of cycles to failure, is known as the S-N curve. Figure 1.2 schematically shows the graphical presentation of an S-N curve.

Endurance limit

Cycles to failure

N

Figure 1.2 Typical S-N curve [4].

In typical S-N curves, with the increase in number of cycles, the applied stress decreases and the curve flattens out horizontally, and a small decrease in stress results in a large number of cycles that the specimen can resist. For plain ferrous specimens, after about 2-5 million cycles, the curve moves to a parallel position with the horizontal N axis, showing that at a slightly smaller stress, the specimen would have infinite life. This stress is called the endurance limit of the tested material specimen. In welded joints, S-N curves are determined for an endurance range from 105 to 2 x 106 cycles [4].

1.2 Major features in the fatigue assessment process of welded joints
Considering the high quantity of welding performed in the manufacturing sector, it is very important for designers to be able to protect their welded structural designs from unwanted fatigue failures. It is not adequate to design to some random safety factor based on the yield strength of the material and assume that it will prevent fatigue failure. This may be appropriate for other connection types except welded joints; welded design can introduce

3

much more severe stress concentrations; therefore, fatigue failures in such structures are customary. In addition, if a large safety factor is introduced in a welded design, it will result in an over designed and out of proportion structure. The only practical approach to the design of a structure containing welded joints subjected to fatigue loading is to relate the working stresses to fatigue strength data for the specific joint required. In this regard, precise working stresses may not be available or the number of loading repetitions may be unknown [5].

A welded joint is a stress raiser and different types of stress raisers in welded joints result in different local stresses at the joints. The choice of stress depends on the fatigue assessment process used. The stress raiser types and their corresponding effects are presented in table

1.1.

Fatigue of welded joints is very much dependant on local stress/strain components acting at the joint as stress raisers. Fatigue assessment of welded joints should address material microstructure, elastic-plastic response of the material under cyclic deformation, and modes of failure at the joints. There are also other influencing variables resulting in crack initiation where the local stresses and strains are highly concentrated [3].

Table 1.2 introduces all critical parameters affecting fatigue crack initiation in reference to the local approach in fatigue assessment of welded joints.

1.3 Parameters affecting fatigue cracking in welded joints
Weld toes in welded joints are more likely places for crack initiation when subjected to cyclic stresses. The variables influencing the fatigue life of a welded joint consist of [8]:

·

Applied stress amplitude: The magnitudes of the axial or bending stresses at the weld
toe
(&axial

or &bending) greatly affect the fatigue strength of a welded joint.

5

·

Material properties: Strain-controlled fatigue properties ( dt,

~',,

b, c) determine the

resistance to crack nucleation and early crack propagation. The residual stresses in the weldment are limited by the metal's yield strength (S:v); therefore, yield strength of the welded joint base metal is of great significance, specially in non-stress relieved weldments.

·

Geometrical stress concentration effects: The concentration of stress and strain at a
notch/weld toe, increases the effects of the applied stress; therefore, notches reduce the fatigue life, specifica11y the crack nucleation life (Ni) and the early crack growth life

(NPJ ). The effects of the notch are taken into consideration by the fatigue notch factor
(K1), which influences Ni and Np 1·

·

Size and location of welding defects: Weld defects, also known as welding
discontinuities, both at the notch root and elsewhere, magnify the stress-concentrating effects of the critical notch, and can greatly reduce crack initiation life, Ni, short crack growth life, NPJ , and long crack growth life, NP2.

In addition to the above mentioned variables, mean and residual stresses also influence fatigue life of a weld.

CHAPTER TWO Global and local approaches of fatigue damage assessment
Diverse approaches are used for the fatigue analysis of welded joints, differentiated from one another by the factors used for the description of fatigue strengthS or fatigue life N. Strength assessments are named 'global approaches' if they result from external forces or nominal stresses in the critical cross section under constant stress distribution assumption, also named 'nominal stress approach'. Strength assessments are named 'local approaches' if they result from local stress or strain parameters. The local damage that is the stress raiser appears as crack initiation, crack propagation and final fracture. Crack initiation is defined by 'notch stress approach' or 'notch strain approach' based on stresses or strains at the notch root. Crack propagation and final fracture are explained by the 'crack propagation approach' that results from an existing crack already present in the welded joint. Thus, a complete local stress assessment consists of notch stress or strain and the crack propagation approach. An approach that relates the global and local concepts is the 'structural stress approach'. It must be noted that the stress concentration resulting from the weld macro-geometry reflects the considered notch effect of the weld, lowering the S-N curve as an outcome. Generally, fatigue damage approaches are categorized as [2]: · Nominal stress approach; utilizes the nominal stress range, Llanom, established by internal or external loads and the related cross section characteristics. · Structural or hot spot stress approach; utilizes the structural stress range, Llas, near to the welded region, considering the structural discontinuity effect. · Notch stress approach; utilizes the elastic notch-stress range, Llak, considering the notch effect of the weld toe (or weld root). · Notch strain approach; utilizes the local elastic-plastic strain range, Llc:k, explaining the related material damage procedure. · Crack propagation approach; utilizes the J-integral or stress-intensity range, ilK, explaining the crack propagation rate, da/dN. · Notch intensity approach; utilizes the weld notch-stress intensity considering the notch effect of the weld toe.

fatigue strength and life ofweldments [9].

The local approaches evaluate the fatigue strength of welded joints by means of improving components, joint geometry and design based on local stress/strain factors. Fatigue damage based on local stress/strain parameters includes both crack initiation and propagation stages. These local approaches replace the older nominal stress approach, resulting in enhancement in fatigue and lifetime assessment of welded joints.

The present chapter reviews various stress based and strain based approaches and the fracture mechanics approach, employed for fusion-welded joints in the literature. Approaches are discussed for their formulation, parameters involved and applicability to fatigue assessment.

2.1 Nominal stress approach

2.1.1 Principals
The nominal stress approach is a basic method to evaluate fatigue strength and life assessment, based on the applied nominal stress in the critical cross section of the welded joints. The nominal stress-fatigue life (S-N) curve is classified dependant on material, notch, joint attachment specifications and weld quality classes. The nominal stress is defined in the

8

cross section of the base plate. The nom ina I stress approach is essential to design codes and guidelines [3].

In many fields of structural and mechanical engineering such as manufacture of ships, rail vehicles, cranes, bridges and pipes, the nominal stress approach is used as the main fatigue assessment method. For lightweight structures in which damage tolerance is a key assessment, the nominal stress approach is replaced with local stress approaches in coderegulated parts such as unconventional and specific purposes.

2.1.2 Formulation
The nominal stress ( o-na) is related to the number of fatigue cycles, N, through a power law equation [3]:

(2.1)

where ana(EJ is the constant amplitude endurance limit, which is related toNE(NE= 107 cycles for axial loading or NE = 108 cycles for shear stresses and k

2.2 Structural stress or strain approach
The structural stress approach is employed for fatigue strength and life assessment of welded joints at which geometry of the joint results in an increase of stress at the notch root. The structural stress approach evaluates the stress distribution at certain distances away from the weld to minimize the effect of stress concentration in the welded joint. Figure 2.2 schematically shows that the stress distribution decreases as the distance from the weld toe mcreases.

The structural stress approach minimizes the stress concentrations due to the welded joint profile itself. The local stresses, however, are normaJJy greater than nominal stresses due to structural discontinuities. In fatigue assessment, the geometric stress is determined at the critical point of a welded joint (referred to as the ' hot spot' ). The fatigue crack initiation most likely takes place at this point due to the presence of a notch. This approach is used for complicated geometric shapes where there is no clearly defined nominal stress and where the structural discontinuity cannot be compared to any of the classified structural details as shown in figure 2.3 [6].

2.3 Notch stress approach 2.3.1 Principals
The fatigue strength of a structural component depends greatly on stress concentration in the presence of notches. The method is most applicable for welded joints subjected to constant amplitude loading conditions. This approach assumes no considerable plastic deformation induced at the notch root, and that deformation at the notch root is dominantly elastic. The endurable limit of the structural component is slightly reduced according to the elastic stress concentration. The elastic stress concentration factor is determined by geometry and loading of the structural component. It is dependent on the dimensional ratios but not on dimensions or elastic modulus. The fatigue notch factor depends on the notch radius in addition to the parameters controlling the stress concentration factor.

The notch-stress approach theories that are widely employed for fatigue strength assessment of welded joints are: · · · the stress averaging approach originally proposed by Neuber [ 10] the critical distance approach proposed by Peterson [11] the highly stressed volume approach originally proposed by Kuguel [12]

Only small differences were found in the calculated fatigue strength values when comparing these theories [3].

2.3.2 Formulation
Due to the dominancy of the elastic deformation at the notch root, both the elastic notch approach and the nominal stress approach show similar response in fatigue assessment of welded joints. The relationship between the fatigue-effective notch stress amplitude, and the related nominal stress amplitude, ana, is given as:
Clk(eff)a,

(j k( eff)a

= K.f X (jna

(2.9)

where Kf is the fatigue notch factor and the following relations stand:

(Jk( eff)A (J ke.ffa( per)

where terms

and

in the equations, respectively correspond to the permissible

fatigue-effective notch stress amplitude and the safety factor.

The present fatigue-effective notch stress amplitude depends on the fatigue notch factor and the nominal equivalent stress amplitude. The equivalent endurable fatigue-effective notch stress amplitude depends on failure probability, the considered number of cycles until failure, the mean stress and the material condition [3].

2.3.3 Notch stress concentration factor and fatigue notch factor
The elastic notch stress concentration factor, K,, is defined as the ratio of the maximum notch stress, a-k, also known as the local stress ( Oioc), to the nominal stress, CYn ( CYnvm), determined under linear elastic deformation:

(2.12)

The elastic notch stress concentration factor can be either calculated through formulae or obtained from diagrams for standard welded joints (see Appendix D). This factor is required to find the elastic fatigue notch factor, K1. The elastic fatigue notch factor, K1, is similarly defined as the ratio of the fatigue effective notch stress and the nominal stress amplitude (see Equation 2.9). This factor is also obtained from the endurance limit (at NE = 106 to 107 cycles) of the polished specimen without a notch (the stress amplitude the notched specimen (the nominal stress amplitude

It must be noted that if the fatigue notch factor, K1, can be calculated and if material

conditions at the crack site are the same as the parent metal,

K; is preferred to notch stress-

intensity factor, K, , according to Topper's suggestion in 1969 [ 13]. Because fatigue cracks in welded joints initiate at the weld toe (base metal) and propagate through the base metal, encompassing the characteristics of the parent metal, the fatigue notch factor replaces the notch stress-intensity factor, K,.

14

2.3. 4 Effect ofgeometrical weld parameters on fatigue strength of welded joints
The fatigue strength of welded joints depends directly on the elastic notch stressconcentration factor, K,, and the elastic fatigue notch factor, Kr The existence of a welded joint as a stress raiser results in the increase of the notch stress-concentration factor, K,, and the fatigue notch factor, K1: Any increase in K, and K1 is a basis for the decrease in fatigue strength in welded joints. The notch effect is also pronounced with plate thickness, weld toe radius, weld toe undercut depth, weld reinforcement height, weld toe angle or weld angle, notch opening angle and weld reinforcement width. Only the first three parameters have major influence, whereas the reinforcement height has less influence and notch angle and weld width can be neglected [3]. The increase in notch stress-concentration factor K, is evident in the notch stress-concentration diagrams presented in Appendix D.

The notch stress-concentration factor of welded joints decreases with increasing plate thickness. It has been shown that for plate thicknesses in the range of 2-150 mm, the decrease in fatigue strength is more than 60 percent, which is within the acceptable range of welded joint design curves associated with present weld codes [7].

The fatigue notch factor of welded joints is also influenced by weld toe angle or weld angle. Its effect has already been studied for the double-V butt-welds and the cruciform joint with flat fillet welds in tensile and bending loading conditions. The stress concentration factors, for the two main weld joints mentioned, increase as weld angle increases below 60° stating that the weld angle should be reduced as far as possible. In addition, it has been found for fillet and cruciform joints that the increase in weld root face length to base metal thickness ratio results in the increase in the stress concentration factor, concluding that the weld root face length should be reduced by decreasing the base metal thickness in the weld root [3].

Weld toe undercut is a defect that happens at the weld toe with the occurrence of the welding process, shown in figure 2.5. It reduces the fatigue strength of welded joints. The IIW guidance defines this reduction as being dependant on undercut depth, a, and radius, p, and plate thickness, t. The typical undercut depth and notch radius are: 0.05 < a < 1.1 mm, 0.005 < p < 1 mm, respectively [3].

Figure 2.5 Cross sectional schematic model of welded joint with undercut defect [3].

,____. ------

A weld grinding procedure is used for removing the undercut and defects at the weld toe and to decrease the weld toe angle, resulting in an even changeover between the weld metal and base metaL In the case of transverse butt-welded joints, the excess weld metal or weld cap can be removed completely, or local treatment by grinding the weld toes can be performed on the weld edges. In the case of fillet joints, if grinding is to be performed, it must be made sure that weld throat thickness is not decreased, resulting in weld throat failure or as previously mentioned, increase in fatigue notch factor. It must be noted that in order to obtain appropriate improvement in strength through toe grinding, the process must penetrate the base metal surface about 0.5 mm under any visible undercut, also resulting in a slight decrease in the local plate thickness, which leads to a fatigue notch factor decrease [4, 14].

Weld defects such as small, sharp, slag intrusions, are unavoidably present at the weld toe, like undercuts, and act as crack initiation sites, and thus are a significant variable in weld fatigue. Examinations have shown that the average depth of these defects is 0.15 mm and the maximum depth is 0.4 mm. It has also been suggested that high quality welds contain defects up to 0. 1 mm. With respect to the relation between present welding defects and their effect on fatigue life, there are two main views: one suggesting that the fatigue life is dominated by the crack propagation process, and the other different view suggesting that the fatigue strength of welded joints is made up of crack initiation and propagation [ 15].

2.4 Notch strain approach for welded joints
2.4.1 Principals
The stresses and strains at the notch root of the structural component are calculated resulting from the cyclic stress-strain curve and Neuber' s approach. In addition, the effect of microstructure has to be considered due to sharp notches. The notch root strain can also be measured using a strain gauge [3].

Although the combination of the notch strain approach for crack initiation and the crack propagation approach have been applied to welded joints frequently, the extent of agreement with empirical results has not always been satisfactory. The reason for this is that the notchstrain approach was originally designed for medium-cycle fatigue in mild notches in homogeneous material, whereas welded joints are inhomogeneous material with sharp notches with high-cycle fatigue range application.

Application of the variants of the notch strain approach is only likely if the micro-structural notch support effect is considered. Notch stresses and strains can either be introduced without accounting for this effect, using the notch stress concentration factor, K,, or by considering its effect, using the fatigue notch factor, K1- The result of combining the notch strain and crack propagation approaches is shown in the schematic S-N curve in figure 2.6. Prevailing elastic conditions are considered in the high-cycle fatigue range.

Different types of welded joints with crack initiation sites have been shown in figure 2.7. The scatter in fatigue strength is inversely associated with Kr. In addition, welded joints with greater fatigue resistance show more scatter in their S-N diagrams (for the ripple and toe class welds) and the slopes in their S-N diagrams are more nearly horizontal [8].

2.4.2 Application of the notch strain approach
The notch strain approach is introduced to evaluate fatigue damage of welded joints, where cracks are more likely to initiate (see figure 2.8). Critical locations are found in an elastic maximum notch stress analysis performed on the cross sectional model. Different material zones are present in these sites.

WM: weld metal

HAZ: heat affected zone
PM : parent metal

Figure 2.8 Locations for fatigue crack initiation in a butt weld cross section and related
smooth miniaturized comparison specimens (dashed lines) show initiation in weld metal at weld root and in weld metal or heat affected zone at weld toe [3]. As shown in Figure 2.6, life cycles over I 05 correspond to a dominant elastic deformation and for lives less than I 05 cycles, cyclic plasticity is appreciable. Both the elastic and the plastic regimes are described by the Coffin-Manson equation.

Notch root stress and strain components are measures of the elastic and the plastic deformations of materials when the welded component is axially loaded. The notch stresses and strains which are the local stresses and strains at the crack initiation site are determined based on analysis of elastic-plastic stress-strain response at the notch root.

The cyclic stress-strain curve which is estimated by the Ramberg-Osgood relationship forms the hysteresis loops in the stress-strain diagram. In the low cycle fatigue regime (N::; I 05 cycles), hysteresis loops are wider, presenting a higher plastic deformation, while in the high

I9

cycle fatigue regime (N > 10 cycles), the hysteresis loop reduces to a line with a dominant elastic deformation.

2.4.3 Notch analysis-life assessment
The total fatigue life, N,, of welded joints, consists of the crack initiation life, N;, and the crack propagation life, NP, as:

(2. 15)

The crack propagation life of welded joints is integrated from the propagation through thickness of the component and the crack growth across the width of the component as:

NP =NP, +Npw

(2.16)

where Np, is the crack propagation life through the thickness of the sheet and NP"' is the crack growth life across the width of the component.

In the high-cycle fatigue range of N; > 105 cycles, elastic deformation is dominant. The crack initiation life can then be estimated based on the local stress amplitude using Basquin's equation including Morrow ' s mean stress correction as [3]:

(2.17)

where aa is the local stress amplitude, L1a is the local stress range, a j is the fatigue strength coefficient,

2.5 Crack propagation approach
2. 5.1 Principals
The strength and life assessment of a structural component including a welded joint based on the crack propagation approach involves notch root analysis and growth of a crack originating from the notch root. Stable crack propagation includes the cyclic growth of a micro-crack to a macro-crack with dimensions in the order of size of appropriate component dimensions, for example plate thickness. Thus, it is argued that structural components with welded joints include sma11 initial cracks or weld flaws similar to cracks from the beginning, due to poor production situations, so that the component life can be decided based only on crack propagation .

The cralk propagation rate is characterised based on the cyclic stress intensity factor, !1K1, for the mode 1 crack, or its comparable value, according to the Paris and Erdogan equation [17]. Cyclic crack propagation happens as soon as the threshold value of the stress intensity factor

23

is exceeded and ends as soon as a larger crack length results in reaching the load-carrying capacity of the remaining cross section. Generally, the crack path follows the pure mode I condition. The increase in crack length as the number of cycles progresses, is monitored , cycle by cycle, up to final fracture. Crack initiation life according to the notch stress or notch strain approach can be added up to the crack propagation life, found from the crack propagation approach, resulting in the total Iife ( 13].

2. 5. 2 Crack propagation equations; fatigue life assessment
To assess the fatigue strength and service life of welded joints, the Paris and Erdogan equation (15] is employed for estimating the crack propagation rate at the crack tip as (3 , 18]:

da =C(M)"' dN

(2.25)

Fatigue life N is then calculated as:

(2.26)

where ao and ac respectively correspond to the crack size in initiation and failure stages, and

L1K corresponds to the mode I stress intensity factor range and is given as:

(2.27)

Critical crack length, ac, is characterised by the fracture toughness, K1c, yield stress, O"y, and crack geometry factor, Y, as:

(2.28)

The constants C and m are material constants in equation 2.26, and the term Mk is the magnification factor related to a notch stress concentration.

2.6 Notch stress intensity approach for welded joints
There has been no commonly approved fatigue assessment process for welded joints based on notch stress intensity factors until now, because the mentioned method is quite new. The method was applied to fiJlet welds until recently, when related examinations have been 'positively carried out on butt welds. Single groups of researchers, motivated by Lazzarin and Atzori [ 19,20], have developed the notch stress-intensity approach for seam-welded joints.

The weld toe and weld root notch in welded joints are important locations for fatigue crack initiation and propagation, modeJled in the form of either a sharp notch or a curved notch. High stresses happen in this region that can be described by elastically established notch stress intensity factors or for higher stresses, by elastic-plastically established notch stress or strain intensity factors. In the notch stress intensity approach to the fatigue assessment of welded joints in which the weld toe is modelled as a sharp V-notch, the local stress distributions at the crack tip are given based on notch stress intensity factors related to crack modes. An averaged strain energy density at the notch comer is established using the notch intensity factors to derive a specific failure standard. This approach takes account of the notch (located at the weld toe) opening angle and the notch radius, resulting from the nominal stresses.

There is a stress field present close to comer notches just like stress fields close to crack tips, which can be described by stress intensity factors, named 'notch stress intensity factors', different from the typical stress intensity factors related to crack tips. The stress field at a sharp comer notch can be specified by three notch loading modes, similar to the crack opening modes; symmetric mode I stress, anti-symmetric mode II stress and mode III stress. The related notch loading stress modes are normal tension stress, an1, transverse shear stress,
Tn(per),

and longitudinal shear stress,

Tn(par)·

The next chapter focuses on the strain energy density averaged in a small volume around the notch tip or fillet weld toe with a material dependant radius as a fatigue relevant parameter, with changing notch or weld toe opening angles and with varying stress ratios, under conditions of local yielding at the notch tip. ln this regard and for the means of evaluating the total strain energy, the definitions defined through the equations in this section, such as the notch stress-intensity factors, will be used again in the strain energy method equation that will be further explained in the related energy method approach.

CHAPTER THREE
Energy methods in fatigue damage assessment of welded joints
The strain-based, stress-based, and fracture mechanics-based approaches were evaluated for assessment of fatigue strength and life of welded joints in the previous chapter. Stress and strain-based criteria lack in comprehensively addressing materials response required for fatigue damage assessment. During fatigue cycles, both the elastic and plastic strain components and their corresponding stress values are involved to describe fatigue damage phenomena on the tested materials appropriately. Accordingly, the stress-based or strain based approaches cannot adequately evaluate the fatigue response of materials. To modify damage approaches and to construct precise continuum mechanics fundamentals, the fatigue approach should include both the stress and the strain components. Energy-based approaches were introduced for this purpose. These approaches incorporate both stress and strain in damage assessment of materials.

ln applying energy-based failure approaches it has been found that energy-based damage parameters can combine the damage caused by different types of loading. ln addition, it is possible to analyze the damage accumulation of notched components through the energy approach [21]. lt has been confirmed that in the case of large numbers of cycles, the stress and energy models are the best for explaining fatigue, and for a smal1 number of cycles the strain and energy models are superior. Thus, the energy model seems to be universal [22].

ln each category of welded joint, varying from butt welded joint to cruciform joint, the weld toe geometry is mainly comparable to an open notch. The energy approaches describe the simultaneous stress-strain situation in the area near to the weld toe, concerned by the fatigue damage progress. ln this regard, in welded joints subjected to cyclic loading, the highly stressed regions where cracks initiate and spread are normally located at weld toes and roots. Studying the stress-strain regions near the crack initiation locations is an interesting problem, especially when the goal of the study is to create direct relations between energy values, fatigue strength, and factors influencing fatigue, of the structural welded components [23].

This chapter discusses energy-based methods available in the literature for fatigue assessment

30

of welded joints. Energy-based approaches are described in detail in the present chapter and wilJ be employed for fatigue assessment of welded joints in the foJiowing chapters. Energy approaches examined in this chapter, chosen to be the most popular, and different in methodology, are: · · · Hysteresis loop energy method Fracture mechanics energy approach; known as notch stress-intensity method Critical plane/energy method

The Masing material type hysteresis loop energy method is estimated from stress-strain hysteresis loops, generated by a symmetric doubling of Masing's rule. This energy method has been evaluated to assess fatigue damage of welded joints with low alJoy steels and carbon steels as parent metals [24]. The energy-based fracture mechanics approach is a notch stressintensity based method developed lately [25]. This approach was evaluated by means of the numerical simulations and the experimental verifications are yet to fully support the method to assess fatigue damage in butt-joint welds. The critical plane/energy damage model accounts for states of stress through combining the normal and shear strain and stress ranges acting on the critical plane, and has shown success in evaluating fatigue damage of notched metalJic specimens. The model wilJ be used to assess the fatigue of welded joints in this study. Energy-based approaches will be discussed for their parameters, formulations and applicabilities.

3.1 Hysteresis loop energy method
As previously mentioned structures and components are often subjected to cyclic loads leading to deformation. In addition, many structures and components that include welded joints are severe stress raisers. At these stressed sites, the local stress and strain will exceed the elastic limit. Such situations are very common; resulting in early failures in parts planned for long life applications. The basic fatigue curve for a specific material provides the designer the pertinent material data required to design against failure under dynamic loads. Since fatigue damage is usually caused by elastic-plastic cyclic strain, the dissipated elastic-plastic strain energy is important, and the difference between different life ranges is related to the amount of dissipated strain energy.

31

Many empirical studies show that most materials show a certain degree of cyclic softening and hardening during cyclic loading tests. The cyclic hardening and softening response is presented by comparing stress-strain response of materials subjected to the tensile monotonic load and the fatigue cycles. It has been found that the cyclic deformation resistance varies for the welded joints [26]: the weld metal, the heat affected zone and the base metal. For weld metals, cyclic softening happens during initial cycles; then the material achieves its stabilized stress-strain after 100-200 cycles. The heat affected zone softens slightly under cyclic loading. The base metal is clearly different from the other two zones, which are more similar in mechanical behaviour to one another. The base metal cyclically softens at low strain amplitudes. At higher strain amplitudes the material first softens and then hardens as the cyclic loading progresses [26].

The calculation of notch stresses and strains is based on the stabilized cyclic stress-strain curve. The cyclic stress-strain curve is generated by the Ramberg-Osgood equation (2.19). The stabilized cyclic stress-strain hysteresis loop diagram is estimated by Masing's hypothesis by doubling the amplitudes of the cyclic stress-strain curve for each cycle. Masing's theory allows the stabilized loop to be estimated for a material that shows symmetric behaviour in tension and compression. Figure 3.1 schematically presents a hysteresis loop generated based on Masing's theory.

The area within the loop corresponds to the dissipated plastic energy per cycle {per unit volume of the material), representing a measure of the plastic deformation work/energy done on the material. Figure 3.2 shows the cyclic stress-strain energy area in the hysteresis loop.

Figure 3.2 Cyclic stress-strain stabilized curve and energy area in the hysteresis loop for Masing material [17].

The Ramberg-Osgood equation (2.19) relates the local stress range and the local strain range for Masing materials, and its terms are expressed in equations 3 .I - 3.3:

The plastic strain energy per cycle is the area of the hysteresis loop, and the total dissipated energy is computed from the areas of the hysteresis loops. Each material has the capacity to dissipate a specific amount of energy, and crack propagates when this limit is reached, resulting in failure. If the hysteresis loop stabilizes after a few cycles ( 100-200 cycles), the strain energy per cycle stays unchanged during fatigue cycles. Usually the plastic strain energy is calculated from the hysteresis loop at half-life [28]. The plastic energy range, L1Wp,

33

is calculated based on components of the stress range (Lio-) and the plastic strain range (Lit:p) extracted from stabilized stress-strain hysteresis loops as [24]:

~w = <--)~o-~t:p

(3.4)

where n' is the cyclic hardening exponent.

Substituting for the plastic strain range and the stress range from the Coffin-Manson equation, equation 3.4 is rewritten as:

(3.5)

The results of calculations for the life of welded joints, Nr, for joints made of low-alloy steels and pearlitic steels, welded by means of covered electrodes, submerged arc welding and electroslag welding, agree well with experimental test results justifying the usage of the above-mentioned equation for plastic strain energy in welded joints [24].

3.2 Fracture mechanics energy method
The geometry of the weld bead cannot be accurately defined because the weld bead shape and toe radius change in different joints due to the nature of the welding procedure even in well controlled welding operations. The weld toe is an important location for fatigue crack initiation and propagation in which high stresses are present. The local stresses at the crack tip are based on notch stress intensity factors related to mode I, II and III notch intensity factors. Based on the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) method, the fatigue life of welded joints is taken as crack propagation at the toe of the weld seam. LEFM relates the applied stress to the crack propagating on the welded joints as the number of cycles progresses. The goal is to find an averaged value for the strain energy density in the welded joints of structural steels and aluminium alloys with a V notch (angle of 135°) at the weld toe, where stresses are highly concentrated [29].

34

Fatigue damage includes damages generated due to failure stage. Sharp notches and the cracks emanating from the notch root, severely reduce the life of components under fatigue cycles. Lazzarin et al. [29] have introduced a strain energy density approach to estimate fatigue failure of welded joints. Based on this approach, fatigue failure occurs when the average value of the total or plastic strain energy density reaches a critical value in a cylindrical volumetric region around the notch tip with a radius Rc, independent of the loading mode. The deviatoric strain energy density ( W d ) components were averaged over a cylindrical sector with radius Rc, and resulted in equations 3.6-3 .8 as [3]:

3.3 Critical plane/energy method
ln the critical plane-energy fatigue damage model, both the normal and the shear energies are computed on the most damaging plane of materials, referred to as the critical plane, introduced first by Varvani [3 1]. The critical plane/energy parameter is defined on specific planes and accounts for ' states of stress through combining the normal and shear strain and stress ranges. This damage approach depends upon the choice of the critical plane and the stress and strain ranges acting on that specific plane.

ln Varvani's fatigue damage approach, the critical plane is defined by the largest shear strain and stress Mohr's circles during the reversals of a cycle, and the model consists of tensorial stress and strain range components acting on this critical plane. The model addresses in-phase and out-of phase fatigue and where the additional strain hardening is concerned. The range of maximum shear stress, 11Tma.x, and shear strain, 11(Yma./2), found from the largest stress and strain Mohr's circles for loading and unloading during the first and the second reversals of a loading cycle and the related normal stress range, 11CJn, and the normal strain range, 11cn, on that plane are the components of this approach, shown in figure 3.5. Both the normal and shear strain energies are weighted by the axial and shear fatigue properties, respectively, and the model, unlike many other models, does not use any empirical fitting factor [31].

CHAPTER FOUR Cyclic stress-fatigue life data assortment, calculations based on energy models and numerical analysis of Kt for welded joints

The available experimental data are first converted to terms required in energy approaches, and the model and the values are used accordingly to assess damage of welded joints using energy-based approaches. This chapter provides details of experimental data and testing procedures conducted by various authors and laboratories followed by the methodology of calculations for energy-based models. In addition, a numerical analysis for notch stressconcentration factor, K,, has been carried out using finite element analysis.

4.1 Fatigue data for welded joints
To evaluate the energy based fatigue damage analysis proposed in this study, fatigue data of different types of seam-welded joints have been extracted from the available literature. Appendix A, Appendix B and Appendix C tabulate experimental data including; S-N data, stress-strain data for the material properties of the base metals of the welded joints, and specimen geometry and dimensions. The S-N tables present the nominal stress range or the maximum stress values in MPa applied to a specific welded joint versus fatigue endurance life in number of cycles. The nominal applied stresses will be used to calculate the local stresses and the fatigue lives, based on Neuber's notch analysis. It must be noted that because a11 welded joints selected from the literature are laboratory prepared welds, they have been considered as an 'ideal weldment' in which the fatigue crack is assumed to initiate at the weld toe, probably in the weld metal [8].

4.1.1 Chapetti et a/. data
Chapetti et al. [32] performed fatigue tests on steel butt-welded specimens under transverse stress loading conditions. Simple double-sided butt-welded joints of 12.5 mm thickness were made using conventional manual metal arc welding (MMA W). Figure 4.1 (a) represents the butt-welded joint fatigue tested by Chapetti et al. The parent metal for the welded joints was a low carbon steel En2b (0.2 weight percentage carbon, 0.8 weight percentage Manganese). All

39

specimens were fully stress relieved at 600° C immediately and then fatigue tested with a frequency of 50 Hz and stress ratio of R=0.1. The weld cap height of h=2 mm from the base metal and the weld angle of 8=135° were held constant in their experiments. The fatigue tests on the welded specimens were performed based on uniaxial loading conditions. The S-N data generated from these experiments were extended over low and high cycle fatigue regimes. The nominal stress range versus fatigue life addressing the low and the high cycle fatigue regimes are tabulated in Appendix A. The cyclic stress-strain properties of AISI 1025 structural steel as the base metal of the welded joints are presented in Appendix B. The geometric and dimensional specifications of the welded joints are presented in Appendix C.

4.1. 2 Livieri and Lazzarin data with reference to steel welded cruciform structure
Livieri and Lazzarin [30] performed fatigue tests on cruciform steel joints with non-load carrying double-fillet welds with base metal and attachment of 13 mm x 10 mm, 25 mm x 32 mm, and 38 mm x 220 mm in dimension. Figure 4.1 (b) represents the cruciform joint fatigue tested by Livieri and Lazzarin. The parent metal for the welded joint was a low carbon type steel BS 4360:50D. All specimens were 'as-welded', made using conventional MMA W. Failures systematically originated from the weld toes. The weld heights from the base metal and the weld angles on the four sides were held constant; h=8 mm and 8=135°, h=9 mm and 8=135°, and h=15 mm and 8=135° respectively. The fatigue tests on the welded specimens were performed based on a uniaxial loading condition, with stress ratio of R=O. The S-N data generated from these experiments were extended over low and high cycle fatigue regimes. The nominal stress range versus fatigue life addressing the low and the high cycle fatigue regimes are tabulated in Appendix A. The cyclic stress-strain properties of AISI 1025 structural steel as the base metal of the welded joints are presented in Appendix B. The geometric and dimensional specifications of the welded joints are presented in Appendix C.

4.1.3 Livieri and Lazzarin data with reference to aluminium butt-welded structure
Livieri and Lazzarin [30] performed fatigue tests on aluminium aHoy butt-welded specimens under transverse stress loading conditions. Single sided butt-ground welded joints (removed weld caps) with a thickness of 9.5 mm were used. Figure 4.1 (c) represents the butt-ground 40

welded joint fatigue tested by Livieri and Lazzarin. The parent metal for the welded joint was 5083-H 113 aluminium alloy. This alloy is a strong magnesium-manganese-chromiumaluminium alloy (AJMg4.5Mn), with a very good weld-ability and a high ductility property. The fatigue tests on the welded spedimens were performed based on a uniaxial loading condition, with stress ratio of R=O. The S-N data generated from these experiments were extended over low and high cycle fatigue regimes. The nominal stress range versus fatigue life addressing the low and the high cycle fatigue regimes are tabulated in Appendix A. The cyclic stress-strain properties of AIMg4.5Mn aluminium a11oy as the base metal of the welded joints are presented in Appendix B. The geometric and dimensional specifications of the welded joints are presented in Appendix C.

4.1. 4 Reemsnyder data
Reemsnyder [33] performed fatigue tests on steel butt-welded specimens under transverse stress loading conditions with different weld cap heights of h=I.5 mm, h=2.3 mm, and h=3.8 mm. Simple double-sided butt-welded steel joints with a thickness of 19.1 mm were used. Figure 4.1 (a) represents the butt-welded joint fatigue tested by Reemsnyder. The parent metal for the welded joint was quenched and tempered carbon steel. The fatigue tests on the welded specimens were performed based on a uniaxial loading condition, with stress ratio of

R=O. The S-N data generated from these experiments were extended over low and high cycle
fatigue regimes. The nominal stress range versus fatigue life addressing the low and the high cycle fatigue regimes are tabulated in Appendix A. The cyclic stress-strain properties of 1OB21 carbon steel as the base metal of the welded joints are presented in Appendix B. The geometric and dimensional specifications of the welded joints are presented in Appendix C.

4.1.5 Webber data
Webber [34] performed fatigue tests on aluminium alloy double butt-strap fillet (lap) load carrying welded specimens under transverse stress loading conditions. Welded joints with a base metal thickness of 12 mm were used. Figure 4.1 (d) represents the butt-strap fillet welded joint fatigue tested by Webber. The parent metal for the welded joint was DGFVE 232A aluminium alloy. This alloy is a strong magnesium-manganese-zinc-aluminium a11oy (Al-Zn-Mg), with a very good weld-ability property, with fatigue characteristics in between 7075-T6 and 2024-T3 aluminium a11oys [35]. All specimens were 'as-welded', made using

41

the metal-inert-gas (MIG) process usmg 5.2Mg-0.7Mn welding wtre with argon as the shielding gas. The weld height and weld angle in the experiments were h=12 mm and 8==135° respectively. The fatigue tests on the welded specimens were performed based on a uniaxial loading condition, with a frequency of 33 Hz and stress ratio of R=O. The S-N data generated from these experiments were extended over low and high cycle fatigue regimes. The nominal stress range versus fatigue life addressing the low and the high cycle fatigue regimes are tabulated in Appendix A. The cyclic stress-strain properties of Al-Zn-Mg aluminium alloy as the base metal of the welded joints are presented in Appendix B. The geometric and dimensional specifications ofthe welded joints are presented in Appendix C.

4.2 Energy calculations for welded joints
ln order to perform the calculations presented in this part, the parameters in the three energy based models introduced in chapter three are calculated separately for each model from the original experimental data obtained from the literature related to each weld joint. The data used as a basis for the calculations of the three energy based models for different weld joints include: cyclic stress-strain properties related to the base metal material type of the weld joints, dimensional and geometrical information on the weld joints, and stress versus endurance cycle tables obtained from the tests performed on the welded joints. All the mentioned variables are parameters influencing the fatigue life of a welded joint. After the terms required in each energy equation are obtained from each data set and submitted in the equations, the energy amounts are calculated from the individual energy equations for each endurance cycle related to the data set. The results are separate energy versus endurance cycle tables for each data set obtained from each energy-based equation. The methods and equations used for obtaining the parameters of each energy model are explained systematically.

4.2.1. Hysteresis loop energy calculations
In order to calculate the energy values for the hysteresis- loop energy method, the model
introduced in section 3.1 (equation 3.5) is used. This model originates from the plastic strain energy equation for Masing type metallic material (equation 3.4). After finding all the required parameters for the selected base metal for each set of experimental data used in this study, from Appendix A and Appendix B, the values are inserted in the hysteresis-loop energy model (equation 3.5). The results are energy values for experimental number of endurance cycles obtained from the related experimental data sets, presented in tables m Appendix Fin addition to parameters required for the calculations.

Figure 4.2 shows a general algorithm for the determination of hysteresis-loop energy values using the related criterion.

4.2. 2. Notch stress- intensity energy calculations
In order to calculate the energy values for the notch stress-intensity method, Lazzarin ' s model introduced in section 3.2 (equation 3.1 0) is used. This model, which is based on an averaged value for the strain energy density at the notch tip at the weld toe, combines energy values related to mode I, II and III notch stress intensity factors based on local stresses at the notch ti p. The total energy value is found through the summation of mode I, II and III notch stress intensity factor energies. For a cyclic uniaxial applied load, the second and third energy terms related to the mode II and mode III stresses are equal to zero leaving the mode I stress energy as the only present energy expression.

The nominal stress range, LIS, or maximum stress, Smax, which can be found in Appendix A for each set of given data, is the stress range or maximum stress, applied to each welded joint, required for obtaining the local stress, a, at the weld toe of the welded joints. Appendix B provides a11 the required cyclic stress-strain properties used for some of the parameters needed for the calculations. Appendix C is used for calculating the geometry factor, k1, required for the notch stress-intensity factor, K1, with the assumption that the notch-opening angle has been held constant and equal to 135°. The related notch loading stress modes; normal tension stress,
an,

transverse shear stress,

Tn(per),

and longitudinal shear stress,

Tn (par),

used for calculating the notch stress intensity factors, K1, K2 and K3, are actually local stresses

44

at the weld toe. It must be noted that in the case of cyclic uniaxial applied stress, the local stress, S, is the normal tension stress, an,, which is the only stress present. The transverse shear stress,
Tn(per),

and longitudinal shear stress,

Tn(par),

which are the shear stresses

perpendicular to the welded joint base plate and parallel to the welded joint base plate respectively, are not present, therefore have zero values. To obtain the fatigue notch factor needed for finding the local stresses from the nominal stresses (equation 2.23), it is required to find the elastic notch stress-concentration factor, K,. Appendix D is used to obtain K,, needed for K1 (figure 2.4). For this purpose, required parameters are given in Appendix E. In this regard, a weld toe radius of 0.5 mm 1 has been considered for all joints. ln addition, for the double fillet joint, a root face to base metal thickness ratio2 of 0.5 has been considered.

After obtaining all the required parameters for each set of experimental data used in this study, the values are inserted in Lazzarin's notch stress-intensity energy model resulting in energy values related to the experimental number of endurance cycles. The local stresses obtained from the experimental nominal stresses, the calculated energy values for each local stress and the experimental numbers of endurance cycles for the nominal stresses, in addition to all of the calculated parameters in this section, for each set of experimental data used in this study, are presented in tables in Appendix F.

Figure 4.3 shows a general algorithm for the determination of notch stress-intensity energy values using the related criterion.

The weld toe radius ranges from 0 to 1. A value of 0.5 is the average value [3]. The root face thickness at the welded joint is reduced before welding in order to decrease stress concentration factor. The root face to plate thickness ratio ranges from 0 to 1; 1 resulting in the highest stress concentration factor (see Appendix D) [3].

4. 2.3. Critical plane energy calculations
In order to calculate the energy values for the critical plane/energy method, Varvani ' s model introduced in section 3.3 (equation 3.11) is used. This model combines the axial and shear energies through their summation. For the first part of the model, the axial energy, axial fatigue strength coefficient, axial fatigue ductility coefficient, normal stress range, and normal strain range are needed; and for the second part of the model, the shear energy, shear fatigue strength coefficient, shear fatigue ductility coefficient, range of maximum shear stress, and range of maximum shear strain are needed.

The procedure of calculating local stresses from nominal stresses and finding K, and calculating K1 are similar to the calculations in the previous method. Appendix B provides all the required cyclic stress-strain properties used for some of the parameters needed for the calculations. After finding all the required parameters through calculations or from the cyclic stress-strain properties table for the selected base metal for each set of experimental data used in this study, the values are inserted in Varvani's critical plane/energy model equation resulting in energy values for each local stress, related to the experimental number of endurance cycles. The local stresses obtained from the experimental nominal stresses, the calculated energy values for each local stress and the experimental numbers of endurance cycles for the nominal stresses, in addition to all of the calculated parameters mentioned in this section, for each set of experimental data used in this study, are presented in tables in Appendix F.

Figure 4.4 shows a general algorithm for the determination of critical plane/energy values using the related criterion.

4.3 Numerical analysis of Kt for welded joints
The notch stress-concentration factor, K,, at the weld toes of the welded joints is defined as the ratio of the local stress at the weld toe and the nominal stress applied to the welded part (equation 2.14). The nominal stress corresponds to the load applied to the gross cross sectional area of the structure, while the maximum notch stress corresponds to the peak stress at the weld toe. The maximum notch stress can be obtained based on numerical methods such as the finite element method. The stress concentration factor depends on geometric parameters of the welded joint such as the width and height of the reinforcement (in the case of butt joints), the weld length (in the case of fillet joints), weld angle of the reinforcement, base plate thickness, and the radius of the weld toe. Not all geometric data of weldments needed for the notch stress analysis are included in the welded joint design specifications. Some data such as the width and height of the weld cap, the weld toe angle, and the weld toe radius depend on the welding procedure and quality [3]. The stress concentration factor was numerically evaluated using ANSYS finite element software [36] for various welded joints. The fatigue notch factor, K1; was then evaluated based on notch sensitivity factor, q ;
K -1 q = _r_ (equation 2.14), and Peterson ' s equation [37]: K, -1

The investigated welded joints are the steel butt joint of Chapetti et al. [32], the 13x 10 mm steel cruciform joint of Livieri and Lazzarin [30], the carbon steel butt joint of Reemsnyder (h=l.5 mm) [33] and the aluminium alloy double butt-strap fillet joint of Webber [34]. The critical site in the welded joints is defined as the node experiencing maximum stress based on

49

finite element (FE) analysis. This node is also the most likely location for emanating a fatigue crack at the weld toe.

4.4 FE modeling and element specifications
The welded joints have been modeled in a structural two-dimensional plane strain condition. The local geometry and related dimensions for the weldments were considered in the twodimensional FE model. These local dimensions include the width/length and height of the weld cap, weld angle of the reinforcement, base plate thickness, and the radius of weld toes.

Eight-node finite element (PLANE82) has been utilized for the welded joint models. The eight-node structural solid element is a high order two-dimensional eight-node element. It offers precise results for the mixed quadrilateral-triangular automatic meshes and can accept asymmetrical shapes without much loss of precision. PLANE82 has a quadratic dislocation performance, and well-matched displacement shapes, and is appropriate to model uneven and unequal meshes and curved boundaries, which are common in welded joints. The eightnodes with two degrees of freedom in each node describe this element moving along the nodal x and y directions.

For modeling of the welded joints, a solid two-dimensional model with very fine triangular mesh element size 1 has been employed. The modeled welded joints have been considered as isotropic and linearly elastic materials, with allowable relative displacement, Ux, in Xdirection at which the maximum applied stress (nominal stress) was applied. The value of Poisson's ratio ( v), employed for FE models of the steel joints and aluminium joint has been 0.30 and 0.35 respectively. The elastic modulus (E) values used for the FE models of the welded joints have been obtained from Appendix B. Corresponding local stresses were calculated at the critical site where the weld toe experiences the highest stress concentration.

A two-dimensional solid model was utilized to numerically determine the local stress at the weld toe of the welded joints reported by Chapetti et al. [32], Livieri and Lazzarin [30] , Reemsnyder [33] and Webber [34] for both steel and aluminium alloy. Figures 4.5-4.8 present two-dimensional solid meshed models developed for butt-welded, cruciform welded and double butt-strap fillet welded joints. For the models in figures 4.6 and 4.8, boundary conditions were located, preventing displacements parallel to the Y -axis ( Ux) and parallel to

50

the X-axis (Uy). For the model in figure 4.7, boundary conditions prevented displacements parallel to the X-axis (Uy).

CHAPTER FIVE Results of fatigue damage assessment and FEA for welded joints
Results of nominal stress and fatigue life cycles obtained experimentally in welded joints of steels and aluminium alloys are presented in this chapter. The fatigue tests were performed under uniaxial loading conditions and reported in the literature. The results presented here are the basis for the energy-based damage analysis. It is intended to evaluate fatigue damage of welded joints, based on energy-based fatigue approaches discussed in chapter 3. The capabilities of energy approaches in damage assessment are also presented. In addition, the results of the performed FEA of chapter 4 are presented.

For curve-fitted S-N data, the slope is presented in these figures. The S-N curves help significantly to estimate the fatigue resistance and stress raising effect of the tested welded joints through the scatter index and curve slope.

The welded joints in Reemsnyder data with carbon steel base metal of 1OB2 1 (weld cap heights ranging from 1.5-2.3 mm) and Lazzarln data with reference to aluminium aHoy base metal of 5083-Hl13 (removed weld cap) have the highest scatter indexes. Their curve fitted line regression values are equal to 0.843, 0.722 and 0.978 respectively (in addition to the lowest slope values of: 0.148, 0.140 and 0.170 respectively). Although the aluminium joint of Lazzarin has the weakest base metal with ultimate tensile strength of 363 MPa, it follows the j oint of Reemsnyder, having the strongest base metal with ultimate tensile strength of 814 MPa, in terms of low slope and high scatter. The calculated fatigue notch factors for the carbon steel joints of Lazzarin are equal to K_F2. 15 and for the aluminium butt joint of Lazzarin it is equal to KF 1, which is the smallest value of the calculated fatigue notch factors. The welded joint in Reemsnyder data with a weld cap of 3.8 mm has a low scatter index, with a curve fitted line regression value equal to 0.982 and a high slope value of 0.33. The calculated fatigue notch factor for this joint is equal to K_F2.15 , a relatively sma11 value2 . The 25x32 and 38x220 mm cruciform welded joints in Lazzarin data with reference to steel base metal of BS 4360:50D have the lowest scatter indexes, with curve fitted line regression values equal to 0.997 and 0.990 respectively (and high slope values of 0.32 and 0.41 respectively). The calculated fatigue notch factors for these joints are equal to K_F3.585 and
KF4 .4, very high values (largest values of the calculated fatigue notch factors). In this regard
1

the 3 8x220 mm cruciform welded joint of Lazzarin with the highest fatigue notch factor
(Kr 4.4) also has the highest slope or the least horizontal curve (slope value of 0.41). The

welded joints in Chapetti et al. data with low carbon steel base metal of En2b and Webber data with Al-Zn-Mg aluminium a11oy have fatigue notch factors equal to KF2 and K_Fl.95. Their curve slope values are 0.20 and 0.23 respectively, which stand in between the curve slopes of other welded joints.

A regression value ofR=J represents fatigue data fallen on the fitted straight line. Fatigue notch factor, K1, of 1.8 to 2.5 is considered a relatively small value and 3.0 to 4.5 is considered a very high val ue [8].

5.2 Energy-fatigue life (W-N) response
CaJculated energy values based on three energy-based approaches are plotted versus fatigue life data in figures 5.1 0-5.12. Experimental life data for different weldments were extracted from available literature and energy values are tabulated in tables F2.1-F2.27 of Appendix F.

The mean regression values for the data sets related to the hysteresis loop energy model, the notch stress-intensity energy model, and the critical plane/energy model are R=0.91 0, R=0.972, and R=0.944, respectively. ln addition, the mean curve slope absolute values for the data sets related to the hysteresis-loop energy model, the notch stress-intensity energy model, and the critical plane/energy model are 0.64, 0.46, and 0.98, respectively. The maximum convergence of the energy value scatter-points belongs to the notch stress-intensity energy model, whereas the maximum curve slope of the energy value belongs to the critical plane/energy model. It must be noted that in terms of scatter, the critical plane/energy model follows the notch stress-intensity model closely, whereas in terms of curve slope value, the critical plane/energy model is more than twice the notch stress-intensity model.

Fatigue damage and life assessments of butt-welded joints can be evaluated based on energybased approaches for sets of different materials presented in figures 5.10-5.12 using the scatter and curve slope criteria. The critical plane/energy approach and the notch stressintensity approach in figures 5.11 and 5.12 show different slopes of W-N curves as the welded joint's data changes, whereas the hysteresis-loop energy approach fails to differentiate W-N curves, as values of slopes in figure 5.1 0, except for one data set, stay unchanged. In terms of convergence of the energy value scatter-points, the hysteresis-loop energy approach has the least scatter convergence between the three energy models. The mean energy values have been calculated separately for each data set for the energy models, and the values for the hysteresis loop model, the notch stress-intensity model, and the critical plane/energy model for all the data sets have been found. These values are presented in Appendix G.

5.3 Results of FEA for welded joints

The present section discusses the numerical results of finite element analysis for various welded joints. The results include the maximum local stresses at the weld toes where the stress is highly concentrated. Figures 5.13-5.20 clearly show the local stress contours in the welded joints. For each obtained maximum local stress, the stress concentration factor, Kt, has been calculated. Finite element analysis has been performed for various welded components discussed in this study. The stress values in the X direction acquired from the nodal solution of the FE solid model show that the highest stress values are located at the weld toes. The results from the FEA confirmed that the weld toes as the nodal points with maximum local stresses are most likely locations for the fatigue crack initiation.

CHAPTER SIX
Discussion
This chapter carries out discussions based on the obtained results of the energy models, already presented in the previous chapter and compares the energy-lifetime curves with each other, including their slopes and their ability to unify fatigue data. The nominal stress-fatigue life data sets and the effects of the fatigue variables on the energy-based models, welded joint material , and joint types, are discussed in detail. In addition, W-N diagrams generated based on energy based models for welded joints are compared and discussed for butt welded joints, cruciform welded joints, and a double butt-strap fillet welded joint with different materials.

The relation between factors influencing fatigue ; applied stress amplitude, material properties, geometrical stress concentration effects, and energy values can be studied based on the energy values presented in the W-N diagrams, which do not primarily reflect the effect of ultimate tensile strength of the base metal on the welded joints. On the other hand, fatigue assessment based on the S-N approach, does not reflect the main parameters influencing fatigue.

In the energy approaches, the fatigue notch factor, Kr, has an affect on the energy values through increasing the local stress, which results in the increase in energy. In addition, for the notch stress-intensity energy approach, the mean energy values for each data set have a direct positive correlation with the fatigue notch factor obtained for that specific data set. For the notch stress-intensity and critical plane/energy approaches, the lowest energy values belong to Lazzarin data (aluminium joint reference), with the lowest fatigue notch factor, while the energy values belonging to other data sets do not have any specific relation with their related fatigue notch factors. The stress raising effect of the welded joint is directly applied to the notch stress-intensity energy model and critical plane/energy model through the calculated local stress. No apparent direct link between the fatigue notch factor and the hysteresis-loop energy model can be found.

The stress raising effect of the weld, represented through the fatigue notch factor K1 of the welded joints, somehow shows an effect on the induced damage through the obtained energy

70

values in this study. In this regard, the fatigue notch factor, Kh of the weldment, can be reduced through a technique that has been applied in industry for some time with great success, for fatigue strength improvement of butt and fi11et welded joints through applying weld grinding. This can result in lower energy values indicating less damage in the welded joint.

It must be noted that the S-N diagrams presented in the previous chapter clearly show that the

main parameter designating fatigue resistance in welded joints is not principally the ultimate tensile strength of the base metal, but the fatigue notch factor, K1, of the specific joint, resulting from the joint geometry and welding procedure. In this regard, it was shown that the welded joints with the lowest fatigue notch factors, such as Reemsnyder's butt-joints (h 1= 1.5 mm and h=2.3 mm) and Lazzarin's aluminium butt-joint, with Kr2.1 0, Kr2.30 and KF1, respectively, have the lowest S-N curve slope values (0.148, 0.140 and 0.170, respectively), while the welded joints with the highest fatigue notch factors, such as Lazzarin's steel cruciform joints (25 x32, 38x220 mm) and Reemsnyder's butt-joint (h=3 .8 mm), with KF3.585, KF4.4 and Kr2.35, respectively, have the highest S-N curve slope values (0.32, 0.41 and 0.33, respectively). This reiterates the theory already mentioned that welded joints with greater fatigue resistance have S-N diagrams that are more nearly horizontal [8]. This will be further investigated in comparing W-N curves of butt versus cruciform joints and different butt joints (figures 6.1 0-6.15). It must be noted that the reason for the high curve slope in the case of the butt joint ofReemsnyder with h=3.8 mm, although having a fatigue notch factor of Kr2.35, could only be its high weld cap; contributing to a decrease in fatigue strength in the welded joint.

For the cruciform steel joint ofLazzarin with three different sizes (13xl0, 25x32, 38x220 mm), the presented S-N diagrams show an increase in curve slope values (0.30, 0.32 and 0.41, respectively), with the increase in base plate thickness, indicating decrease in fatigue strength of the welded joints. This reiterates the theory that the fatigue strength of a cruciform welded joint decreases greatly as both the main plate thickness ratio, and the attachment thickness, increase, especially for large variations, which could occur with non-load-carrying attachments in cruciform joints [3 8,3 9].

h: weld cap or weld reinforcement height.

71

For the butt joint of Reemsnyder with three different weld cap heights ( 1.5, 2.3 and 3.8 mm) the presented S-N diagrams show an increase in curve slope values (0.13, 0.14 and 0.33 , respectively) in addition to an increase in scatter index value from 0.882 to 0.982 as the weld cap height increases from 1.5 mm to 3.8 mm. This indicates a decrease in fatigue strength of the welded joints reiterating the theory that the fatigue strength of a butt-welded joint decreases with the increase in the height of the reinforcement cap and the increase of weld angle [4,40] and that lower fatigue strengths are related to welds that have a meager shape; welds with excess weld reinforcement [5]. This issue was observed in the case of the butt j oint of Reemsnyder with weld cap height of 3.8 mm , possessing a high curve slope value of 0.33, being categorized with the joints with high Kf values ranging from 2.55-4.4 and curve slope values ranging from 0.3-0.41. This will be further investigated in comparing W-N curves of butt joints with different weld cap heights (figures 6.13-6.15).

The W-N diagrams presented for all data sets in the previous chapter (figures 5.1 0-5.12), clearly show distinctive curve slopes for different types of joints in both the notch stressintensity and critical plane/energy approach (ranging from 0.28-0.66 and 0.28-1.80, respectively). The critical plane/energy approach shows considerably higher slopes (average slope value of 0.95) compared to the notch stress-intensity approach (average slope value of 0.46). In this regard, the hysteresis loop energy approach does not show great difference in curve slope for different types of joints (ranging from 0.68-0.78) except for the joint of Webber (K_F1.95) showing the least curve slope value of0.254.

The W-N curves were generated based on energy-based fatigue models, for separate data sets, showing maximum convergence by the notch stress-intensity model and maximum slope by the critical plane/energy model. Comparison of energy-based models for assessing fatigue life of welded joints of different joints/materials is presented in figures 6.1-6.9.

These figures show that the critical plane/energy model possesses the highest slope of W-N curves. A higher slope of W-N curves provides less variation of life data along life-axis at any given energy value resulting in a better fatigue life prediction. The lowest slopes in W-N diagrams belong to Lazzarin's energy model ofweldedjoints under axial loading conditions.

Figure 6.9 Energy versus fatigue life data for aJJ energy models for Webber data.

While the notch stress-intensity energy model shows slightly better scatter convergence for butt and fiJJet joints presented in figures 6.1 - 6.9, 6.11-6.12 and 6.14-6.15 as compared with the critical plane/energy model, the critical plane/energy model shows a considerably higher curve slope. This indicates that for any given energy value, the obtained fatigue life range resulting from the diagram scatter band, is significantly sma11er. This enables a design engineer to predict fatigue life of welded joints more accurately with Jess scatter.

Figures 6.1 0-6.12 present w.:.N diagrams for butt joints versus fi11et joints made from low carbon steel calculated based on the energy approaches. In figures 6.10-6.12 the butt-welded joint possesses a fatigue notch factor of K_F2.0 while Kf for the cruciform (double-fiJJet) welded joint (I Ox 13 mm) is 25% higher in magnitude. The higher value of K1 shortens the fatigue life of the double-fi11et welded joint. The reduction in life based on the hysteresis-loop energy approach exceeds 4 times. This reduction in life, based on the critical plane/energy approach is up to I 0 times. The notch stress-intensity approach however shows no reduction in life (figure 6.11 ). The hysteresis loop energy approach in figure 6.10 fails to introduce the weaker double-fi11et welded joint of Lazzarin (l3x I 0 mm) in terms of curve slope (curve slope=0.61) compared to the stronger butt-welded joint of Chapetti (curve slope=0.67).

77

Fatigue life assessments of butt versus fillet-welded joints for the same material were evaluated based on energy-based approaches and are presented in figures 6.1 0-6.12. Fatigue life assessments of butt-welded joints were evaluated based on energy-based approaches for three sets of different weld cap height (same material), and are presented in figures 6.136.1 5. Fatigue life assessments of butt-strap fillet versus butt-ground welded joints for aluminium alloys (magnesium-manganese-aluminium alloy) were evaluated based on energybased approaches and are presented in figures 6.16-6.1 8 .

Comparison of W-N diagrams for the low carbon steel butt and cruciform welded joints in figures 6.10--6.12 shows a lower curve slope and higher scatter of energy-life for Chapetti's butt-joint data as compared with Lazzarin's cruciform joint (13x 10 mm) in the notch stressintensity and critical plane/energy models. This clearly designates a stronger joint and lower fatigue notch factor, Kr, for the butt joint in comparison with the cruciform joint of the same material (structural low carbon steel with UTS =547 MPa), indicating that the scatter in energy values is inversely associated with K_t; In addition, the highest scatter convergence in the mentioned energy-lifetime diagrams belongs to the notch stress-intensity model, whereas the highest slope values belong to the critical plane/energy model. The fatigue life of buttjoints of Reemsnyder, with different weld cap heights (same material), was compared as energy based models were employed (figures 6.13-6.15), and it was found that no relation between scatter index and Kt can be seen.
1

The butt joints of Reemsnyder with weld cap height of 1.5 mm (K1 =2.1 0) and weld cap height of 2.3 mm (K1 =2.30) show similar response with the lowest slope values compared to the other butt joint of Reemsnyder with weld cap height of 3.8 mm (Kt =2.35), in the notch stress-intensity and critical plane/energy models in figures 6.13-6.15. This shows that welded joints with greater fatigue resistance have W-N diagrams that are more nearly horizontal. This obviously designates the greatest welded-joint strengths for butt joints of Reemsnyder with weld cap heights of 1.5 mm and 2.3 mm, having relatively small fatigue notch factors. In this regard, the joint of Reemsnyder with weld cap height of 3.8 mm also has a relatively small fatigue notch factor (K 1 =2.35) and is also categorized in the same group as Reemsnyder's joints with weld cap heights of 1.5 and 2.3 mm in terms of fatigue notch factor, but shows higher curve slope in the energy models (figures 6.13-6.15). It must be noted that in equal situations of joint geometry (in terms of KJ), it seems that the joints with smaller weld cap heights show greater fatigue strengths. In this case, the comparison is performed for one type of base metal (quenched and tempered carbon steel with UTS=814 MPa).

Comparison of W-N diagrams for different butt-welded joints in all three energy models in figures 6.13-6.15, shows that the highest curve slope belongs to the joint ofReemsnyder with weld cap height of3.8 mm (KJ=2.35). Although this joint is in the same category as the other

1

Ultimate tensile strength.

83

two butt joints of Reemsnyder (h=I.5 and h=2.3 mm), in terms of fatigue notch factor, it shows a sudden decrease in fatigue strength. This shows that up to 2.3 mm weld cap height, a similar response can be expected in the W-N curves. In this regard, the weakest butt joint of the three compared joints of Reemsnyder, belongs to the joint of Reemsnyder with h=3.8 mm, possibly due to its large weld cap.

Comparison of W-N diagrams for the aluminium alloys butt-strap fillet and butt-ground welded joints in figures 6.16-6.18 shows a lower curve slope and higher scatter of energy-life for Lazzarin's butt-joint data as compared with Webber's butt-strap fiiJet joint in the notch stress-i ntensity and critical plane/energy models. This clearly designates a stronger joint and lower fatigue notch factor, K;; for butt-ground joint type of Lazzarin (Kr =1) in comparison with butt-strap fillet joint type of Webber (K 1 =1.95), for aluminium aiJoys, once again indicating that the scatter in energy values is inversely associated with K1: In addition, both the notch stress-intensity and critical plane/energy models show the same scatter convergence and slope values in the mentioned energy-lifetime diagrams.

ln evaluating the W-N diagrams, it was found that the hysteresis-loop energy model fails to differentiate the stronger welde<;l joints from the weaker welded joints using either the scatter index or the curve slope criteria. The comparison was made for different types of joints with the same material, the same type of joint with different weld cap heights, and different types of joints with similar alloys (figures 6.1 0, 6.13 and 6.16). The critical plane/energy model not only differentiates the stronger welded joints from the weaker welded joints using either the scatter index or the curve slope criteria, but also shows a higher energy level for the stronger joint (with smaller fatigue notch factor) compared to the weaker joint. This could be seen in the comparison of the joints with different geometries; butt joint versus cruciform joint (figure 6.12), and butt joints with different weld cap heights (figure 6.15). In the case of buttstrap fillet joint versus butt-ground joint of similar alloys, both having relatively small values of fatigue notch factor, indicating strong joints, the critical plane/energy model differentiates the stronger welded joint from the weaker welded joint and shows energy levels with close proximity (figure 6.18).

In evaluating fatigue damage of welded joints through the mentioned energy models, another important comparison that must be considered is how readily coefficients/constants are determined and employed in the energy parameters. In the hysteresis-loop energy model, no

84

local stress analysis and fatigue notch factor were required. The fatigue assessment was determined from the nominal stress versus fatigue life data and coefficients of n ', b, c,
r5 'h &'r

from the fatigue properties table of the joint base metaL In the notch stress-intensity energy model , variables such as ed and
~

are obtained from diagrams. Constants such as Rc and E are

available and found from the fatigue properties table of the joint base metaL In order to obtain the stress intensity factor, K , the geometry coefficient, k, is obtained from a diagram through geometric specifications of the joint. Plate thickness is obtained from the geometric specifications of the joint. The eigenvalue, /\ , is obtained from a diagram, and for normal tension stress
r5m,

the local stress amplitude is calculated. In order to find the local stress

amplitude, the local stress must be calculated using the fatigue notch factor, K 1; the stress concentration factor, K,, and the fatigue notch factor, Kh are determined from standard diagrams. Constants such as K' and n ' are used for calculating the local stress, which are obtained from the fatigue properties table of the joint base metal. In the critical plane/energy model, constants such as r5[ and &j·are obtained from the fatigue properties table of the joint base metal. Coefficients such as rj and

r!

are calculated using the obtained constants. In

order to calculate L1r5n, L1&n, L1Tmax, and L1(Ymax12), principal stresses and strains are calculated. For the calculation of principal stresses, the local stress is calculated using Neuber's rule. Once the principal stresses are found, the principal strains are calculated from the RambergOsgood equation.

85

CHAPTER SEVEN
Conclusions and future recommendations
7.1 Conclusions
In order to achieve the most reliable welded joint, under cyclic loading, the state of local stress and strain at the notch root (weld toe) is to be determined. A welded joint is a stress raiser, causing a reduction in fatigue strength of the welded component or structure. Although today fatigue failure of welded joints remains the most common type of failure, unfortunately recognizing this problem at the design stage, before the manufacturing procedure, is not complete yet, and affecting parameters are sti11 unknown due to the complicated nature of the fatigue of weldments. Thus, it is very important that design engineers have sufficient knowledge and information on recent fatigue damage-assessment methods of welded joints.

Fatigue in weldments is a complicated issue due to the nature of the welding process. Considering the complication of the subject and its wide application, it is common to have different approaches for fatigue analysis of welded joints. Fatigue failures in welded joints occur at the weld toe region where the stress is highly localized. In this regard, local approaches can be used based on local stress and strain calculations.

Stress or strain based weld fatigue-assessment methods were reviewed. Stress or strain based criteria are limited to assess fatigue life in the low-cycle or the high-cycle fatigue regimes. The fatigue phenomenon involves cyclic plastic deformation. Energy-based fatigue assessment methods, which are categorized as local approaches, however, involve both the stress and strain components in damage assessment of materials.

Three energy-based methods were employed to assess fatigue of welded joints. These energybased methods consist of the hysteresis-loop energy method, the fracture-mechanics energymethod or notch stress-intensity method, and the critical plane/energy method. Of these methods, only the notch stress-intensity method has been recently developed and applied to welded joints. The purpose was to evaluate the energy-based approaches for fatigue damage assessment of welded joints.

86

Energy versus fatigue life data diagrams (W-N diagrams) were evaluated based on different approaches and compared for different joint/material types: (i) butt versus fillet joint for the same base metal, (ii) butt joints with different weld cap heights (same base metal), and (iii) butt versus butt-strap fillet joint of aluminium alloys. The values of K.t factor for welded joints, which indicate their fatigue strength, are highly influenced by welded joint type. Other parameters such as base plate thickness, weld toe radius, and weld angle were also found to influence the Kt factor value.

The calculated values of K1 factor for various welded joints were evaluated with K, factor values determined by finite element analysis used in the equation resulting from Peterson's equation (equation 4.2) to determine Kt factor required for the energy models.

Energy-based fatigue models of the hysteresis-loop energy method, notch stress-intensity energy method, and the critical plane/energy method have corresponded differently as they were plotted versus fatigue lives. Of these models, the critical plane/energy model possessed a steeper W-N curve slope. This suggests that the critical plane/energy approach has correlated fatigue data of welded joints with less scatter in fatigue life range.

Both approaches of the notch stress-intensity and the critical plane/energy methods are dependant on K1 factor and they incorporate the effect of weld joint types in the fatigue analysis, while the hysteresis-loop energy approach fails to correspond to various joint types as the K1 factor is not used in the analysis. The availability of the coefficients/constants and how readily they are determined and employed in the energy approaches are essential in the damage assessment of welded joints. The critical plane/energy approach is more readily used compared with other energy-based approaches. In addition, it is not based on geometrical specifications of the welded joint, thus reducing the error probability due to dimensional measurements.

Energy approaches were employed to evaluate the fatigue damage of various weld joints under uniaxial loading conditions. Energy-fatigue life (W-N) curves were further discussed and comported for their capabilities in assessing fatigue life of various joints through different parameters including curve slope, life data scatter, and how readily 87

coefficients/constants are determined and employed in the energy methods. The critical plane/energy approach was found to be the most suitable energy-based approach for fatigue damage and life assessment of welded joints by offering sharper W-N curves and less life scatter. This approach also allowed employing readily available material

coefficients/properties as compared with notch stress-intensity energy approach.

7.2 Future recommendations
In spite of vast information on the fatigue of weldments and their various joint types and loading spectrum, the present work reviews three distinct welded joint types under uniaxial fatigue loading conditions. In the current study, only fusion welded joints were considered and the performance of other welded joint types such as spot welded joints, which are mostly applied to thin-walled components, requires further investigation. It is also recommended to investigate fatigue of welded joints at different stress ratios, loading spectrum including multi-axial loading, and variable amplitude loading conditions.
