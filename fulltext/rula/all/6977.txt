Abstract
The research conducted for this study presents a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis to understanding and modelling the impacts of a new competitor on the sales of established businesses within similar markets. Data for this analysis was provided by Canadian Tire Corporation (CTC).This study will outline and create trade areas for all stores in the Part Source network to determine which stores will be the focus of this study. Once focus stores have been determined, sales data was analyzed in two ways. The first analysis was conducted to determine the distance decay effects of the new competitor on sales. The second analysis utilized geographic weighted regression (GWR) models on expenditure and vehicle data.

Introduction
The international expansion of companies into various markets has led to many

researchers to try and understand two main by-products. The first by-product is to understand why a company succeeds and fails in a market. The second by-product is what happens to markets if a company succeeds in entering into it. Shostack (1977), and later Booms and Bitner (1981), identified the 4Ps of marketing; Product, Place, Promotion and Price. Researchers later identified that products compared to services had significant difference which led to the addition of three Ps (Participants, Physical Evidence, and Process) into the model (Anitsal et. al, 2013). According to Foote and Margaret (1995) outlined the issues of analyzing the spatial components due to a lack of technology to effectively collecting and analyze spatial data. While the late 1950s to early 1970s saw the development of sophisticated mathematical algorithms, it wasn't until the early 1990s that the software was being refined and relied upon by companies and organizations (Foote & Margaret 1995). Jeffrey Star and John Estes, defined a Geographic Information System (GIS) as: "an information system that is designed to work with data referenced by spatial or geographic coordinates. In other words, a GIS is both a database system with specific capabilities for spatially-reference data, as well [as] a set of operations for working with data" With technology ever increasing its able to handle larger and larger quantities of data, companies are becoming more and more reliant on spatially referenced data in order to make their decisions (Mishra, 2009). This includes, but is not limited to, site selection, customer and

Page |1

product analysis, determining market share of current locations, and assessing impacts of competitors. In order to assessing impacts of competitors, researchers have sought out various methods to model these effects. One of the most widely used spatial methods is a gravity model. A gravity model is considered to be one of the basic spatial analysis models. Its initial intent to be able to describe the migration of population between two regions but was later adopted for use in understanding and measuring attraction between any two geographic locations (Chen, 2013). Another spatial method that is commonly used is a huff model, which is a more advanced gravity model. ESRI defines a huff model as "the principle that the probability of a given consumer visiting and purchasing at a given site is a function of the distance to that site, its attractiveness, and the distance and attractiveness of competing sites" (How Original Huff Model Works, 2016). The final method that is regularly used is a regression model. A regression model is defined by HBR (Harvard Business Review) as: "A way of mathematically sorting out which of those variables does indeed have an impact. It answers the questions: Which factors matter most? Which can we ignore? How do those factors interact with each other? And, perhaps most importantly, how certain are we about all of these factors?" For the purpose of this study, a sample data of Part Source's postal code sales data will be utilized for the study. With international companies, such as NAPA and Carquest, further expanding into the Canadian market along with competition from other Canadian retailers, such as Princess Auto, Part Source is an excellent candidate to assess the effects of new competitors. Since Part Source was established, it has opened an average of just over 5 locations per year (About Us, 2016). Part Source has had to conservatively expand its network
Page |2

in order to ensure that the markets that they enter into have enough market potential so the new Part Source store can obtain a profitable market share. While Part Source was only established 18 years ago, it is one of five banners, which are Canadian Tire Retail, Canadian Tire Petrolium, Marks, Part Source, and FGL Sports (formerly "The Forzani Group Ltd.") under the CTC (Canadian Tire Corporation) which was established in 1922 (Canadian Tire Corporation, 2016). This means that the site selection process has been rigorously tested and refined and can be utilized in this study with limited concerns about other factors, such as poor site selection or limitations of funds to open multiple stores, affecting the results. Before any focus stores can be determined, it is important to understand how markets are being defined within this study. In many cases, researchers utilize census boundaries such as Census Subdivisions or Census Metropolitan Areas to define markets. While this is beneficial by allowing for easy understanding of boundaries by a larger audience, it limits the potential scope of the analysis. An example of this is utilizing Census Subdivisions to determine competitors within Ontario. If a Part Source was located in the west end of Etobicoke and a competitor opened in the east end of Mississauga, the two would not be considered to be within the same market while the sales would indicate that the competitor has had an impact. While substituting the Census Subdivision boundaries with larger boundaries, such as Census Divisions or Census Metropolitan Areas, would reduce these limitations, there would still be an impact on the amount of potential focus stores. Due to this, developing trade areas, sometimes referred to as catchment areas, was determined to be the best method to mitigate any of these impacts.

Trade areas can be defined using a wide variety of geographies, methods and variables. Some geography boundaries that are used include, but are not limited to, census boundaries, road networks, or custom grids such as squares or hexagons. Many common methods include building buffers using a fixed or varying distance(s), creating Theissen polygons, or amalgamation of smaller geographic boundaries based on a set of criteria. The variables that are most frequently used are population or household counts, counts of vehicles, or sales data. For this study, trade areas will be defined using an amalgamation of Forward Sortation Areas based on sales associated with each store. This study aims to: Determine the spatial patterns of the impacts a new competitor on sales Determine factors behind the spatial pattern using Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR)

Literature Review

The study of new competitor's effects on an existing stores performance in the Canadian retail industry has received interest in theoretical and scholar research. Furthermore, there has been a larger focus on four major topics including: the effects of the international expansion of companies into Canada, factors impacting market share, trade area delineation, and Geographically Weighted Regression. This literature review will explore existing studies to assist and evaluate current theories and practices to assess the impacts of new competitors on existing store performances.

2.1 Effects of International Expansion of Companies into Canada
As major markets continue to open up to international expansion, businesses and researchers alike try to understand two main by-products. The first by-product is the successes and failures of companies due to the competitiveness of the markets. The second by-product is the impacts on markets when a company successfully expands into international markets. With regards to the successes and failures of companies' expansion, Walmart has been the focal point of many studies due to its success. According to Mun's research (2012), one of Walmart's main objectives was to have a significant presence when they expanded into the Canadian market. To do that, Walmart purchased 120 of 142 Woolco Discount stores in 1994 (Mun & Yazdanifard, 2012). Walmart also acquired 39 of the Zellers locations from Target when Target purchased the majority of Zeller locations in Canada (Canada Newswire, 2011). While Walmart succeeded in integrating itself into the Canadian market through purchasing stores from another retailer, Target did not have the same success using a similar method. Target attempted to enter the Canadian market by purchasing 146 of 277 Zellers locations (CTC Competitor Database, 2017). It was found that while Target had succeeded in securing a large network of stores, it failed to obtain a larger market share than Zellers had previously in the same markets. When Target had decided to exit the Canadian market, Canadian Tire, Lowes, and Walmart each selected Target locations to obtain (See Table 1). The remaining locations were either returned to the landlord or sold on a case-by-case situation.

Table 1. Summary of Target locations acquired by each major retailer

With Target's failure to embed itself within the Canadian market, it is important to understand other approaches taken by companies. According to Dawson et al. (2006), department stores such as Walmart or Target, have a large enough variety of products, it is easier for them to enter a larger quantity of markets. This is due to department stores being able to revise their inventory based on the needs of the customers (Dawson et. al., 2006). While department stores have the ability to stock various products based on customer needs, specialty retailers are not able to adapt in the same way. This, in turn, means that their expansion into new markets is predominantly slower than that of department stores (Dawson et. al., 2006). Home Depot and Lowes, who are specializing home improvement/Do It Yourself (DIY) projects, are two examples in which companies slowly enter the market. Home Depot entered the Canadian market in 1994 by acquiring Aikenhead's Home Improvement Warehouse, which consisted of five locations (History, 2017). Currently, Home Depot operates 182 stores within ten provinces in Canada (History, 2017). This means that Home Depot expands its store network by approximately 8 locations per year. Like Home Depot, Lowes entered the Canadian market by opening stores in Brantford, Brampton, and Hamilton in

Page |6

December of 2007 (CTC Competitor Database, 2017). Lowes' plan was to select a few store locations that appeared to have high market potential rather than purchasing a large store network from another company. This was done to avoid the risk and cost associated with purchasing a store network that may have poor site selection, such as Target purchasing Zellers locations. Up until 2016, Lowes had slowly increased its network to 51 locations. This was a slow expansion to ensure that the integration into the Canadian market was successful. In May of 2016, Lowes announced that it would be acquiring RONA Inc., which currently has a store network of 539 locations (Lowes, 2017). This acquisition is continuously being monitored and assessed due to Lowes acquiring a large specialized retailer in a foreign market. While Lowes has only recently acquired Rona Inc., Walmart has effectively embedded itself within various international markets, such as Canada and Mexico, making it the focal point of many studies regarding the international expansion's effects on a market. According to Clarks (2000) and Kumar and Karanda (2000), Walmart's Supercentre format, which includes a grocery department, has an advantage over the majority of other grocery stores due to its convenience of a one-stop shop, low-cost, and is open 24-hours. Because of this success, Walmart has switched its focus to building Supercentres and updating older Walmarts to the Supercentre format. Since 2013, Walmart has built 35 stores, 29 of which were Supercentre format (CTC Competitor Database, 2017). This has led to many businesses struggling to maintain a profitable market share due to a combination of trying to compete with low prices, only selling a limited range of products and

Page |7

hours of operation. For businesses to compete with having to lower prices, businesses must make the decision to have less of a profit margin on each item. The second factor of only selling a limited range of products has led to stores expanding their products or locating within shopping centers, to appeal to customers who require items from various retail departments, such as plumbing, automotive, or sporting goods (Clark, 2000). The final factor of hours of operation has led to businesses requiring hiring more staff to compete with big box operation hours. All of the factors have led to many businesses to close. According to Clark (2000), these factors have more of an effect on retailers with a smaller store network than retailers who are more established. This is due to limitations such as smaller retailers not being able to purchase products in large enough quantities to obtain the same discounts per unit or not having the finances to hire more employees to stay open later.

2.2 Assessing the Factors Impacting Market Share
To accurately interpret and predict the effects of competitive retail facilities, the attractiveness of a retail facility must be measured and implemented into a given model (Drezner & Drezner, 2002). These models can include trade area estimation, market share, site selection, or assessing impacts on new competitors. According to Drezner et al. (2002), an interrelationship exists between in an area of four factors, one dependent variable, and three independent variables. The dependent variable is market share, which is a unit of measurement derived sales figures of competing for retail facilities within an area. The first independent variable is the buying power of an area. The second independent variable is the cost (usually
Page |8

measured in distance or time) between customers and retail facilities. The final independent variable is the attractiveness of retail facilities. The buying power of an area, more commonly referred to as market potential, is the "[Amount of money] dedicated to purchases in a specific type of retail facilities" (Drezner & Drezner, 2002). Due to most retail companies not releasing sales figures, competing companies and researchers alike attempt to use a combination of datasets and variables to infer the market potential of an area. Some of the common datasets used to determine the market potential are Census data, DemoStats, and CensusPlus, which include variables about income, expenditure, and household characteristics. To increase the granularity of assessing market potential, and subsequent market share(s), areas are divided into smaller zones. These zones include but are not limited to cities, CMA (Census Metropolitan Areas), FSALDU (more commonly known as Postal Codes), or DA (Dissemination Areas) which are determined by Statistics Canada. All subsequent data, such as census data and third party datasets, are aligned with these areas. To accurately assess costs such as distance or time in a retail environment, it is important to utilize a road network as well a public transportation systems, such as subway tracks, rather than straight line distance (Dolega et al., 2016). This is due retail customers requiring a mode of transportation to shop; this does not include online shopping if the company delivers to customer's homes. The attractiveness of a location includes but is not limited to size, products offered, and if it has other retailers within easy access (such as a mall or plaza). According to Hollander

Page |9

(2002), the option for one-stop shopping, such as a mall or plaza can significantly impact a customer's decision in where to shop for a given item. Another method for retailers to make their location more appealing, companies will make an agreement with other retailers, who are not direct competitors to open up location. Some examples of this are home Depot locations having a Harvey's location within the store or Lowe's locations having a Country Style location within or on its property.

2.3 Defining Trade Delineation
When determining the boundaries of a trade area, there are a few methods which can be implemented. According to Lea (1998), a retail trade area is defined as "[An] area, typically around the store, from which the store derives most of its patronage." Early work by Huff (1963) outlined defining retail trade areas by "(1) dividing the surrounding area into small statistical units; (2) calculating the probability of consumers from each of these units going to a particular shop-ping center; and (3) drawing lines around all statistical units having like probabilities." Popular techniques for creating trade area include Simple Rings, Hand Drawn Areas, Drive-time Areas, Hand-drawn areas, Non-overlapping Rings, Threshold Areas, Customer Derived Areas, and utilization of a Huff Model. The most simplistic and widely used method is the Simple Rings Method, which a simple radius is created around a store based on a Euclidean (Straight Line) Distance. Drive Areas are similar to a Simple Rings Method however it utilizes a road network rather than a straight line distance. Distance is also regularly substituted for time as many researchers have determined that the time it takes to get to a location can be more of

P a g e | 10

a determining factor than the distance to the location. Threshold Areas are areas that are created by continuously expanding the radius or drive areas until a specified limit is met. Customer Derived Areas are comprised of a primary, secondary, and tertiary markets which capture 30 percent, 50 percent, and 70 percent respectively of a variable. Flater (2012) defined the Huff Model as "A spatial interaction model that calculates gravity-based probabilities of consumers at each origin location patronizing each store in the store dataset." The Huff Model, unlike the other techniques, utilizes multiple variables, such as sales, store size, and distance to determine the trade area.

2.4 Geographic Weighted Regression
To quantify various relationships that exist between different variables, researchers have developed various mathematical models. One of the most commonly used models is a regression model when researchers are attempting to estimate the effects of independent variables on the dependent variable (Brundson, Charlton, and Fotheringham, 2006). OLS (Ordinary Least Square) is a linear modeling technique that is used to estimate regression model at a global level, and due to its simplicity, OLS is one of the most utilized techniques (Dismuke and Lindrooth, 2006). In many cases, however, OLS is misused for local analysis and can, therefore, be misleading based on the findings (Chumney, 2006). One technique that has become more regularly used for local modeling is GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) (Brunsdon, Fotheringham, and Charlton, 2003). With many researchers in various fields recognizing the importance of local modeling and the inclusion of weighting utilizing spatial component(s), GWR has been regarded as being more reliable and accurate when determining

P a g e | 11

the spatial relationships of variables (Zhang et al., 2004). Research surrounding Health and Disease (Hu et. al., 2012), Criminology (Brunsdon, et. al., 2003), Environmental (Harris et. al, 2010) and Economic Growth (Öcal and Yildirim, 2010) have started regularly relying on GWR to interpret the spatial relationship of various factors.

Study Area
The study areas were chosen based on three requirements. The first requirement was

that the store did not have any renovations done to the store after 2012. This was done to ensure that expansion, relocation, or renovation did not influence the change in sales of a store. The second requirement is that the store must have one competitor that has opened within the trade area between 2013 and 2015. This requirement is to ensure that the sales data that is being analyzed has had time to adjust to the new competitor within the market. To accurately assess, sales from one fiscal year prior and one year after the competitor opened The final requirement is that adjacent stores have not been renovated, relocated, expanded, or built between 2013 and 2015. This is to ensure that no sales data was being influenced by a store within its network. Based on these requirements, two stores, in Markham, Ontario and Medicine Hat, Alberta were chosen. According to Vaz and Arsanjani (2015), the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area is continuously expanding its urban land use and, subsequently, there is rapid economic growth. Because of this, the focus stores in Markham, Ontario and Medicine Hat, Alberta must be analyzed separately as the markets themselves are too different to be considered comparable.

P a g e | 12

3.1 Markham Study Area
The first store that was analysed is located in Markham, Ontario which has a population of over 353,000 and covers 212 square kilometres (City of Markham, 2014). According to Statistics Canada, Markham had a population growth of 15.3% between 2006 and 2011. This growth rate is significantly higher than the national average of 5.9% within the same years (Statistics Canada, 2011). The Part Source store that was selected as the focus store for this area is located at 8675 McCowan Road in Markham. The store opened in December of 2008 and is approximately 9,000 square feet (CTC, 2017). Based on Census Subdivision boundaries, this store is considered to be the only Part Source store in the market. Based on trade areas however, the Markham store's trade area is bordering the trade area of a Part Source store in Scarborough which is located at 2650 Lawrence Ave. East. The location in Scarborough has not been altered since it was built in 2004. Figure 1 shows both the Part Source stores in Markham and Scarborough.

The competitor that was analyzed was the Princess Auto which is located at 8500 Woodbine Ave in Markham. The store is approximately 38,000 square feet and opened in February of 2015 (CTC, 2017). This Princess Auto location is approximately 7 km away from the focus store (See Figure 2).

3.2 Medicine Hat Study Area
The second store that was analyzed is located in Medicine Hat, Alberta which covers approximately 112 square kilometres within its municipal boundary (City of Medicine Hat, 2012). According to Statistics Canada, Medicine Hat currently has a population of approximately 65,000 and a population growth of 5.3% (2017). The store that will be the Part Source store to be focused on is located at 310 Division Avenue SW. The store is approximately 12,000 square feet and opened in September of 2009 (CTC, 2017). Based on Census Divisions, this store is the only Part Source location within

Table 3. Summary of automotive retailers in Canada by province

While other businesses such as Walmart or Costco sell automotive products, these retailers do not have a primary focus on automotive products, and therefore were excluded from this study. Canadian Tire will also be excluded as it is Part Source's parent company, and accumulate sales from Canadian Tire locations via the sales of parts. Postal Code, road network, and FSA boundary shapefiles were acquired from Stats Canada. The Part Source locations, their associated information, and sales data were provided by CTC.

Sales data is collected by a combination of staff manually at the POS (Point of Sales) system and utilizing customers who have an account. In the case of customers who have an account, the postal codes associated with each account are rarely inaccurate as the account is regularly updated. It should be noted that Canadian Tires have accounts with Part Source but the sales associated with any Canadian Tire store have been removed. This was done due to the market share provided by Canadian Tire stores will not be impacted by a competitor of Part Source entering a market because of Part Source being a banner under the CTC. In the case of
P a g e | 19

customers' postal codes being manually entered; there is a greater chance of there being an error while it is being entered. This includes, but is not limited to, postal codes not being entered, being entered incorrectly, or a postal code such as the stores postal code or a random valid postal code (e.g. "A0A0A0") are entered in place of the customer's postal code. In order to correct for the not entered and some incorrectly entered postal codes, a SQL (Structured Query Language) query was created to confirm that all postal codes that remained in the table were found in the list of postal codes from Statistics Canada (See Appendix). In the case of random postal codes being entered, the amount of misrepresented postal codes can be reduce by putting a restriction such as postal codes having to be within 1000 kilometres of a store. While this type of restriction is applied when looking at the entire network of sales, the stores chosen for this study did not require one. In the case of the store postal code being entered, this is a limitation of the data as the stores that were chosen to be used for this study are not self-contained within their own respected postal code. Once all records that did not have a valid associated Postal Code were removed, the remaining sales data was then grown out to represent each store's total sales for each fiscal year. The following equation was utilized to grow out the sales: DSAPC = Distributed Sales Amount per Postal Code ASAPC = Actual Sales Amount per Postal Code TSSM = Total Store Sales per Month TVPCSM = Total Valid Postal Code Sales per Month

Due to the data transformations requiring to be subdivided, a python script was developed to ensure efficiency (See Appendix).

4.1.2 Creating Dominant Sales Layer
In order to reduce both the amount of time and limit the amount of memory required to generate each trade area, a secondary table was created. This table consists of unique postal codes with an associated store that has the highest sales within that postal code. This was done by creating a python script to rank store sales by postal code, create and populate dominant sales tables, and create dominant sales shapefiles for each fiscal year (See Appendix). It should be noted that while postal codes are being utilized for the analysis, postal codes were reduced to the FSA level to ensure that sensitive data was not released.

4.2

Creating Trade Areas

For this analysis, a threshold area methodology will be utilized, and the boundaries will be FSA rather than FSALDU. This was done to ensure that sensitive data was not released. The dominant sales layer will then be joined to FSA layer, and each store will be assigned the FSA in which it falls within. While many stores may fall within an FSA in which the sales are dominant to that store, the area may not consist of only businesses, therefore, sales would not be associated to that FSA. Once each store has been assigned to the FSA that it falls within, the surrounding FSA boundaries are then analyzed and added to the trade area if the sales are
P a g e | 21

dominant to the store that the trade area is being built for. This process continues until new FSA boundaries are no longer being added to the trade area. Once the trade area is determined, all FSA boundaries that are contained within the trade area but not assigned to the trade area will be assigned to the trade area. In order to ensure that trade areas aren't limited due to boundaries such as rivers, digital boundaries will be utilized.

4.3

Determining Competitors within Trade Areas
Competitors were subdivided into stores that opened since 2013 and other. The stores

that opened since 2013 were then associated with the trade area in which it falls within. While new competitors can affect multiple locations, for the purpose of this study, new competitor's effects will only be analyzed for the store which is most likely to impact. The purpose of the contiguous trade areas were to ensure that competitors that fell within the trade area were properly identified.

4.4

Geographic Weighted Regression
According to Drezner et al. (2002), an interrelationship exists between the market share,

market potential, cost of traveling to the site, and attractiveness of the site. In this analysis, the market share is represented by the subtracting the percent of sales per each postal code in 2016 from the percent of sales per each postal code in 2014. Market potential was calculated using the expenditure data while the cost was represented by the distance to the competitor or store. For the purpose of this study, the attractiveness was represented by the total vehicles in operation (TVIO) data derived at the postal code level. The TVIO data was chosen as both the

P a g e | 22

Part Source and Princess Auto can be more or less attractive based on the parts in which they regularly stock. A store that stocks more parts, such as batteries or headlight bulbs, for a specific customer's vehicle is considered to be more attractive than a store that does not. In order to understand how these factors are related, a geographic weighted regression (GWR) was utilized. A GWR is considered to be an extension of an ordinary least square (OLS) (Gao and Li, 2011). Charlton and Fotheringham (2011) define the simplest form of linear regression model as:

 = 0 + 1  +  for =1 ... 

represented by  ,  represents the error term, and 0 and 1 are the parameters.

where  represents the dependent variable located at  , the independent variable is Research has shown that findings can be misleading when an OLS is utilized for a local

analysis (Chumney, 2006). A GWR has the ability to perform a local analysis with greater precision than that of an OLS (Dismuke and Lindrooth, 2006). A GWR was chosen due to this analysis requiring a more local approach. Lu et. al, (2016) define a geographic weighted regression as:

goodness of fit of the model. The R2 value has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1.

Results and Discussion
The two focus stores, located in Markham, Ontario and Medicine Hat, Alberta, will be

assessed separately and compared due to two key differences in their markets. The first key difference is that Markham, Ontario has a population density of approximately 1,665 people per square kilometre while Medicine hat, Albert has a population density of 580 people per square kilometre. The second key difference is the markets that surround the focus market. Based on Census Subdivision boundaries, Markham is shares its borders with five other Census Subdivisions totaling a population of approximately 3.5 million (See Table 4).

This means that these stores are utilized more effectively if they are treated as separate entities and contrasted rather than building one model to represent the changes in sales data for both stores. Before analyzing changes within each specific postal code, there are a few key pieces of information which should be addressed. This information includes the opening date of competitor, sales data that will be utilized and the transiency of sales. For the purpose of this study, transient sales are defined as all sales that fall outside of the trade area boundaries for the focus store. The competitor in each of the focus stores` trade areas, the competitor`s grand

P a g e | 25

opening date was in 2015; based on Part Source`s fiscal calendar dates. Because of this, sales from Part Sources fiscal 2014 and 2016 years will be utilized. The transient sales for the store in Markham were calculated to be approximately 0.8% in 2014 and increased to approximately 8.8% in 2016. The store in Medicine Hat had approximately 4.7% transient sales in 2014 and approximately 5.4% transient sales in 2016. The difference in total area covered by each trade area is the primary factor to explain the additional 7.3% increase in transient sales that Markham had compared to Medicine Hat between 2014 and 2016.

5.1 Initial Assessment and Statistics of Competitor Impacts

In order to ensure that trade areas cannot be further derived from the FSA level, all subsequent analyses will only include postal codes which had sales present in both 2014 and 2016. The table below outlines the statistics of postal codes which were included within the study.
2014 % of Sales 59.0% 74.0% 2016 % of Postal Codes With % of Sales Sales 75.0% 63.6% 50.0% 72.5% % of Postal Codes With Sales 36.0% 6.9%

5.1.1 Medicine Hat, Alberta
In the case of the store in Medicine Hat, Alberta, the highest negative change in sales between 2014 and 2016 was approximately -3.8% and the highest positive change in sales within the same years was approximately 29.2%. The average change in sales was -0.003% and the median change was 0.001%.

Figure 6. Map of the change in sales between 2014 and 2016 in Medicine Hat

Due to the size of the sample of changes in sales for this focus store, there were a few spatial patterns that were observed. With regards to postal codes within the Census Subdivision boundaries it was observed that sales remain relatively unchanged with the exception of postal

P a g e | 27

codes surrounding the new competitor. These postal codes had a positive increase of 12.5 percent of total sales within each of these postal codes. Due to this phenomenon, further analyses were conducted utilizing the distance to the competitor and contrasting the findings against the same analyses utilizing distance to the focus store. In the case of distances from the competitor to surrounding postal codes with sales data, it was found that the sales from postal codes closer to the competitor represented more of the stores total sales after the competitor opened than they had prior. While postal codes closer to the competitor were increased once the competitor opened, postal codes represented less the further away they were from the competitor.

Unlike the analysis above, the distance from Part Source to postal codes with associated changes in sales did not follow the same spatial patterns. Sales within five kilometres and greater than 20 kilometres were found to represent fewer sales after the competitor opened while sales between 10 and 20 kilometers represented a larger percent of sales.

5.1.2 Markham, Ontario
In the case of the store in Markham, Ontario the highest negative change in sales between 2014 and 2016 was approximately -5.1 percent and the highest positive change in sales within the same years was approximately 22.7 percent. The average and median change in sales were both positive and were 0.4 percent and 0.3 percent respectively.

Due to the limitations of the data available for analysis, the initial visual inspection does not have any spatial patterns that are easily identified. Like the analysis for Medicine Hat, the following analysis was conducted initially using distance from postal codes to competitor and then was redone using the distance from postal codes to the focus store. Along with the visual inspection being limited due to the data available, the data available does not allow for the same distance breaks to be utilized for both of these analyses. Because of this, natural breaks in the distance calculated for each of the postal code to the competitor or focus store were utilized.

P a g e | 30

In the case of the distance from postal codes with sales data to the Princess Auto, it was found that the further away the postal codes were, the more they positively increased. The closer the postal codes were to the Princess Auto, the more the sales negatively increased. The table below is based on natural breaks within the data.

Unlike the focus store in Medicine Hat, utilization of the distance from postal code to the Part Source location produced a similar trend to the analysis above. Postal codes that are close to the Part Source had a negative increase in represented sales. As the distance increased, the represented sales positively increased as well.

5.2 Determining Factors of the effect of Competitors
In order to further understand the effects of a competitor influencing postal code sales, it is important to understand what factors are correlated. To ensure that the variables that are selected have a clear reason for being selected, the correlation between the change in sales represented by each postal code, the cost to the customer to the competitor or the focus stores, the attractiveness of a store and the market potential must be understood. While the cost is determined by the drive distance to a location, the attractiveness and market potential will be determined through expenditure data and Total Vehicles In Operation (TVIO) data. The three expenditure variables that were selected were; "Accessories for automobiles, vans and trucks", "tires, batteries, and other parts and supplies for vehicles", and "Maintenance and repairs of vehicles". The TVIO data has been divided into domestic and import, sedan or pickup, and the year the vehicle was manufactured; based on five year intervals. Each of these variables will be modeled and compared. All models that are created for the subsequent analyses of the markets in Medicine Hat and Markham will be geographic weighted regression models. The interpretation column was determined based on the difference between the minimum and maximum adjusted R2 values and divided based on equal breaks into five classifications; Very Weak (less than 0.313), Weak (0.314 ­ 0.466), Moderate (0.467 ­ 0.619), Strong (0.62 ­ 0.772), and Very Strong (greater than 0.723).

Conclusion 6.1 Findings
Based on each of the competitor that opened in relation to the drive distance a given

postal code, the initial findings were that the Princess Auto that opened in Medicine Hat, Alberta had increased sales between 2014 and 2016 within 5 km of the Princess Auto. As

P a g e | 39

further away postal codes with a change in sales between 2014 and 2016 are analyzed, the sales are reduced and become negative. This is the opposite effect that the Princess Auto that opened in Markham, Ontario had. Postal codes with associated sales data that are close to this Princess Auto were more likely to be negative than postal codes that were further away. Based on each of the focus stores in relation to the drive distance a given postal code, the initial findings were that the Princess Auto that opened in Medicine Hat, Alberta had less of a linear change in sales compared to the competitor focused analysis. Within five kilometres, sales were found to have had a slightly negative change between 2014 and 2016. Between five and 10 kilometres, sales had a positive change between 2014 and 2016. Sales greater than 10 kilometres, had a negative change between 2014 and 2016. While the focus store in Medicine Hat, Alberta had a different spatial pattern than that of its competitor, the focus store in Markham, Ontario had fundamentally the same results as the competitor within its market. Based on the analyses that had a spatial linear pattern, the differences in the two markets can be explained by the size of the trade area. The trade area that was generated for Medicine Hat, which covered approximately 119,628 square kilometres, was significantly larger than the trade area that was generated for Markham, Ontario which covered approximately 101 square kilometres. The geographic weighted regression models that were created for each of the TVIO data allowed for an understanding about which vehicles within the market were most correlated with the positive or negative change in sales. In the case of Medicine Hat, Alberta, Imported Trucks built from 1986 to 1990 and 2006 to 2015 and both domestic and import cars built from

P a g e | 40

2011 to 2015 were the top five categories with the highest correlation. Unlike imported trucks and new cars being the highest correlated categories with the sales changes, the focus store's changes in sales in Markham, Ontario had the highest correlation with domestic cars built from 1996 to 2005 and domestic trucks built from 1996 to 2010.

6.2 Limitations
While the findings outline above allowed for understanding and modeling the impacts of new competitors, it is important to understand the limitations of the data as well. The first limitation was the sales data. The sales data that was utilized was a sample of the data collected by a combination of staff manually at the POS (Point of Sales) system and utilizing customers who have an account. As outlined in section 4.1.1 Sales Data Validation, the most common problems that occur are postal codes not being entered, being entered incorrectly, or a postal code such as the stores postal code or a random valid postal code "A0A0A0" are entered in place of the customer's postal code. Along with these limitations, there is also the limitation of the data being a sample size of the total store sales. This means that there are potential postal codes that should have sales associated with them. This limits the amount of postal codes that were analyzed and the postal codes that were analyzed had the potential to be an inaccurate representation of sales associated with each postal code. The next limitation is the FSA boundaries that were utilized when the trade areas were created. While these boundary files were advantageous in ensuring that more competitors were captured within a trade area, it also increased the probability that trade areas would intersect each other. A few potential focus stores were excluded due to the requirement that

P a g e | 41

all trade areas that intersect with the focus store's trade area are not representative of stores that have been renovated, relocated, expanded, or built from 2013 and 2015. Along with the trade areas limiting potential study areas, the competitor data that was used within the study only had 1.3% of the records with opening dates. Due to this, both focus stores were analyzed based on a Princess Auto opening. This means that the findings within this study may only be applicable to Princess Auto in relation to Part Source rather than automotive competitors in general. The final limitation was the TVIO data which was derived from data at the dissemination area level. Because of this, the data had been evenly distributed based on number of households in each postal code. While there was no analysis done to calculate how this skewed the results, it was determined that this had an impact on the analysis.

6.3 Future Research
Any future research that is conducted should attempt to minimize or eliminate all the limitations that were stated above and conduct the methodology of the study again. With this in mind, there are a few recommended approaches for future research. The first is to transform the sales data to the dissemination area level and rerun the trade area methodology. This will limit the size of the trade area, which will be less likely to intersect with other trade areas and allow for the TVIO data to be analyzed without having to be transformed. While the sales data will become less accurate, it is believed that the increase in accuracy of the TVIO data will outweigh the increased inaccuracy of the sales data at the dissemination area level. The next is

to purchase or conduct a more thorough sweep of various media outlets to increase the amount of competitor records that have opening dates. This study and the addition of the recommendations above can be useful in many different retail applications. To start, Part Source could utilize this information to help better predict the impact of a competitor and could attempt to mitigate the effects of a new competitor by creating a promotion that targets specific customers. An example of this would be if the store in Markham, Ontario had a promotion of 10% off parts to all customers that own a vehicle that was built from 1996 to 2010. Another example would be if the store in Medicine Hat, Alberta had a promotion of 10% off parts to all customers that own an import vehicle. In both scenarios, the targeted customers would be less likely to go to the new Princess Auto. While Part Source could utilize this information to interpret and take precautions to minimize the effects of a new competitor, the same competitors can utilize this information to understand which markets have the potential to be more or less difficult to enter. An example of this would be if Princess Auto ensured that they have parts for import truck and car are always in stock in their store in Medicine Hat, Alberta to maximize the amount of sales captured from Part Source sales. While this study specifically pertains to the effects of a new competitor on Part Source, the methodology can be applied and utilize by the majority of retailers. If Canadian Tire were to utilize the same methodology to determine the effects of a competitor, such as Walmart, opening up within a given market, the sales data could be subdivided based on department. This, in combination with a larger demographic dataset, could be used to develop a refined definition of which customers are most at risk to be effected by a new Walmart.

This methodology can also be applied to other sectors such as health or public safety. In the case of health, if a hospital were to be shut down then the effects could be measured using this methodology and substituting sales with a variable such as the count of patients with a specific health issue. In the case of public safety, if a new precinct were to be built, this methodology could be applied to understand both the general effects on crime and specific crimes being impacted. An example of this would be to substitute the sales variable for the number of cars that have been broken into. It is also important to note that while the python scripts were developed using the module "arcpy", which is only used for ArcMap software, the module is not unique and the scripts can be easily modified for use in software such as QGIS. The SQL queries are able to be used with modifications to the column names. In both cases, the advantage to develop custom programs in an open source language is that it can be easily adopted across platforms. This is advantageous in situations where refined methodologies must be preserved during a change such as a company switching software due to budget cuts.
