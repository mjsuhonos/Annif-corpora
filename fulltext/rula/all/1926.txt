ABSTRACT ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF HEAVY METALS IN TORONTO Muhammad Yousaf Master of Science, Molecular Science, Ryerson University, 2012

Atmospheric deposition rates of heavy metals (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were determined from July 2009-December 2010 in downtown Toronto. Atmospheric deposition samples were collected using samplers with plastic, glass and water surfaces from two rooftops (15 m and 59 m above ground) in the city core of Toronto. Mercury species were analyzed using Cold Vapor Atomic Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (CVAFS) and the rest of metals were analyzed by acid digestion combined with Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). The results showed that the deposition of heavy metals was higher on water surface as compared to both the plastic and glass surfaces and that Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn showed higher deposition rates as compared to As, Cd, Co and Ni. The deposition rates were higher on Kerr Hall North (KHN) site indicating contribution from local sources. For total mercury (THg) and methyl mercury (MeHg), the deposition rates were higher on Jorgenson (JOR) site as compared to KHN site.

1. 1.1.

Introduction Definition of heavy metals The term "heavy metals" has been defined in different ways over the years. It has been

defined on the basis of density, specific gravity, atomic weight, atomic number, toxicity etc. (Duffus, 2002). It is often used as a group name for metals and metalloids that have been associated with contamination and potential toxicity or ecotoxicity (Duffus, 2002). It is a term generally used for metallic elements having higher atomic weight and associated with toxicity (Draghici et al. 2011). Trace elements, microelements, and trace metals are some other commonly used terms for heavy metals (Adriano, 2001).

1.2.

Heavy metals in the atmosphere Heavy metals exist naturally in the Earth's crust at low concentration, generally less than

100 ppm. Minerals are important geological sources of heavy metals (Vladimir, 2002). They are transported out of soil through a number of processes like plant biomass removal and erosion/leaching (Schründer-Lenzen, 2007). They are also released into the environment by many human activities. The release of heavy metals to the environment starts at the beginning of the production chain (whenever ores are mined), continues during the use of products containing them, and also occurs at the end of the production chain (Bradl, 2005). Heavy metals are carried in the atmosphere as gases, aerosols, and particulates (Bradl, 2005). Sources of heavy metals are mineral dusts, sea salt particles, extraterrestrial matter,
1

volcanic aerosols, forest fires, and industrial sources such as emissions from transportation, coal combustion, and fugitive particulate (particulate matter produced by activities such as construction projects, demolition, road repairs and) emission (Kouimtzis and Samara, 1995). The substances released into the air are spread and affect humans, animals, and plants. The pollutants are released at the point sources and are then transported by prevailing air currents. During transportation, they can become associated with precipitation or transformed into different forms by chemical reactions.. Heavy metals that are volatile or those attached to air-borne particles can be dispersed throughout the atmosphere, often thousands miles away from the site of initial release (Rashad and Shalaby, 2007).

1.3.

Anthropogenic sources of heavy metals Human activities have drastically altered the biogeochemical cycles and balance of heavy

metals in the environment. Where natural sources are dominated by parent rocks and metallic minerals, the principal man-made sources of heavy metals are agricultural activities, as fertilizers, animal manures, and pesticides containing heavy metals are widely used, industrial point sources (e.g., mines, foundries and smelters), diffuse sources such as combustion byproduct (Mohaupt et al., 2001), vehicle emissions (Davis et al., 2011), microelectronic products, and solid waste disposal. Public electricity and heating plus residential sectors have also been found as major contributors towards the emission of heavy metals (EMEP Status Report 2/2005). Table 1 shows some of the common uses of heavy metals by which they can be introduced into the environment.

Factors affecting the distribution of heavy metals in the atmosphere Different studies have determined different concentrations of the heavy metals in the

atmosphere. The reason for this is the variety of factors that influence the levels of heavy metals. These factors can be the height of sampler above ground, distance from the source, distance from building, type of sampler, wind speed, wind direction, air stability, temperature, season, traffic volume, sampling period etc. (Fergusson, 1990; Ali et al., 1986; Morselli et al., 2003; Davis et al., 2011; Hovmand et al., 2008). Sampling media can be another factor. In recent years, studies have been conducted on moss plant (Aboal et al., 2010), spinach (Sharma et al., 2008), crops and vegetables (Pandey et al., 2009; Azimi et al., 2004). Some of the factors can be controlled by the experiment, e.g. the sampling equipment/position of sampler, but some are outside the control of the experiment, e.g. the weather. Some of the main factors are explained below. 1) Winds: Wind speed and wind direction are important factors in determining the atmospheric levels of heavy metals as wind promotes the dilution and dispersal of air pollutants. The low concentration because of the wind does not mean that the element is not being emitted from the source but rather it is more rapidly dispersed and diluted (Simmonds et al., 1983). 2) Sampling factors: A number of sampling factors influence the observed levels of the heavy metals. Some of these factors are the length of the sampling time, direction of the wind with respect to the sampler, the distance from the source etc. 3) The climate in cities: The climate within cities can be different to surrounding rural areas, and is influenced by the terrain, i.e. buildings, high energy consumption and subsequent loss to the atmosphere, and reflecting surfaces. The reduced wind speed, loss of heat to the atmosphere at night from surfaces, which are good heat conductors, provide conditions that trap pollutants.

4

In addition cities become heat islands and air circulates within them which help to keep the material within the city (Fergusson, 1990). 4) Vehicle emission: The concentration of heavy metals in air is related to the traffic volume. Higher levels of heavy metals were observed along highways and roads of higher traffic density (Davis et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2008). This could be because of the fact that the gasoline additives, used to increase the gasoline's octane rating, often are formulated with heavy metals. Those metal-containing additives mainly refer to antiknock agents such as tetraethyl lead (TEL), methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), ferrocene etc. Diesel vehicles can produce black soot [diesel particulate matter (DPM)] from their exhaust, which consists of unburned carbon compounds together with those impurities of heavy metals bound to the particulate matters (Wang et al., 2009). Also it has been shown that brake linings are a major source of metal emissions such as Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in urban areas (Bergback et al., 2001; Westerlund, 2001). Similar studies have reported that vehicle tires have been a great source of heavy metals such as Zn and Cd (Legret and Pagotto, 1999; Sorme and Lagerkvist, 2002). 5) Particle size and residence time: The size of particles plays an important role in the dispersion of pollutants from the source of their emission. The size of atmospheric particles ranges from 0.001 to 100 µm in diameter (Paulhamus, 1972; Brook et al., 2007; wang et al., 2006). Particles < 2 µm generally come from anthropogenic sources, whereas when they are above 2 µm, the main source is wind-blown and re-entrained dust. For a number of cities where anthropogenic sources dominate, the aerosol sizes mainly span 0.12-0.7 µm, of which 20-25% lies at the lower end of the range (Nriagu, 1978; Health Canada, 2007). The lifetime of aerosols in the air, which contain heavy metals, is a function of the particle size. The smallest particles, 0.001-0.08 µm, have a lifetime of <1 hour, because of
5

coagulation into bigger particles, whereas in the accumulation range, 0.08-1.0 µm, the life time is 4-40 days and the large particles >1.0 µm have a life time of minutes to days (Graedel, 1980; Power, 2003; Rasch et al., 2008; Deschler, 2008). Because of the long residence times of small particles, transport of particulate material in the atmosphere can extend over long distances e.g. 100 to 1000 km (Fergusson, 1990; Kellos et al., 2007; Turner, 2007).

1.5.

Pathways of heavy metal access In order to cause an effect in a living organism, heavy metals have to come into contact

with this organism. This might happen through the following three principal ways. Inhalation: Heavy metals can enter the organisms by respiration. Heavy metals, being volatile and particulate, are released into the atmosphere in large quantities (Pacyna and Keeler, 1995). Respiration of metal pollution through dust is one of the most serious threats to humans working in industrial workplaces. They may cause a variety of damage including cancer, liver and kidney diseases, neurological damage, cardiovascular toxicity and anemia (Siegel, 2002). Ingestion: The second pathway of entering organisms is through ingestion (water + food). Water contaminated with heavy metals can be ingested directly by drinking or indirectly by using this water for cooking and irrigation. Heavy metals can be introduced into the body by ingestion of foods with high contents of heavy metals. This could be through plant uptake. If soil contains a high metal content, this will result in polluted food crops and animal forage (Bradl, 2005; Brown and Welton, 2008). Absorption: Absorption through the skin could be another path for the heavy metals access to the living organism. Although heavy metals uptake through absorption is minimal when compared to

6

ingestion and inhalation, even then it contributes towards the heavy metals budget in the living organisms (Brown and Welton, 2008).

1.6.

Toxicity of the heavy metals Heavy metals being non-biodegradable, have long term impact on food safety which

requires immediate remedition strategies (Lim et al., 2005). As levels of heavy metals rise in the air, water, and topsoil, they also rise within our bodies, contributing to chronic diseases, learning disorders, cancer, dementia, and premature aging. For example heavy metals poison humans by disrupting cellular enzymes, which run on nutritional minerals such as magnesium, zinc, and selenium (Lindquivist, 1995). Some of the heavy metals are required by the human body in minute quantities e.g. Co and Zn to run different functions but when their concentrations exceed a certain limit in the body, they become toxic. Some other metals like Cd, Pb, Hg have no known functions in the human body. Once they enter the body, they cannot be degraded into a harmless product and they are accumulated to a level where they become toxic and sometimes fatal to living organisms. Studies have shown that metals like As, Cd, Ni and Hg are human genotoxic carcinogens and that there is no identifiable threshold below which these substances do not pose a risk to human health (Brown and Welton, 2008). Table 2 shows some of the harmful effects due to the excessive concentration of heavy metals.

Table 2: Ecotoxicological effects of heavy metals through which they can be harmful to the living organisms. As Cd Well known for its suicidal and homicidal effects, neurological signs of toxicity, malfunctioning of liver, nasal cavity, lungs, skin, bladder, kidney, and prostate. Toxic to plants and invertebrates. It causes plant root growth retardation, damage to internal and external root structure, reduction of chlorophyll content. In humans, it causes bone degeneration (osteoporosis), neurological disorder, irritation of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, kidney damage, abnormalities of the skeletal system and cancer of lungs and prostate. Soil with high Co concentration usually also have high As and Ni concentrations and these elements are generally more toxic to plants and animals. Chronic effects of copper exposure can damage the liver and kidneys. Its excessive concentration can cause vomiting, hematemesis, gastrointestinal distress, hemolytic anemia. Manganese toxicity may result in multiple neurologic problems. Unlike ingested manganese, inhaled manganese is transported directly to the brain before it can be metabolized in the liver. It can be toxic to the respiratory and reproductive tract and damage the liver. It shows some psychiatric symptoms, such as irritability, aggressiveness and even hallucinations. Ni components like Ni(CO)4, Ni3S2, NiO and Ni2O3 leads to pneumonitis with adrenal cortical insufficiency, pulmonary oedema, and hepatic degeneration, cancer of the respiratory tract due to chronic inhalation of nickel oxide, pulmonary eosinophilia, asthma, nasal and sinus problems. It can also cause skin rash. Pb poisoning includes general fatigue, tremors, headache, vomiting and seizures. Also it interferes with hemoglobin synthesis and damages kidney functions. It can damage internal organs, the brain and nervous system. Chronic exposure to Pb induces peripheral neuropathy accompanied by abdominal pain, constipation and microcytic anemia. High Zn intake may affect cholesterol metabolism. Zinc chloride fumes have caused injury to mucous membranes and pale grey cyanosis, metal fume fever, anemia, pancreas damage and lower levels HDL. Inhalation causes throat dryness, cough, aching, chills, fever, nausea and vomiting.

1.7.

Atmospheric deposition of heavy metals Atmospheric deposition is the transfer of pollutants from the atmosphere to the earth's

surface and generally occurs through rain and snow, falling particles, and absorption of the gas form of the pollutants into water (USEPA, 2011). This serves as a pathway for transporting heavy metals in biogeochemical cycles due to the anthropogenic activities in major cities, thereby increasing their concentrations in soil and water and consequently in the food chain (Sharma et al., 2008). In general, larger particles tend to settle to the ground by gravity within hours near the source of emission whereas the smaller particles stay in the atmosphere longer (weeks or months) and are spread to distant places, only to be removed by precipitation (Golubeva et al., 2010).

1.8.

A literature review on the atmospheric deposition A number of studies have been conducted on the atmospheric deposition of heavy metals

in the environment. Different studies have used different sampling techniques as well as the methods of analyzing the heavy metals. In a recent study done in Poland (Staszewski et al., 2012), contamination of 23 Polish national parks with heavy metals was studied. The result showed that parks located in the southern part of the country (Babiogrski, Magurski, Ojcowski and Gorczanski) were the most polluted with the heavy metals. It was likely due to the higher industrial activity in this part of Poland and the transboundary transport of air pollutants from the neighbouring countries. Another study was done on the atmospheric fall-out of heavy metals in the Cordoba province of Argentina (Bermudez et al., 2012). They took the topsoil and atmospheric fall-out samples from ten areas of the province to detect the concentration of metals in wheat grains. The
9

samples were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrometry. The deposition rates of As, Cu, Pb and Zn were found to be higher, which reflects both natural and anthropogenic sources. Industries and the transport of airborne urban pollutants were the main anthropogenic sources of heavy metals. A study that was done at two locations in the Castellon province Spain detected high concentrations of heavy metals in the settleable particulate matter. The most important source of atmospheric particulate present in both locations (Almazora and Vila-real) is associated with the presence of high industrial density (the manufacture of ceramic tiles and the activities derived from this, a petrochemical complex, power station and high traffic volume). Heavy metals in the soluble fraction of settleable air particles were analyzed by using ICP-MS. The soil samples were also analyzed by ICP-MS after microwave digestion. The results showed a high seasonal variability for heavy metal content and a strong dependence of the rainfall in the study area. The maximum concentrations of heavy metals were observed during the highest rainfall in spring (Soriano et al., 2012). A few studies were done to estimate the influence of local emissions to the sediment cores along the coastal line (Singhal et al., 2012) or in lake (Li et al., 2012) or river (Stoyanova et al., 2012) waters. They found higher concentrations of heavy metals in areas near industrial and agriculture activities or where there was an accumulation of heavy metals over time. A study was conducted on organic paddy fields to estimate the concentration of heavy metals present. The study was done in a low population density farming area where the deposition is only from natural sources. The results revealed a higher concentration of heavy metals which was due to the use of organic fertilizers and the detected heavy metals in the soil were matched with the constituents of the applied fertilizer (Su and Kao, 212).
10

A study on the spatial distribution of bulk atmospheric deposition of heavy metals was conducted in metropolitan Sydney, Australia, using high density polyethylene tanks (HDPE). The metals were analyzed using ICP-AES and the results showed that the deposition rates were temporally consistent, and they showed a strong correlation with road proximity and traffic volume, i.e. the deposition was found to be higher on the road sites with heavy traffic volume and vice versa (Davis et al., 2011). Another study (Aboal et al., 2010) described the estimation of atmospheric deposition of heavy metals by analyzing terrestrial moss plants. They concluded that the analysis of moss does provide useful information in regards to the presence of contaminants in the atmosphere. A study on the characterization of wet and dry atmospheric depositions have been carried out by Morselli et al., (2003), in order to evaluate the impact of airborne heavy metals on the pollution load in Bologna, an Italian northern urban area. Wet precipitation samples were filtered and heavy metal contents in soluble and insoluble fractions were determined. The same procedure was applied to the water samples which were collected by dry deposition. The percentage of the heavy metal soluble fraction in dry deposition was generally lower than in wet deposition. Cd, V, Cu and Zn showed a higher average solubility than Cr, Ni and Pb both in wet and dry deposition. Atmospheric heavy metal depositions have also been monitored in rural forest soils of southern Scandinavia. The results showed that the accumulated atmospheric inputs over 50 years played a dominant role in the buildup of heavy metals in the top soils of the forests providing between 50 and 90% of the estimated heavy metals increments (Hovmand et al., 2008). Rapid growth in urbanization and industrialization in developing countries can affect human health by contaminating vegetables with heavy metals through atmospheric deposition.

An assessment was made to investigate the spatial and seasonal variations in the deposition rates of heavy metals and its concentration to contamination of palak (Beta Vulgaris) in Varanasi, India. The results showed that the sampling locations near industrial or commercial areas with heavy traffic load showed significantly higher deposition rates of Cu, Zn and Cd as compared to those in the residential areas with low traffic load (Sharma et al., 2008). Other studies have also shown a relationship between atmospheric deposition and elevated elemental levels in crops and vegetables (Azimi et al., 2004; Pandey et al., 2009). Additional studies also describe that urban and peri-urban areas were the most contaminated with heavy metals (Polkowska et al., 2001; Khillare et al., 2004). Atmospheric deposition of heavy metals in central Ontario was studied over 30 years ago (Jeffries and Snyder, 1981), where the magnitude of atmospheric inputs of materials into lakes was studied at four different locations in the Muskoka-Haliburton and Sudbury regions. The results of the study showed a large temporal variations in the monthly deposition of all metals. Concentration and deposition of all metals in Muskoka-Haliburton were generally low whereas, in Sudbury, the large local smelting industry contributed to elevated Cu, Ni, Zn and Fe deposition. Calculation of an enrichment factor (normalized against Mn) showed that the levels of Pb, Cu, Ni and Zn require an additional non-crustal source (either natural or anthropogenic) for explanation. Two years later a study (Taylor and Crowder, 1983) confirmed elevated concentration of Cu and Ni near the smelters.

Study objectives Toronto is the biggest city in Canada and the downtown area is the site of more than 20

skyscrapers that are at least 150 m in height. Toronto is ranked the 5th among census subdivisions in the great Lakes basin for releasing toxic air pollutants (Pollution Watch Fact Sheet, 2008). Therefore, it is very important to study the atmospheric deposition of heavy metals in the city to understand the impact of local anthropogenic sources to the environment of the city. The first objective of the study was to identify and quantify heavy metals such as arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in atmospheric deposition samples. The second objective of the study was to compare the deposition rates of heavy metals on different surface types which have never been studied together. The surfaces used for this study include both dry (plastic and glass) and wet (water). Also, two different sites varying in height were selected to see how deposition varies with elevation which could insight to the sources contributing towards the heavy metals' concentrations which eventually are deposited on the surface.

Materials and Methods Sampling Locations The sampling took place on two rooftops at Ryerson University located in the downtown

core of Toronto (latitude, 43° 40' N and longitude, 79° 24' W): one (KHN) site having a height of ~15 m above ground and the other (JOR) having a height of ~59 m above ground (Figure 1). The city of Toronto has a population of 2.5 million and the four surrounding regional municipalities form the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) with over 5.6 million residents in a total area of 7,125 km2 (Statistics Canada, Census 2006). The rooftop locations, compared to a ground surface location, provide wider exposure to the atmosphere and better security for the samplers.

Development of Samplers In this study, atmospheric bulk deposition of heavy metals was studied on dry and wet

surfaces. Plastic and glass surfaces were used to estimate the deposition on dry surface whereas water was used as a wet surface. A plastic container (39.5 cm × 59.5 cm) filled with nano-pure
14

water (~ 1.5 L) served as the wet sampler whereas for the dry deposition collectors, plastic [polypropylene ­ a thermoplastic polymer made from the monomer propylene having a molecular formula (C3H6)n. Most commercial polypropylene is isotactic and has an intermediate level of crystallinity between that of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and has a melting point that ranges from 160 to 166 °C] and glass [highborosilicate glass also known as hard glass which mainly consists of silica and boron oxide. Borosilicate glass is known for being less dense than ordinary glass (soda-lime glass, often called "Soft Glass") and for having very low coefficients of thermal expansion, making it resistant to thermal shock, more so than any other common glass] sheets were housed in plastic containers of the same size as water container. The dry samplers had to be dry all the times in order to allow the heavy metals (particulate and gaseous) to deposit on the dry surface. For this purpose the glass sampler (placed in a container) was tilted on one side to allow any precipitation to slide into the box. The plastic surface was drilled with holes to allow any precipitation to drain through the holes leaving the surface dry. The sampler's set up is shown in Figure 2.

was

measured

was

into

pre-cleaned

polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bottles. Deionized water was used to wash both the dry and glass surfaces to collect the deposited particulates and the washed water as well as any water present in the container was collected in PTFE bottles. The collected samples were acidified by the addition of 2 mL of concentrated HCl (PlasmaPure Plus) and stored in the refrigerator at 6-8oC until analysis. The samples were collected on a biweekly basis (once every two weeks) from both locations.

2.4

Analysis of Heavy Metals Atmospheric samples were acid digested using Questron's QLAB Pro digestion

microwave. For this purpose, 46 mL of deposition samples were transferred into separate digestion vessels and 4.00 mL of concentrated HNO3 (PlasmaPure Plus, 67-70%) was added to each vessel. The vessels were capped and the contents were mixed thoroughly and placed in the microwave digestion chamber. The digestion was carried out by using EPA method 3015 which is a recommended method for microwave assisted acid digestion of aqueous samples and extracts. The microwave digestion system, used for the digestion purpose, was obtained from Questron Technologies Corp, Mississauga, Canada (Model: QLAB Pro, Serial: 11-1018). With the EPA method 3015, the samples are preheated to 100oC in 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Then they are heated to 160oC in 10 minutes and finally from 160oC to 170oC during the last 10 minutes. Once digestion was complete, the vessels were allowed to cool before the contents were transferred to clean I-CHEM 25 mL vials.
16

These digested samples were analyzed for the eight different heavy metals which include arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn). The analysis was done by using ICP-AES (Spectro Analytical Instruments, Model Spectroflame, Type FCPEA83F) which make use of the atomic emission spectroscopic technique. Emission spectroscopy uses the inductively coupled plasma to produce excited atoms and ions that emit electromagnetic radiation at certain wavelengths which are the characteristic of a particular element. The intensity of this emission is indicative of the concentration of the element in the sample. As an output, the concentration (µg L-1) of the selected metals is determined. These concentrations are then used to calculate the deposition rates of the analyzed metals. Operational parameters of ICP-AES that were used during analysis of the heavy metals in the atmospheric deposition samples are given in Appendix I, Table 1.

2.5

Calibration and standardization After the samples were digested and ready for analysis, calibration was undertaken in

order to convert the instrumental signals to the concentrations of heavy metals in the samples. The calibration contained five non-zero points, and three blanks. Ultrapure deionized water (18M) was used as a reagent water to prepare all the reagents and standards. The standard analytical solutions were obtained from Ultra Scientific with item numbers; ICP-033, IAA-048, IAA-027, ICP-129, IAA-025, IAA-028, IAA-082 and IAA-030 respectively for As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn. The concentration of As standard was 1000 µg mL-1 whereas that of the other solutions was 10,000 µg mL-1. To prepare a standard solution of 1 µg mL-1, 100 µL of As (having stock concentration 1000 µg mL-1) and 10 µL of each of Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb & Zn (having stock concentration
17

10,000 µg mL-1) were taken in a 100 mL flask. The flask was diluted to 100 mL with reagent water having a 5.6% HNO3 solution. To prepare the rest of the standards, 25.0, 5.00, 0.50 & 0.05 mL of the above prepared (1 µg mL-1) solution were taken in four separate 50 mL flasks and diluted to the mark with the 5.6% HNO3 solution to get the solutions of 1000 , 500, 100, 10 and 1 µg L-1 respectively. These standards were digested in the microwave and analyzed by ICP-AES using the same conditions as the atmospheric samples. To construct the calibration curves, three sets of the standards were prepared and analyzed on different days. The average of the three analyses was used to construct the calibration curves shown in Figure 3 below.

As shown in figure 3, the coefficient of determination (R2) was found to be in the range of 0.9937-1.0 (R2 gives the proportion of the variance of one variable that is predictable from the other variables, i.e. it represents the percent of the data that is the closest to the line of best fit. For example R2 = 0.9950 means that 99.50% of the total variation in y can be explained by the linear relationship between x and y).

Quality Control (QC)

2.6.1. Blanks A set of blanks was analyzed by ICP-AES right after the calibration curves were constructed. Blanks were prepared and analyzed using lab-ware, reagents and analytical procedures identical to that used to prepare and analyze the standards and the samples. The purpose of running blanks was to check the reproducibility of the method. Blanks were also used to determine the method detection limits. The graphs of the blank data are shown in the Appendix I, Figure 1. The field blanks were also collected with each batch of samples and their concentrations were subtracted from the concentration of each sample in the batch in order to avoid any contamination during the process of sampling, transport, storage and analysis. To assess any contamination from the laboratory environment, laboratory reagent blanks (LRB) were analyzed at the rate of at least one LRB per 20 samples (the criteria was that the blanks should be below the method detection limit otherwise it indicates a source of contamination).

2.6.2. Method Detection Limit Method detection limits (MDL) were established against the most sensitive wavelength for the individual element. The wavelengths used were 189.042 nm for As, 226.502 nm for Cd,
20

228.616 nm for Co, 654.792 nm for Cu, 257.610 nm for Mn, 231.604 nm for Ni, 168.215 nm for Pb and 213.856 nm for Zn. Blanks were used to calculate the MDL. The standard deviation of the blanks was used to calculate the MDL by using the following equation 1.1 (USEPA method "40 CFR Appendix B to Part 136"). MDL = t × S ------------------------- (1.1) Where; t is the Students' t value for a 99% confidence level and a standard deviation estimate with n-1 degrees of freedom and S is the standard deviation of the replicates. The student's tvalue (3.14) was taken at 99% confidence level against 6 degrees of freedom. The MDLs were found to be 1.78, 0.32, 0.45, 5.70, 0.33, 1.45, 0.22 and 5.81µg L-1 for As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn respectively.

2.6.3. Method Validation The quality control samples (QCS) were used to demonstrate the initial verification of the calibration standards in order to verify the instrument performance and to validate the method. The QCS were obtained from a source different from the standard stock solutions and prepared in the same acid mixture as the calibration standards. For this purpose a standard reference material (SRM) NIST 1643e (trace elements in water) was used. The mean concentrations from three analyses of the QCS were found to have percentage recoveries of 104.53% for As, 105.34% for Cd, 100.31% for Co, 96.88% for Cu, 101.73% for Mn, 104.56% for Ni, 105.66% for Pb and 95.27% for Zn. The exact values are given in Appendix I Table 2. 2.6.4. Assessing Laboratory Performance To demonstrate that the analytical batch was within the performance criteria of the method and that acceptable precision and recovery was being maintained within each analytical
21

batch, the laboratory fortified solutions (also known as ongoing precision and recovery samples) having concentration 20 µg L-1 were analyzed prior to the analysis of each analytical batch. The % recovery of the elements in each batch was calculated by using the equation 1.2. R=

LFS - LRB × 100 ------------------------- (1.2) C

Where; R is % recovery, LFS is the laboratory fortified solution, LRB is the laboratory reagent blank and C is the concentration of analyte added to fortify the solution. The percent recovery which was obtained during the entire analysis was found to be in-between 90-110%.

2.6.5. Assessing matrix effects To assess the performance of the method on the sample matrix, the samples were spiked with a known concentration to a minimum of 10% of the routine samples. For each case the spiked aliquot (spiked to a certain concentration) was a duplicate of the aliquot used for sample analysis. The concentrations of sample as well as the spiked sample were measured and the percent recovery in each of the spiked sample was calculated using the equation 1.3 which is given below. R=

(C S - Cb ) × 100 ------------------------- (1.3) C

Where; R is the percent recovery, Cs is the measured concentration of the analyte after spiking, Cb is the blank concentration (before spiking) and C is the spiked concentration. The % recoveries (R) ranged between 93-112% which were within the EPA range (70-130%) (USEPA Method 200.7).

2.7.

Deposition rate's calculation The atmospheric samples (Sept. 2009­Dec. 2010) were analyzed by using ICP-AES to

get the concentrations of the different heavy metals. Since the sampling was done, most of the times, on a biweekly basis but sometimes randomly, the concentrations were averaged on monthly basis. The concentrations of the heavy metals were then used to calculate the deposition rates of these metals. The deposition rates were calculated as a mass deposited per unit area per unit time (Sharma et al., 2008). Deposition rate (R) =

m -------------------------- (1.4) t×A

Where; m is the mass of the metal deposited (µg), A is the area (m2) and t is the period of sample collection. To get the deposition rates per month (µg m-2month-1), monthly concentrations were used. The mass was calculated by multiplying the concentration (µg L-1) by the total volume (L) of samples measured during sample collection. The deposition rates on each surface were then summed up to get the annual deposition rate (µg m-2a-1).

23

2.8.

Calculating the enrichment factor Enrichment factor (EF) can be calculated to do the comparison between sites/surfaces

(Florence et al., 2012; Fabian et al., 2011; Jeffries and Snyder, 1981) by taking one of the sites/surfaces as a reference. According to Baut-Menard and Chesselet (1979), the enrichment factor (EF) can be defined by equation 1.5

EF =

XA ------------------------- (1.5) XB

Where; XA is the deposition rate of a metal X on a surface A and XB is the deposition rate of that metal in the reference surface B i.e. glass surface.

Concentration of heavy metals at the JOR site

The concentration of heavy metals on JOR sites showed that the concentrations of As ranged between 2.50­23.18 µg L-1 (11.23±7.59), 2.02­21.13 µg L-1 (8.21±6.40) and 1.93-27.94 µg L-1 (10.26±9.75) respectively on plastic, glass and water surfaces. For Cd, on Aug. 09, 2009, huge values were found i.e. 2493.58 µg L-1 on plastic, 2489.49 µg L-1 on glass, and 2489.69 µg L-1 on water surface. But these high values were not found on KHN site for the same date. So these values were taken out as an outlier assuming that it could be due to contamination in the JOR samples for that period. Instead of these high values, the average of the rest were taken for this date and the values were 0.35-26.19 µg L-1 (11.75±14.28) on plastic, 0.45-29.92 µg L-1 (8.64±10.39) on glass and 1.68-24.32 µg L-1 (11.97±7.80) on water surface.

For Cu, they ranged between 10.63-45.93 µg L-1 (25.89±13.72) on plastic, 6.26-113.11 µg L-1 (35.03±36.70) on glass and 10.41-133.00 µg L-1 (47.15±40.66) on water surface. For Mn, their range was 4.65-107.02 µg L-1 (29.91±31.71) on plastic, 2.04-117.95 µg L-1 (24.67±38.22) on glass and 2.93-197.14 µg L-1 (59.87±63.60) on water surface.

For Pb, they ranged between 1.54-179.1 µg L-1 (33.66±48.76) on plastic, 1.09-125.39 µg L-1 (28.30±39.08) on glass and 10.14-96.01 µg L-1 (42.72±26.13) on water surface. For Zn they ranged between 11.31-288.47 µg L-1 (87.40±86.03) on plastic, 18.15-246.58 µg L-1 (85.97±72.76) on glass and 18.21-378.59 µg L-1 (150.09±131.22) on water surface (Appendix I Figure 3).

Deposition rates of heavy metals in Toronto Deposition rates were calculated using equation 1.4 and were plotted for individual

metals. On KHN site (Figure 4), the average deposition rates on plastic were calculated as 45.90±73.65 µg m-2month-1for As, 52.28±99.68 µg m-2month-1 for Cd, 34.74±63.98 µg m-2month-1 for Co, 151.27±223.84 µg m-2month-1 for Cu, 274.67±248.78 µg m-2month-1 for Mn, 62.38±92.84 µg m-2month-1 for Ni, 210.64±395.04 µg m-2month-1 for Pb and 716.25±1212.13 µg m-2month-1 for Zn. On glass surface, these values were As (56.18±88.20 µg m-2month-1), Cd (86.53±153.89 µg m-2month-1), Co (43.16±71.94 µg m-2month-1), Cu (147.95±150.54 µg m-2month-1), Mn (324.68±430.45 µg m-2month-1), Ni (55.03±94.08 µg m-2month-1), Pb (471.28±1187.69 µg m-2month-1), and Zn (668.83±990.79 µg m-2month-1) whereas on water surface these values were As (93.25±108.39 µg m-2month-1), Cd (95.72±151.84 µg m-2month-1), Co (89.19±123.37 µg m-2month-1), Cu (538.69±553.45 µg m-2month-1), Mn (1212.41±1263.78 µg m-2month-1), Ni (331.83±783.05 µg m-2month-1), Pb (612.92±891.42 µg m-2month-1), and Zn (2383.93±2741.89 µg m-2month-1). Similarly the deposition rates were plotted on JOR site (Figure 5). On the plastic surface, the average deposition rates were calculated as As (36.26±82.79 µg m-2month-1), Cd (67.88±141.50 µg m-2month-1), Co (31.30±62.74 µg m-2month-1), Cu (167.53±246.74 µg m-2month-1), Mn (278.57±379.55 µg m-2month-1), Ni (89.98±152.34 µg m-2month-1), Pb (160.62±213.64 µg m-2month-1), and Zn (654.63±981.54 µg m-2month-1). On glass surface, these values were As (47.31±82.49 µg m-2month-1), Cd (50.32±118.30 µg m-2month-1), Co (24.75±46.59 µg m-2month-1), Cu (253.90±404.75 µg m-2month-1), Mn (225.82±374.75 µg m-2month-1), Ni (64.49±104.95 µg m-2month-1), Pb (395.46±689.87 µg m-2month-1), and Zn

(582.88±595.51 µg m-2month-1) whereas on water surface these values were As (79.21±114.94 µg m-2month-1), Cd (84.70±95.91 µg m-2month-1), Co (56.58±73.81 µg m-2month-1), Cu (696.26±905.17 µg m-2month-1), Mn (1060.55±1396.74 µg m-2month-1), Ni (122.87±159.29 µg m-2month-1), Pb (590.24±737.22 µg m-2month-1), and Zn (1935.91±2098.55 µg m-2month-1). The results showed that Zn had the higher deposition rates than other heavy metals. Other metals with the higher deposition rates were Mn, Cu and Pb. An evaluation of the relationships between the deposition rates of heavy metals revealed that some strong correlations exist among Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn as they increase and/or decrease. Local sources like vehicle emissions and domestic heating could be the possible sources of higher deposition rates of these metals in Toronto.

Distribution of heavy metals on different surfaces A statistical test called analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to conclude if the

sets of data (deposition rates) on three surfaces were statistically significantly different from each other i.e. whether the surfaces behaved similarly or differently throughout the sampling period. For almost all the metals, on both sites, the Fcalculated was higher than Fcritical (Fcalc > Fcrit). The Fcritical value was found to be 2.01, on both the sites whereas the Fcalculated were found in the range of 3.52­7.87 (all different analyzed metals) for KHN site and 2.68­19.70 for JOR site which means that for all the analyzed metals, the deposition rates were statistically significantly different on different surfaces. The variability of deposition rate showed that the minimum and maximum deposition rates, encountered during the studied period, were high and not proportionally distributed around the median (Figure 6) with the maximum values too high from the median in majority of the cases. The box plot show how the heavy metals were distributed on different surfaces. The medians of the heavy metals on plastic surface was found to be As (KHN=27.16 & JOR=13.80), Cd (KHN=13.74 & JOR=18.37), Co (KHN=7.88 & JOR=7.79), Cu (KHN=128.47 & JOR=108.26), Mn (KHN=262.95 & JOR=140.93), Ni (KHN=20.75 & JOR=49.27), Pb (KHN=93.18 & JOR=113.41) and Zn (KHN=426.39 & JOR=296.41), on glass surface, these values were As (KHN=16.63 & JOR=37.67), Cd (KHN=24.34 & JOR=27.00), Co (KHN=10.60 & JOR=9.98), Cu (KHN=238.45 & JOR=115.12), Mn (KHN=243.97 & JOR=54.40), Ni (KHN=20.16 & JOR=71.69), Pb (KHN=57.82 & JOR=106.62) and Zn (KHN=263.89 & JOR=558.38) and on water surface the medians were As (KHN=36.90 & JOR=30.86), Cd (KHN=42.04 & JOR=126.10), Co (KHN=22.34 & JOR=38.10), Cu (KHN=494.94 &

31

JOR=347.43), Mn (KHN=906.37 & JOR=500.43), Ni (KHN=96.12 & JOR=88.20), Pb (KHN=272.89 & JOR=368.75) and Zn (KHN=1394.38 & JOR=1006.85). As the box plot (Figure 6) indicates, the general trend for most of the metals was that the medians were skewed more towards the lower side of the interquartile with a few exceptions, as Mn and Zn on plastic and wet surfaces of the KHN site were distributed equally on both side of the interquartile, Pb was thoroughly distributed equally except on the glass surface on JOR whereas Cu on glass surface of KHN site showed that the median was skewed more towards the upper side of interquartile. This indicated that, for majority of the metals, the maximum values of the deposition rates were too high than their median values.

Surface comparison

To study the deposition pattern on the three surfaces, deposition rates on these surfaces were compared by determining the elemental enrichment factor using equation 1.5. The mean values of the monthly deposition rates (Figure 3 & 4 for KHN and JOR sites respectively), on three surfaces, were used to calculate the EF. The results (Table 3) shows that the deposition rates were almost similar on both the plastic and glass surface (with exception of Cd and Pb) whereas they were different on water surface. The EF for water surface was more than twice the dry surfaces with the exception of As, Cd and Pb where they were almost 1.5 times higher. For Cu, Mn and Zn, they were more than three times higher than that of dry surfaces. So it was concluded that the tendency of water surface to absorb/retain heavy metals from the atmosphere was quite high when compared to dry surfaces. This could probably be due the reason that the particles could be easily trapped or absorbed in the water due to hydrogen bonding. Also the dry surfaces were more or less similar in their behavior. This could be due to the reason that the most of the deposited particles do not interact with the surface material instead they are attached to the surfaces because of the sticking properties. The particles could react with the surface material as the polypropylene (plastic) is liable to chain degradation from exposure to heat and UV radiation (such as that present in sunlight). Oxidation usually occurs at the tertiary carbon atom present in every repeat unit. A free radical is formed here, and then reacts further with oxygen, followed by chain scission to yield aldehydes and carboxylic acids but normally anti-oxidants are added to prevent polymer degradation. Also, borosilicate glass, having a very low thermal expansion coefficient, is so widely used (e.g. in laboratory equipment, telescope mirrors) due to its chemical and thermal resistance and good optical clarity, but the glass can be reacted with sodium hydride to produce sodium borohydride, a common laboratory reducing agent.

Effect of height on the deposition of heavy metals (Sites Comparison) The influence of height on the deposition rate of heavy metals was tested by comparing

the deposition rates at two roofs of variable heights, viz. KHN (~15 m) and JOR (~ 59 m). The mean of the individual metals on three surfaces (Figure 7) showed that the deposition rates of heavy metals were higher at lower height (KHN) than at JOR (with the exception of Cu) indicating that most emissions from the ground level are deposited at lower heights. This suggested that local sources like vehicle emissions and residential heating emissions might have contributed to the heavy metals deposition (Davis et al, 2011; Popescu, 2011). Only Cu showed the opposite trend, i.e. it was found to be higher at JOR. It may be either due to the reason that local emission of Cu was comparatively less than regional one or the size of Cu particles was small so that they are less influenced by the gravity.

Comparison of deposition rates of heavy metals in Toronto with other studies The deposition rates of heavy metals in Toronto were compared to those obtained in other

cities (Table 4). It was difficult to verify whether the deposition rates of As and Co in Toronto were higher or lower due to lack of information about the deposition of these elements in other cities. For Ni, there was only one reference value found for Ni (Andersen et al., 1978) which showed that the deposition rate of Ni (317 µg m-2month-1) in Denmark was comparable to that found in this study conducted in Toronto (55-331 µg m-2month-1). The deposition rate of Cd in Toronto (50-96 µg m-2month-1) was higher than Tokyo (5 µg m-2month-1), Amman (12 µg m-2month-1) and Bombay (50 µg m-2month-1), more comparable to Varanasi City (20-253 µg m-2month-1) but lower than Izmir (720 µg m-2month-1) and Lublin (185 µg m-2month-1). Copper's deposition rate in Toronto (148-696 µg m-2month-1) were more comparable to those obtained in Sydney (542 µg m-2month-1), Varanasi (272-902 µg m-2month-1), Tokyo (630 µg m-2month-1) and Amman (463 µg m-2month-1) but lower than that found in Michigan (930 µg m-2month-1), Bombay (1416 µg m-2month-1) and Izmir (3720 µg m-2month-1). Similarly, comparable deposition rate of Pb in Toronto was reported in other cities except in Izmir which is much higher (Table 4). The deposition rate of Mn was also comparable to the ones studied in Michigan and Tokyo. The deposition rate of Zn (583-2384 µg m-2month-1) was in agreement with Michigan and Lublin but less than all the other studies i.e., 2474 µg m-2month-1, 8100 µg m-2month-1, 873-7860 µg m-2month-1, 3933 µg m-2month-1, and 4500 µg m-2month-1 as were reported in Amman, Bombay, Varanasi and Sydney and Tokyo respectively. This means that the deposition rate of Zn in Toronto was smaller than most of the other cities.

37

In general, annual atmospheric deposition of heavy metals in different studies showed large variations, suggesting that emissions of heavy metals vary significantly between cities due to variations in sampling media, viz., this study (plastic, glass and water surfaces), Sydney (HDPE tank), Varanasi (spinach leaves), Bombay (particulate matter) and Amman (Cypress tree bark), traffic volume and local industrial sources.

The results generated from this study showed that the water surface observed the higher deposition rates compared to both plastic and glass surfaces in the urban environment of Toronto and that the deposition rate of heavy metals on plastic and glass surfaces were almost equal. It was also found that Zn had the highest deposition rates among other heavy metals. The other heavy metals with the higher deposition rates were Mn, Cu and Pb whereas the deposition rates of As, Cd, Co and Ni were considerably lower. It was also found that the deposition rates of heavy metals were also influenced by the height above the ground with higher deposition at lower rooftop of lower height (KHN) indicating contributions from local sources. Only Cu showed the higher deposition rates on JOR site instead of KHN whereas all the other analyzed heavy metals showed similar trend i.e. higher on KHN site.

Repetition of the atmospheric data In order to study the atmospheric deposition pattern after almost one year, atmospheric

samples were collected from October 2011-December 2011. A similar procedure was adopted from the collection till the analysis of the new samples. Same sites and surfaces were chosen with the only difference being the size of the surface of samplers exposed to the atmosphere. The sampling container's sizes were plastic (34 cm × 50 cm), glass (32 cm × 47 cm) and water (34 cm × 50 cm). The samples were analyzed using the same ICP-AES. The mass of the heavy metals deposited on each surface was calculated from the measured concentration (µg/L) and the volume of the sample collected. The deposition rates were calculated by using equation 1.4. Table 5 shows the deposition rates for the period of three months. Among the analyzed heavy metals, Zn was found to have the highest deposition rate with a range of 1114-2192 µg m-2month-1 (1616±281 µg m-2month-1). The metal with the second highest deposition rate was Mn, which was found in the range of 222-1072 µg m-2month-1 (672±219 µg m-2month-1) followed by Pb with the range 417-922 µg m-2month-1 (661±160 µg m-2month-1) and Cu 102-1068 µg m-2month-1 (545±211 µg m-2month1

). The rest of the metals were found to be in the order of Ni > Cd > As > Co with the values

65-361 µg m-2month-1 (208±117 µg m-2month-1), 40-373 µg m-2month-1 (194±128 µg m-2month1

), 78-270 µg m-2month-1 (174±65 µg m-2month-1) and 46-152 µg m-2month-1 (99±33 µg mmonth-1) respectively. When comparing surfaces, the water surface observed higher deposition

rates compared to glass and plastic as the average deposition rates on water surface (908, 135,240, 348, 779, 660, 222, and 1827 µg m-2month-1 for Mn, Co, Ni, Cd, Pb, Cu, As and Zn, respectively) was higher than plastic (554, 87, 209, 150, 597, 427, 133 and 1448 µg m-2month-1

for Mn, Co, Ni, Cd, Pb, Cu, As and Zn, respectively) as well as glass surface (476, 63, 150, 74, 519, 470, 142, and 1348 µg m-2month-1 respectively for Mn, Co, Ni, Cd, Pb, Cu, As and Zn). When compared for the two sites, the deposition rates were not found very different on KHN (749, 104, 220, 173, 696, 467, 178, and 1605 µg m-2month-1 respectively for Mn, Co, Ni, Cd, Pb, Cu, As and Zn) and JOR site (596, 94, 196, 217, 626, 623, 170 and 1626 µg m-2month-1 respectively for Mn, Co, Ni, Cd, Pb, Cu, As and Zn).

The first two conclusions were almost in accordance with the previous results i.e. Zn, Mn, Pb and Cu had the higher deposition rates (with Zn having the highest) as compared to As, Cd, Co & Ni and that the water surface had the higher deposition rate compared to plastic and glass. The third conclusion i.e. both the KHN and JOR sites had almost comparable deposition rates, was different from the previous results which indicate that KHN showed higher deposition than JOR. Overall, the results of the repetition samples showed the similar trend. So this could be taken as the validation of the data and also indirectly the validation of the method.

Part 2
AMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF TOTAL MERCURY AND METHYL MERCURY

1. 1.1.

Introduction Properties of Mercury Mercury (Hg) is a naturally occurring element generally referred to as a heavy metal.

Elemental mercury (Hgo) is a liquid at room temperature with melting point of ­38.9 0C and boiling point of 357.3 0C. It is one of the most volatile metals known and once it gets

evaporated, it becomes a colourless, odourless gas. In the atmosphere, it can be transformed into its various forms through abiotic and biogeochemical processes (Environment Canada, 2004; Gochfeld, 2003). Mercury has different common species which can have their own unique impact on the environment. In the atmosphere, mercury can be present in a gaseous phase, incorporated with atmospheric precipitation or associated with air borne particulate matter (Hgp). Hg in the gaseous phase has been operationally divided into gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) and gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM). Hg in aqueous media can be in the form of inorganic and organic mercury derivatives. Landfills and the oceans have been found to be the known sources of organic mercury compounds to the atmosphere (Pongratz and Heumann, 1999; St. Louis et al., 2005). Mercury can exist as two different kinds of cations: Hg2+ and Hg22+. The cation, Hg2+, is generally more stable and can form inorganic compounds with sulfur, oxygen, and hydroxyl ions (Environment Canada, 2004; Tan et al., 2000). Some other common mercury compounds are: mercuric chloride (HgCl2), mercurous chloride (Hg2Cl2), methyl mercury (CH3Hg) and dimethyl mercury ((CH3)2Hg) (CLS, 2000; Gochfeld, 2003). Mercury also combines readily with other
45

elements such as tin, copper, gold and silver to form mercury alloys known as amalgams (Environment Canada, 2004). Under normal conditions, about 98% of atmospheric mercury is in the form of Hg0, with a residence time of 1-1.5 years (Environment Canada, 2004). This can allow mercury to be transported in the atmosphere on a regional or global scale (Gochfeld, 2003; Lindqvist, 1994). This tends to create Hg0 air pollution, which is less localized and more pervasive than other mercury species. High levels of Hg0 have been observed in remote regions far from anthropogenic sources (Fitzgerald et al., 1998). The Hg0 can be deposited into aquatic systems via deposition to water surfaces directly, or to land with eventual runoff which may eventually be converted into methyl mercury (MeHg) via bacterial interactions (Gochfeld, 2003). GOM is less volatile and more water-soluble than Hg0 and is more likely to be removed by rain, absorbed by terrestrial surfaces and adhered to atmospheric particulate matter. GOM and Hgp are the primary atmospheric forms responsible for the dry deposition of Hg (Lyman et al., 2007). Hg2+ has a residence time of less than two weeks in the atmosphere, and may be rapidly taken up in rain, water, snow, or adsorbed onto small particles through wet or dry deposition (Environment Canada, 2004). It is also possible for Hg2+ to gain a methyl group, normally through biological processes, producing MeHg, which can be emitted to the atmosphere (Environment Canada, 2004). Any dimethyl mercury (Me2Hg) that is released into the atmosphere tends to be short-lived, and undergoes rapid oxidation (Schroeder and Munthe, 1998). The release of Me2Hg from upwelling areas in the ocean can lead to a reaction with hydroxide (OH) and chlorine (Cl) radicals to form MeHgCl or MeHgOH (Niki et al., 1983; Schroeder and Munthe, 1998). This can lead to small concentrations of MeHg in both the air and precipitation which can then be deposited away from its source through both wet and dry
46

deposition (Schroeder and Munthe, 1998). The hydride species, MeHgH is known to be unstable in water and is known to decompose rapidly to Hg0 and MeHg (Filippelli et al, 1992).

1.2.

Toxicity of Mercury Mercury is a highly toxic metal that can pose health risks to humans and wildlife

(Clarkson, 1993; Facemire et al., 1995; Meyer et al., 1995). Classified as a persistent bioaccumulative toxin (PBT), mercury does not break down over time but undergoes transformation from one form to the other in the natural environment. Toxicological concerns of mercury contamination focus primarily on MeHg, a highly toxic compound that readily accumulates in organisms and biomagnifies in food webs to concentrations that vastly exceed those in surface water (Scheuhammer et at., 2007; Chasar et al., 2009; Rolfhus et al., 2011). For example, due to the processes of bioaccumulation, even small quantities of MeHg in water can result in levels 1-10 million times higher in fish and fish-eating animals such as loons (Driscoll et al., 2007). The level of toxicity can be connected with the different chemical characteristics of the mercury species like a compound's lipid solubility, giving these compounds the ability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify (Clarkson, 1994; MassDEP, 1996; CLS, 2000; Goldman et al., 2001). A mercury species level of toxicity can also be linked to its method of absorption (Environment Canada, 2004; Gochfeld, 2003). Hg0, for instance, is well absorbed by the lungs, but not the skin or gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Gochfeld, 2003). On the other hand, MeHg, has been found to be easily absorbed through the lungs, blood-brain barrier, GI tract, liver and the skin (Clarkson, 1994; MassDEP, 1996; Schroeder and Munthe, 1998; CLS, 2000; Gochfeld, 2003; Environment Canada, 2004). This means that MeHg can affect an individual via
47

inhalation, ingestion, and direct dermal contact (Clarkson, 1994; Schroeder and Munthe, 1998; Goldman et al., 2001; Gochfeld, 2003). However, regardless of the organ, MeHg can be absorbed into the body about six times more easily than inorganic mercury compounds (Environment Canada, 2004). MeHg can also cross the placental barrier, affecting the fetal brain (Clarkson, 1994; Schuurs, 1999; Rice et al., 2000; Environment Canada, 2004). MeHg may even inhibit gap junctional intercellular communication of cells, which is a trait shared by some carcinogens (Zefferino et al., 2005). After it is transported to cells, MeHg can be broken down into Hg2+ (Clarkson, 1994; CLS, 2000). Once broken down, inorganic mercury is mainly excreted via urine and feces (MassDEP, 1996; CLS, 2000). MeHg, on the other, can take anywhere between 70 days to 4 months to be eliminated from the body, with the possibility of bioaccumulation of the compound during this period (MassDEP, 1996; CLS, 2000).

1.3.

Mercury in the atmosphere The atmosphere receives most of the emitted Hg, thus, it is the major pathway of

transporting Hg from its sources. Mercury can be released into the environment by either natural processes such as emissions from the earth's crust, water bodies, vegetation surfaces, wild fires, volcanoes (Schroeder and Munthe, 1998) or anthropogenic processes such as coal combustion, waste incineration, commercial product manufacture and disposal, metals refining, cement production and artisanal gold mining (Pacyna et al., 2006; Lindberg et al., 2007, Munthe et al., 2003; Pirrone and Mason, 2009). Although mercury can be found naturally in the environment, the anthropogenic activities have drastically increased the rates of mercury emissions to the atmosphere (Mason et al, 2005; UNEP Chemicals Branch, 2008). For instance, polar background levels of atmospheric Hg0 have been found, on average, to range between 1.0 and 1.6 ng m-3,
48

compared to mid-1850 estimates of 0.8 ng m-3 (Environment Canada, 2004; Cobbett et al., 2007; Ferrari et al., 2008; Kellerhals et al., 2003; Brooks et al., 2008). In 2000, the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) reported that nearly 47% of the released mercury was the result of industrial sources and 24% was from the primary base metal sector (NPRI, 2000). In the residential areas, mercury can also be released by a number of sources viz; Phenylmercuric acetate or phenylmercuric nitrate has been found in latex paints, contact lens solution, nasal spray and some other medications due to its inhibition of fungal, bacterial, and microbial growth (Swensson and Ulfvarson, 1963; Agocs et al., 1990; Carpi and Chen, 2001). Hg0 has also been used in equipment like thermometers, fluorescent light bulbs, thermostat switches, float controls in sump pumps, barometers, and gas flow meters (Spedding and Hamilton, 1982; Carpi and Chen, 2001).

1.4.

Atmospheric Deposition of Mercury Atmospheric deposition has been identified as an important source of mercury to earth's

surfaces like aquatic and terrestrial environments (Buehler and Hites, 2002; Landis and Keeler, 2002; Rolfhus et al., 2003). Atmospheric bulk deposition constitutes the mercury deposited through wet and dry processes. Wet deposition of Hg is defined as the air-to-surface flux in precipitation (occurring as rain, snow, or fog), whereas dry deposition is the Hg deposition in the absence of precipitation (Sakata and Marumoto, 2005; Lindberg et al., 2007). Although both dry and wet deposition processes contribute to the total atmospheric mercury budget, it has been estimated by a number of researchers that more than 50% of mercury entering the surface waters is a result of direct wet deposition (Sorensen et al., 1990; Lamborg et al., 1995; Scherbatskoy et al., 1997; Mason et al., 1997; Landis and Keeler et al, 2002). GOM is less volatile and more
49

water-soluble than Hg0 and is more likely to be removed by rain, absorbed by terrestrial surfaces and adhered to atmospheric particulate matter. A study has shown that Hg0 dry deposition rates may be more significant than previously understood (Lindberg et al., 2004). However, GOM and Hgp are the primary atmospheric forms responsible for the dry deposition of Hg (Lyman et al., 2007). Quantifying Hg bulk deposition is necessary in order to reduce the large gaps that exist in the global Hg mass balance estimates (Mason and Sheu, 2002) and also to attribute the sources of Hg for the development of policies regarding the control of Hg emissions (Lindberg et al., 2007). The atmospheric mercury depositions to watersheds result in an increase in concentrations of MeHg in aquatic biota including fish (Harris et al., 2007; Munthe et al., 2007). This is because following deposition, Hg(II) can be converted to MeHg in anaerobic environments such as lake sediments (Gilmour et al., 1992), hypolimnetic waters (Eckley and Hintelmann, 2006), and wetlands (St. Louis et al., 1994). Understanding the mercury emissions-to-deposition cycle is required for the assessment of the environmental risks posed by methyl mercury (Schroeder and Munthe, 1998; Sakata and Asakura, 2007). It has been recognized for many years that accurate measurement of relevant atmospheric mercury species is necessary to help elucidate the processes of emission, transportation, transformation, and deposition of atmospheric mercury. Since atmospheric deposition accounts for the Hg input to the surface environment, monitoring Hg species is the most direct way of assessing inputs from the atmosphere (Fitzgerald et al., 1998; Rice et al., 2009; Conaway et al., 2010; Leopold et al., 2010). Some of the previous studies have shown higher Hg in the urban atmosphere, which varied with the urban structure and height (Witt et al., 2010, Song et al, 2009; St. Denis et al.,
50

2006; Carpi and Chen, 2002; Liu et al., 2002). One of the studies (Cheng et al., 2009) showed that local sources which have never been identified nor reported might have contributed to the high Hg levels in the atmosphere. Also a recent study showed that buildings could be a major source of Hg to urban atmosphere (Cairns et al., 2011). This study will mainly focus on the analysis of atmospheric total mercury (THg) and MeHg. The majority of airborne mercury is Hg0 which makes ~ 90-99% of the THg. Hg0 is important because of its abundance in the atmosphere, as well as its extended residence time, allowing deposition to a wide range of locations (Lindqvist, 1994; Gochfeld, 2003; Environment Canada, 2004). MeHg is important because of its conversion from a wide range of mercury species, including Hg2+, Me2Hg, and Hg0, as well as its biomagnification potential and its ability to migrate through living cell membranes (Schroeder and Munthe, 1998; Gochfeld, 2003; Environment Canada, 2004).

2. 2.1.

Materials and Methods Sampling Locations The sampling locations and the samplers used for sample collections were same as

explained in Part 1. Please refer to sections 2.1 and 2.2 of Part 1 (page 14) for this information.

2.2.

Sampling and analytical procedures The information regarding sampling of atmospheric samples is given in 2.3 of Part 1

(page 15). The methods for the determination of THg and MeHg are were different than the rest of metals which are explained below.

2.3.

Determination of total mercury To determine the total mercury (THg) concentration, USEPA Method 1631, Revision E

(USEPA, 2002) was followed. For the analysis, 0.5 mL aliquot of bromine monochloride (BrCl) solution (see next page) was added to 100 mL of atmospheric sample in a bubbler and the mixture was left to react for 12 hours until all of the mercury was oxidized to Hg(II). After 12 hours, if the yellow colour disappears, it means that all of BrCl has been consumed. If so, more BrCl (~ 0.5 mL) was added and again left to react for 12 h). After that, the excess BrCl was removed by the addition of 0.25 mL of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH2OH·HCl) and left it to react for 5 minutes. To reduce Hg(II) to Hg(0), 0.5 mL of stannous chloride (SnCl2) solution (see page 55) was added and left to react for 20 minutes. The resultant elemental Hg was then removed from the sample solution by purging with nitrogen (N2) at a flow rate of 250 mL min-1 and was collected in a gold trap. Figure 8 shows the experimental set up for the purge and trap assembly.

The collected Hg was then thermally released by heating to 500oC and carried under argon atmosphere to the cell of CVAFS for quantification. Software Hg Guru 2.2 was used to integrate the peak area (or identify the peak height, if desired) of the detected signals. For the detection of THg, the "Total Hg" was chosen under the "Mode" menu and the run time was adjusted to 3 minutes. The experimental setup for the determination of THg is shown in Figure 9. Preparation of reagents: Among the reagents used during the experiment, BrCl was prepared by dissolving 2.7g of reagent grade KBr in 250mL of Ultra-Purity HCl inside a fume hood. The solution was kept well mixed by using a magnetic stirring bar and was stirred for approximately 1 hour. Then 3.8g of reagent grade potassium bromate (KBrO3) was slowly added to the acid

After all KBrO3 has been added, it was capped and was stirred for one hour. The BrCl prepared in concentrated HCl (strong acid) is also used to break all organic matrices (Hg-C) surrounding Hg. The reducing agent SnCl2 was prepared adding 10g of SnCl2·2H2O to 5 mL of Ultra-Purity HCl in a 250 mL glass beaker. The beaker was swirled to mix until all SnCl2·2H2O was dissolved. The solution was then transferred to a 50mL volumetric flask and filled to mark using nano pure water. The reagent NH2OH·HCl was prepared by dissolving 3g of NH2OH·HCl in reagent water and making the volume to 100 mL. To remove any traces of mercury present in the solution, 1.0 mL of SnCl2 solution was added and then purged overnight at 200 mL min-1 with mercury free N2 (USEPA method 1631-E).

2.4.

Determination of methyl mercury For the determination of methyl mercury (MeHg) , USEPA Method 1630 was followed:

45 mL of the preserved precipitation sample were pipetted into a fluoropolymer distillation vessel and the distillation was carried out at 25°C under Hg-free N2 flow until approximately 35 mL distillate was collected in the receiving vessel. The collected sample was adjusted to pH 4.9 with the addition of 2 mol L-1 acetate buffer and another 10 mL of reagent water were added to the vial to make the volume of the sample close to 50 mL. The sample was then transferred into a bubbler, and 0.04 mL of freshly thawed 1% sodium tetraethyl borate (NaBEt4) was added. The contents of the bubbler were allowed to react for 17 min so that all MeHg in the sample was converted to ethyl derivatives. After reaction, a Tenax trap (Carbotrap) was attached to the bubbler and the sample was purged with N2 (at 250 mL min-1) to transport the methylated mercury into the Tenax trap.

Figure 10: Purge and trap assembly for the analysis of MeHg. Tenax-TA traps are also made of quartz tubing (10-cm long x 6.5-mm diameter). The tube is filled with ~3.4 cm of 20/35 mesh Tenax-TA graphitic carbon adsorbent. The ends are plugged with quartz wool. Tenax-TA is a porous polymer that is based on 2,6-diphenyl-p56

phenylene oxide and can be used as both a column packing and as a trapping adsorbent for organic volatile and semi-volatile compounds. Figure 10 shows the purge and trap assembly for purging MeHg. Mercury was then thermally desorbed from the trap by heating the trap at 450oC for a period of 45 seconds. The desorbed Hg species were carried by an Ar gas stream, separated in a custom fabricated GC column, and converted to elemental mercury (in a pyrolytic column that was maintained at 700oC) before being transported into the cell of CVAFS for detection and quantification. For the detection of MeHg, "Speciate Hg" Mode was used and the run time was adjusted at 6 min. The experimental setup for the determination of MeHg is shown in Figure 11.

Preparation of reagents: To prepare the 1% NaBEt4, the reagent is purchased in 1.0 g air-sealed bottles as 1% Sodium tetraethyl borate (NaBEt4). First, 100 ml of 2% KOH in reagent water was prepared in a fluoropolymer bottle and cooled to 0oC. The bottle of NaBEt4 was then rapidly opened and 5 mL of the KOH solution was poured in it. The reagent bottle was capped and shaken vigorously to dissolve the NaBEt4. This was poured into the 100 mL bottle of KOH solution, and shaken to mix. The solution of 1% NaBEt4 in 2% KOH was then poured into small fluoropolymer bottles (7ml) and was placed in the freezer. Before and after using NaBEt4, the small vials were kept frozen at all times. Citrate buffer was prepared using 5.40 g citric acid and 7.34 g sodium citrate to make up 50 mL buffer solution. To purify the buffer solution of any traces of CH3Hg, 0.5 mL of 1% NaBEt4 was added and purged overnight with Hg-free N2 or Ar.

2.5. Calibration and standardization After the laboratory had established conditions necessary to purge and trap Hg species from the bubbler and to desorb them from the traps so that they can be analyzed by the CVAFS, calibration was done in order to calculate the Hg concentrations in the samples. The calibration contained five non-zero points and the results of analysis of three bubbler blanks (EPA methods 1631 & 1630). Ultrapure deionized water (18-M) was used as a reagent water to prepare all the reagents and standards for both THg and MeHg.

2.5.1 Calibration for THg National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certified 10,000 µg mL-1 aqueous Hg solution (NIST-3133) was used as a stock mercury standard. To prepare secondary Hg standard solution, 0.5 L of reagent water and 5 mL of BrCl solution was added to a 1.00 L
58

volumetric flask followed by the addition of 0.100 mL of the stock mercury standard. The flask was filled to 1.00 L with reagent water to obtain solution containing 1.00 µg mL-1 of mercury. To prepare Hg working standard, 1.00 mL of the above prepared secondary Hg standard was diluted to 100 mL with reagent water containing 0.5% BrCl solution. The resulting solution contained 10.0 µg L-1. Aliquots of 0.025, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 mL of this working solution were respectively diluted to 100 mL with reagent water containing 0.5% BrCl to get standards of 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 25.0, 50.0 and 100.0 ng L-1. These standards were taken into bubblers, and excess BrCl was reduced by the addition of 0.25 mL of NH2OH solution, and finally the reduced sample was reacted with 0.5 mL of SnCl2 solution which converted the Hg into volatile Hg which was purged out and trapped in the gold traps and finally analyzed by CVAFS which gave the peak area as an output. For each calibration point, the mean peak area of the three blanks was subtracted from the peak area of each standard. The calibration factor (CFX) for Hg in each of the five standards was calculated using the following equation. CFX =

( AX ) - ( AB ) (C X )

-------------------------

(2.1)

Where; AX is peak area for Hg in standard, AB is the mean peak area of the blank and CX is the concentration (ng L-1) of Hg in that standard. Then, mean of all the calibration factors (CFm) was calculated along with the standard deviation (SD, n-1) and the relative standard deviation (RSD), where RSD = 100 × SD/CFm. The RSD was found to be  15% and the % recovery for the standards was in the EPA recommended range (75­125%) (see Appendix II, Tables 1, 2 & 3). The concentration of mercury in the samples was found by dividing the peak area of the samples by the CFm.
59

2.5.2 Calibration for methyl mercury Stock methyl mercury standard was used to prepare MeHg working standard. Stock methymercury standard was obtained from Brooks Rand Ltd. This stock solution contained methyl mercury as MeHgCl source and had a concentration of 1 µg mL-1 of MeHg. To prepare MeHg working standard, 0.10 mL of the stock solution was diluted to 100.0 mL with nanopure water containing 0.5% (v/v) glacial acetic acid and 0.2% (v/v) HCl in a fluoropolymer bottle. The concentration of MeHg in the resulting solution was 1.00 ng mL-1. Aliquots of 0.005, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mL of the working solution were diluted to 50.0 mL with reagent water to get standards of 0.1, 0.4, 1, 2 and 4 ng L-1. These standards were taken into bubblers, the MeHg was converted to volatile MeHg by reacting it with 1% NaBEt4 (prepared in 2% KOH solution) which was then purged out with N2 gas and trapped in the Tenax traps and finally analyzed by CVAFS. Calibration was done using different standards and calibration factors were calculated for each standard using equation 2.1. The mean value of the calibration factors and standard deviations (SD) were used to calculate RSD which was found to be below the EPA recommended limit i.e. < 15 (see Appendix II, Tables 4, 5, 6 & 7).

2.6.

Quality Control (QC)

2.6.1. Blanks Blanks are important quality control tools. During the entire study, field (method) blanks were collected with each batch of samples in order to determine any contamination introduced during sampling period as well as during sampling, transport, storage and analysis activities. Field blanks were analyzed along with each batch of samples and their concentrations were
60

subtracted from the concentration of each sample in the batch. This practice was carried out through the entire study period.

2.6.2. Method Detection Limit (MDL) Method detection limits (MDL) were calculated by using EPA method "40 CFR Appendix B to Part 136". For total mercury, seven replicates with a known concentration of 2.5 ng/L were analyzed using the laboratory equipment and the above mentioned method. Similarly, seven replicates were prepared for methyl mercury with a known concentration of 0.4 ng L-1 and analyzed under laboratory conditions. The standard deviation of the peak areas was used to calculate the MDL by using equation 1.1 (page 21). The student's t-value (3.14) was taken at 99% confidence level against 6 degrees of freedom. For THg, the MDL was found to be 1.11 ng L-1 whereas, for MeHg, this value was 0.11 ng L-1 (see Appendix II, Tables 8 & 9).

2.6.3. Initial Precision and Recovery (IPR) To establish the ability to generate acceptable precision and recovery, four replicates of the IPR solution (10 ng L-1 for THg and 0.4 ng L-1 for MeHg) were analyzed and their mean, SD and RSD were calculated. For total mercury, the IPR solutions with four replicates of 10 ng L-1 were found to have an average percent recovery of 109 % (101-118%) which was within the "EPA 1631-E" recommended range i.e. 75-121. The RSD was found to be 11 which was below the recommended value (21) in the EPA 1631-E. For MeHg, according to the EPA method 1630, the IPR should be in the range of 79-121%. Our average IPR (for four replicates of 0.4 ng L-1) was 93.99 % (86-104%) which is within the recommended limit (see Appendix II, Tables 10 & 11).
61

2.6.4. Ongoing Precision and Recovery (OPR) To demonstrate that the analytical batch was within the performance criteria of the method and that acceptable precision and recovery was being maintained with in each analytical batch, OPR solutions (25 ng L-1 for THg, prepared from SRM NIST-3133 and 0.5 ng L-1 for MeHg, prepared from MeHgCl standard solution obtained from Brooks Rand Ltd) were analyzed prior to the analysis of each analytical batch as well as after every 10 samples during the analysis. The percent recovery was found to be within the EPA recommended range (77-123%).

2.6.5. Method validation The quality control samples (QCS) were obtained from a source different than the Hg used to produce the standards routinely in this method; QCS were analyzed as an independent check of system performance. For THg, NIST 1641d and for MeHg, MeHgOH from Brooks Rand were used to prepare the QCS. The average % recoveries of 107.2% and 90.7% were obtained for THg and MeHg respectively (see Appendix II, Table 12).

2.6.6. Matrix Spike (MS) and Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) To assess the performance of the method on the sample matrix, the samples were spiked in duplicate, at a minimum of 10% interval (1 sample in 10). For this, the concentration of sample was measured. The sample was then spiked to get MS and MSD. The percent recovery in each of the MS and MSD were calculated using the equation. % R = 100(A-B)/C Where; A is the measured concentration of the analyte after spiking, B is the concentration before spiking and C is the spiked concentration. The % recoveries (R) ranged between
62

97-110% and 91-102%, respectively for the THg and MeHg which were within the EPA range (71-125%). Also the relative percent difference (RPD) between the MS and MSD were calculated by using the equation RPD = 200 ×

(D1 - D2) ---------------------- (2.2) (D1 + D2)

Where D1 is concentration in the MS sample and D2 is the concentration in MSD sample. The RPD values were always found below the recommended limit (24%).

3. 3.1.

Results and Discussion Deposition of THg The samples were analyzed by using CVAFS to get the concentrations of the THg in the

samples. Since the sampling was done by using the manual samplers, the volume was different in sampler. The mass of total mercury (ng) deposited on each surface was calculated by multiplying the concentration (ng L-1) by the volume (L) of each sample. Table 6 show the amount of total mercury (ng) deposited on each surface throughout the sampling period. The deposition rates for THg were calculated as a mass deposited per unit area per unit time using equation 1.4 (Part 1). Generally the samples were collected biweekly and then were averaged for a month to get the deposition rate per month. The deposition rates on each surface were summed up to get the annual deposition rates (µg m-2a-1).

The data was used to calculate the monthly deposition rates. This was done by dividing the deposition rate values by the number of days for each sampling periods and then putting the number of days in a particular month. For example, to calculate the deposition rate for the month of February, the sampling was done on Feb. 11 and Feb. 28. Prior to Feb. 11, the sampling was done on Jan. 28. So the sampling period was 14 days. The 3/14 parts of deposition rate were put
65

in January and 11/14 were counted towards February. From Feb. 11 to Feb. 28, all the days were in February. So the month of February contains 28 days (11 + 17). Similarly, the deposition rates were calculated for each month. The monthly deposition rates for all the three surfaces on both sites are plotted in Figure 13. At the JOR site, the values for water surface lay between 0.47-2.38 µg m-2 month-1 (with an average of 1.12 ± 0.57 µg m-2month-1), for plastic surface between 0.40-1.49 µg m-2month-1 (with an average of 0.78 ± 0.33 µg m-2month-1) and for glass surface between 0.47-1.29 (with an average of 0.77 ± 0.28 µg m-2month-1). These values at KHN site ranged between 0.51-1.79 µg m-2month-1 (0.96 ± .43 µg m-2month-1), 0.24-1.26 µg m-2month-1 (0.72 ± 0.27 µg m-2month-1) and 0.51-1.12 µg m-2month-1 (0.71 ± 0.20 µg m-2month-1) for water, plastic and glass surfaces respectively. Figure 12 shows clear variation in the deposition rates of the three surfaces with the highest deposition found in June and December 2010. The higher deposition in the month of June was probably due to the large amount of precipitation during the month and also because of the fact that dry deposition is higher during the summer period (Zhang et al., 2012).

The previous studies have shown that there is no significant difference between the bulk depostion and wet deposition fluxes (Guentzel et al., 1995; Iverfeldt and Munthe, 1993 and Guentzel, 2001). The comparison shown in Table 7 is done mostly with the wet deposition but some of the studies analyzed bulk deposition (due to the lack of data on bulk deposition). The

estimated total annual Hg deposition found in this study (JOR site = 13.49 µg m-2a-1 on water surface, 9.36 µg m-2a-1, on plastic and 9.20 µg m-2a-1 on glass surface and KHN = 11.52 µg m-2a-1 on water, 8.62 µg m-2a-1 on plastic and 8.55 µg m-2a-1 on glass surface) was comparable to the annual average of 13.50 µg m-2a-1 obtained in Steubenville (Keeler et al., 2006) and lower than the annual average of 16.70 µg m-2a-1, 18.60 µg m-2a-1, 39.00 µg m-2a-1, 30.1 µg m-2a-1 and 34.7 µg m-2 a-1 reported by Sakata and Marumoto, 2005; Zhang et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2002; Dvonch et al., 2005; and Guo et al., 2008, respectively (Table 7). The total mercury deposition found in this study is higher than 6-8 µg m-2 reported in the Great Lakes Region (Gay, 2009). This is because this study was carried out in an urban environment whereas the reported values for the Great Lakes Region were mostly from rural locations.

Distribution of THg among sites and surfaces The box plot shows how the THg is distributed on different sites in Toronto (Figure 13).

The median of plastic surface on JOR site (0.69 µg m-2month-1) in the boxplot is slightly skewed towards the lower side of the interquartile indicating that majority of the values are less than 0.70 µg m-2month-1 (with the maximum at 1.49 µg m-2month-1 and minimum at 0.40 µg m-2month-1) whereas on KHN site, the median (0.77 µg m-2month-1), is skewed more towards the upper side of the interquartile (with maximum at 1.13 µg m-2month-1 and minimum at 0.24 µg m-2month-1) indicating that the most of the samples have deposition rates of higher than 0.70 µg m-2month-1. On the glass surface, the median at JOR site (0.79 µg m-2month-1) is more towards the upper side of the interquartile showing that majority of the samples have a deposition rate higher than 0.75 µg m-2month-1 (with maximum value at 1.29 and minimum at 0.43 µg m-2month-1). On the other hand, the glass surface at KHN site have most of the values below 0.75 µg m-2month-1 (with maximum being at 1.12 and minimum at 0.51) and are skewed more towards the lower half of the interquartile. For the water surface at JOR site (0.47-2.38), the median (1.11 µg m-2month-1) is more skewed towards the upper side of the interquartile (with the maximum value way far from the interquartile) indicating that majority of the samples have the deposition rates higher than 1.00 µg m-2month-1 whereas on KHN site, the majority of values were found to be below 0.90 µg m-2month-1 (0.51-1.79 with median at 0.83).

Deposition of MeHg

The amount of MeHg (ng) deposited on each surface was calculated by multiplying the concentration (ng L-1) to the volume (L) of the sample. Table 8 show the mass of MeHg deposited on each surface throughout the sampling period. The deposition rates were calculated by using equation 1.4. The data was used to calculate the monthly deposition rates in a similar way as described in case of THg. Monthly deposition rates of MeHg are presented in Figure 14. The values for wet, plastic and glass surfaces on JOR site lay between 0.020-0.067 µg m-2month-1 (with average 0.042 ± 0.017 µg m-2month-1), 0.005-0.036 µg m-2month-1 (with average 0.012 ± 0.009 µg m-2month-1) and 0.04-0.034 µg m-2month-1 (with average 0.014 ± 0.008 µg m-2month-1) respectively whereas on KHN site, these values were 0.009-0.064 µg m-2month-1 (with average 0.032 ± 0.016 µg m-2month-1), 0.003-0.035 µg m-2month-1 (with average 0.011 ± 0.008 µg m-2month-1) and
70

0.05-0.032 µg m-2month-1 (with average 0.009 ± 0.008 µg m-2month-1). On plastic and glass surfaces, the highest deposition was observed during the month of December whereas, on wet surface there was reasonably high deposition during June which indicates that on wet surface, MeHg deposited either through dry deposition or wet deposition contributes to the total yearly MeHg budget whereas on dry surfaces, the MeHg deposition was only higher during winter.

Distribution of MeHg among sites and surfaces The box plot (Figure 15) shows how the MeHg is distributed among the sites and

surfaces during the study period. The median of plastic surface on JOR site (0.009 µg m-2month-1) in the boxplot is skewed towards the bottom of the interquartile indicating that
72

majority of the values are less than 0.010 µg m-2month-1 (please see Figure 10 for maximum and minimum values) whereas on KHN site, the median (0.010 µg m-2month-1), is skewed more towards the upper side of the interquartile indicating that the most of the samples have deposition rates of higher than 0.010 µg m-2month-1. On glass surface, the median at JOR site (0.007 µg m-2month-1) is more towards the lower side of the interquartile showing that majority of the samples have a deposition rate of lower than 0.01 µg m-2month-1. On the other hand, glass surface on KHN site have the median (0.006) at the center of the interquartile showing that the MeHg is proportionally distributed with the maximum far above the interquartile during the month of December. For water surface on JOR site, the median (0.028 µg m-2month-1) is more skewed towards the lower side of the interquartile (with the maximum value during December) indicating that majority of the samples have the deposition rates below 0.030 µg m-2month-1. Similarly on KHN site, the majority of values were found to be below 0.030 µg m-2month-1 (with median at 0.026). The maximum deposition was found to be during the month of December for almost all of the sites and surfaces.

Surface and Site comparison by means of Enrichment Factor

The monthly deposition rates of Hg species (THg & MeHg) in the atmospheric samples collected on both the sites (presented in Figures 12 and 14 respectively) showed that the deposition rates were almost similar on both of the dry surfaces (plastic & glass) whereas they differed on the water surface. To identify the best surface for heavy metals deposition, the surfaces were compared by determining the enrichment factor (Florence et al., 2012; Fabian et al 2011). Table 9 shows enrichment factor (EF) calculated by using equation 1.5, for all the three surfaces considering glass surface as a reference. The enrichment factors of THg on KHN site were found to be 1.0 for plastic surface and 1.4 for water surface whereas on JOR site they were 1.0 for plastic and 1.5 for water surface. In case of MeHg, the EF were found to be 1.2 for plastic and 3.6 for water surface on KHN and 0.9 and 3.1 respectively on JOR. These results show that the plastic and glass surfaces behaved quite
74

similarly towards the deposition of THg as well as MeHg whereas the water surface had higher deposition. So in general, it could be concluded that the water surface had the higher deposition than plastic and glass which were more or less similar in their behavior.

Table 10 shows the EF for both sites, using KHN as a reference site. The EF for THg was found to be 1.1, 1.1 and 1.2 for plastic, glass and water surface respectively. For MeHg, the EF was 1.1, 1.6 and 1.3 for plastic, glass and water surfaces, respectively. The results show that for THg, although the JOR site had more deposition, they were not significantly different but for MeHg the deposition was significantly higher on JOR site especially for glass and water surface.

THg vs MeHg The MeHg contribution to the THg (Table 11) was found to be highest on wet surface as

the percentage of MeHg with reference to THg (averaged on two sites) was 3.18% for wet, 1.50% for plastic and 1.34% for glass surface. This illustrates that the MeHg concentrations were always a fraction of the THg concentration thereby confirming the conclusions in other studies (Lee et al., 2000; St Louis et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2012). However, overall, MeHg tends to be a small percentage (< 5 %) of total mercury in larger systems, including soil, sediment, water, snow, and air (Bloom and Fitzgerald, 1988; Horvat et al., 2003; Munthe et al., 2003; Macleod et al., 2005; Rolfhus et al., 2003; St. Louis et al., 2005; Hammerschmidt et al., 2006).

The results generated from this study indicate that the deposition was highest on the wet surface, whereas the plastic and glass surfaces had almost equal deposition. When the two sites were compared, JOR with more height (~59 m) showed a higher deposition than KHN (height ~15 m) which indicated that the mercury deposition is influenced by global affects more than local ones. Seasonally, the deposition rates were higher in summer as well as in winter showing that in summer, the dry deposition might have contributed significantly whereas in winter the wet deposition might have contributed more towards higher deposition.

77

Conclusions
The monitoring of heavy metals in Toronto showed that Zn had the highest deposition rates among the analyzed heavy metals. The other metals with the higher deposition rates were Mn, Cu, and Pb whereas the deposition rates of As, Cd, Co and Ni were considerably lower. The deposition rates for most of the heavy metals were found to be comparable to the deposition rates found in other studies across the globe. Mercury was found to be low among all the referral studies. When surfaces were compared, the deposition was found to be higher on wet surface (water surface) as compared to dry surfaces (plastic and glass) whereas the dry surfaces were found to have almost equal deposition rates. Among the mercury species, MeHg contribution to the THg was 1.50% on plastic surface, 1.34% on glass surface and 3.18% on wet surface. It was also found that the deposition rates of heavy metals were influenced by the height above the ground with higher deposition on KHN site (lower elevation from ground level) as opposed to the JOR site (higher elevation from ground level). This gives indication that local sources might have contributed more to the surfaces at lower height as the heavier particles tends to settle faster under the influence of gravity. This trend was found to be opposite in case of mercury, i.e. the deposition rates were higher on JOR site as compared to KHN site which means that the global and the regional impact of mercury was higher than the local impact.

78

Future Work
It would be ideal to work concurrently at several other sampling locations. This could include other locations in the city of Toronto and across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). At least one sampling location should be close to the point emission sources which would give a more accurate idea of the contribution of the local sources to the total atmospheric budget. Also it would be an interesting idea to determine the heavy metal identity and concentrations in other environmental samples like plants, soil and sediments. As the sampling involved the development of manual samplers, future studies may wish to focus on the plausibility and reliability of other sampling techniques. The automatic samplers could be used for the further studies which could reduce the chances of contamination. Also there are a lot of high rise buildings in the downtown area which are built of either glass or plastic materials and they are vertical. Further avenues to explore would be conducting deposition studies on the surfaces placed vertical. Based on the resutls of this study, the studies may also be carried out in order to identify the potential sources of heavy metals as well as to assess their impact on human health.
