FAULT DETECTION AND ISOLATION IN AN AIRCRAFT ENGINE BLEED AIR SYSTEM
Lan Shang Doctor of Philosophy, 2011 Program of Aerospace Engineering, Ryerson University

ABSTRACT
High temperature pressurized bleed air generated in the engine compressor is used for air conditioning in a jetliner. The engine bleed air must be regulated to a target temperature in the bleed air temperature control system using cold ram air before it can be used in the cabin or other low temperature area. The bleed air system is a control system that consists of sensors, and valve actuators. Potential faults associated with these components need to be considered in the design of the control system. This dissertation focuses on fault detection and diagnosis of the bleed air temperature control system. The faults in temperature sensors and valve actuators are detected using two unscented Kalman filters. The source of a fault is identified using the squared residuals. Nonlinear governing equations for the engine bleed air temperature control system are derived in state space form. Convergence analysis of the proposed fault detection and diagnosis methods is conducted. Heat exchanger is another core component in the bleed air temperature control system. A common fault associated with a heat exchanger is fouling which reduces the heat transfer efficiency, introduces additional resistance to flow, and increases fuel consumption. This dissertation presents a heat exchanger fouling detection method based

III

on the valve control command of an engine bleed air temperature control system. Heat exchanger fouling is monitored by estimating the deviation of valve control command. A simulated bleed air temperature control system has been designed and built. Experiments have been conducted for temperature sensor fault, valve actuator fault, and heat exchanger fouling. Computer simulations for each of these cases are conducted and compared to experimental results.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION

1.1

Bleed Air Temperature Control System Bleed air is hot, compressed air taken from an aircraft engine, after the compressor

stage(s) and before the fuel is injected in the burners. This high-pressure, hightemperature engine bleed air is commonly used within the aircraft after cooling in several ways, including de-icing (Yeoman, 1994), pressurizing the cabin (Newman, et al., 1980) and air conditioning for passengers and avionics equipment (Ensign & Gallman, 2006). However, engine bleed air cannot be used directly due to its high temperature, and it must be cooled to the desired temperature, to be utilized appropriately in the cabin or other low temperature areas. The bleed air system is the heart of the environmental control system (ECS), (Hunt et al., 1995). The ECS in today's jetliners is designed to provide a safe and comfortable cabin environment at cruising altitudes that can reach 40,000 feet. At those altitudes, the cabin must be pressurized to enable passengers and crew to breathe normally. By government regulation, the cabin pressure cannot be less, at maximum cruise altitude, than the equivalent of atmospheric pressure at 8,000 feet. In addition to pressurization, the ECS controls air flow, filtration and temperature. Fig. 1.1 shows the ECS of an aircraft. The turbine drives the compressor that is used to increase the air pressure with a corresponding increase in temperature. The bleed air

1

temperature is then reduced in the heat exchanger, cooled by ram air. Reduction in temperature leads to water condensation in the air. A water extractor at the turbine inlet is used to remove most of the free water. A bypass line is used to adjust the turbine outlet temperature to the required value. The volume of air flowing round the bypass is varied by a temperature control valve.

Ram air is commonly used to cool the engine bleed air, and it is scooped from the aircraft boundary layer or close to it. The external air is forced through a scoop, which faces into the external air flow, through the heat exchanger matrix and then rejected overboard by forward motion of the aircraft.

2

Thermal conditioning of the hot engine bleed air is accomplished by first passing it through a heat exchanger device. The heat energy from the bleed air is transferred to the ram air stream. The heat exchanger presented in this thesis is called compact (crossflow) plate-fin heat exchanger (CPFHE). The compact heat exchangers are commonly used, due to their low weight and space requirement. Their large heat transfer area gives them excellent compactness and heat transfer characteristics (Kays & London, 1964). As shown in Fig. 1.2 the CPFHE is made by the stacking of corrugated sheets (fins) separated by planar sheets and closed on the sides by lateral bars. The gaps between constitute a fluid layer. A core is made of a large number of layers.

Fig. 1.3 shows three control configurations of aircraft bleed air temperature control system studied in previous research (Hodal & Liu, 2005; Shang & Liu, 2007; Shang, Liu, & Hodal, 2010), in which the bleed air temperature at the load is regulated by a valve controller. The output of the controller determines the ram air flow rate, or the bleed air

main/bypass flow ratio, or a combination of both. Sensors, valve actuators and the heat exchanger are key components in such a control system, and the potential faults associated with them need to be considered in the design of the control system.

Faults in Bleed Air Temperature Control System A fault is defined as an unpermitted deviation of at least one characteristic property

or parameter of the system from the acceptable behaviour. The fault is a state that may lead to a malfunction or a failure in the system. Faults can be classified based on several criteria, such as physical locations in the system, time characteristics of faults and the effect of faults on system performance. Fig. 1.4 shows the classification of faults.

Fig. 1.4 Classification of faults

When faults are classified according to their physical locations, three main faults can be defined: actuator faults, sensor faults, and plant component faults. The main source of sensor fault in the bleed air system is the load temperature sensor, which measures the bleed air temperature at the load. Resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) are often used in aircraft to measure the flow temperature. The potential faults associated with RTD are caused by the degraded ability to maintain resistance vs. temperature relationship over time, the lead wire resistance, and contamination of the sensor probe. The faults are represented by fixed or drifting measurement biases. The fixed bias refers that the difference between the measurement and its true value is a constant, while the drifting bias means that the difference is a variable of time. The ram air and bypass valves are driven by valve actuators. Faults in valve actuators include partial or complete loss of control effectiveness, and can be represented by the bias between actual and the fault-free valve opening angle under command. The

5

bias includes not only multiplicative but also additive fault of the actuator (Zhou & Frank, 1996), which can cause change in actuator dynamics and the value of valve opening angle. A plant component fault in the bleed air temperature control system is associated with the heat exchanger. During the life time of heat exchanger, deposit of extraneous materials build up gradually upon the surface of heat exchanger core, which is generally defined as fouling. The accumulation of these unwanted deposits reduces the heat transfer efficiency of the heat exchanger, and causes over heating in the air conditioning system (Wright, et al., 2009). In some situations the fouling layer can effectively restrict the flow through the fins and lead to an increase of the drag coefficient. This will consequently increase the fuel consumption (Ishiymama, et al., 2008; Bott, 2007).

1.3

Fault Detection and Diagnosis Methods Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) targets on identifying either that something

has gone wrong or that everything is fine in the system; and of determining the location as well as type of the fault (Willsky, 1976). In general, FDD method utilizes the concept of redundancy, which can be either a hardware redundancy (data-based) or analytical redundancy (model-based) as illustrated in Fig. 1.5. The basic concept of hardware redundancy is to compare duplicative signals by various hardware. The analytical

redundancy approach generally does not require additional hardware, it is usually a more cost effective approach compared to the hardware redundancy approach. However, the

6

analytical redundancy approach is more challenging due to the need to ensure its robustness in the presence of model uncertainties, noise, and unknown disturbances.

Fig. 1.5 Illustration of the concepts of hardware redundancy and analytical redundancy (Hwang et al., 2009)

Generally, the analytical redundancy approach can be divided into quantitative model-based methods and qualitative model-based methods. The classification of the existing FDD approaches is shown in Fig. 1.6. A quantitative model-based FDD method utilizes a mathematical model. The techniques commonly used are based on state estimation, parameter estimation, parity space, and combination of the first three. The principle of observer-based approaches is to estimate the system variables with a Luenberger observer for the deterministic case or a Kalman filter for the stochastic case and to use the estimation errors/innovations as residuals. In parity space approaches, residuals are computed as the difference between the measured outputs and estimated outputs and their associated derivatives. The parameter estimation method for FDD is based on the concept that faults typically affect
7

the physical coefficients of the process. By continuously estimating the parameters of a process model, residuals are computed as the parameter estimation errors. The role of residual evaluation is to detect when the residuals have changed sufficiently to make reliable fault detection. Binary decision and statistical decision are often used in residual evaluation. A binary decision is made from a comparison between the residual and a fixed threshold. In the field of statistical decision, a variety of detection techniques are available, such as generalized likelihood ratio test, sequential probability ratio test, and cumulative sum test.

Fig. 1.6 Classification of FDD methods (Zhang & Jiang, 2008)

For the model-based fault detection, faults are detected and isolated based on residuals generated by state variables or model parameter estimations. Kalman filter (KF), as a well known optimal state estimator for linear and Gaussian systems, is applied to detect sensor and actuator faults for linear systems with disturbance and measurement noise (Kobayashi & Simon, 2005; Kobayashi & Simon, 2007; Liu, et al., 2004). However, most systems in practice are inherently nonlinear. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been developed for nonlinear systems state estimation, and applied to detect faults for nonlinear systems (Yoshida & Iwami, 1996; Del Gobbo, et al., 2001), but unlike KF, the EKF is not an optimal estimator. In addition, if the initial estimate of the state is not near the actual value, or if the process is not modeled properly, the filter may quickly diverge, owing to its linearization of the nonlinear functions. As an alternative to the EKF estimator for nonlinear systems, unscented Kalman filter (UKF) has been proposed by Julier, et al., 1995, Julier & Uhlmann, 1997, and Julier & Uhlmann, 2004. Unlike EKF, which is based on the linearization of nonlinear function by first-order Taylor expansion, UKF uses the true nonlinear models and approximates a Gaussian distribution of the state variable. Furthermore, it is not necessary to compute the Jacobians in the UKF. For these reasons, the UKF is being used to estimate the state of a wide class of nonlinear systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (Cork & Walker, 2007; Qi, et al., 2008), satellite attitude determination system (Xiong, et al., 2007; Tidoroiu, et al., 2006), and heating ventilation air conditioning systems (Tidoroiu, et al., 2008). Other estimation tools such as neural networks (Kobayashi & Simon, 2005) and principal component analysis (PCA) (Mukherjee et al., 2005) have also been utilized for
9

FDD with applications to gas turbine engines. The neural networks approach provides an excellent ability for nonlinear estimation, but the time required for training neural networks to fully represent all possibilities can be excessive. PCA may represent an efficient approach when building a mathematical model of system under investigation is difficult, but selection of principal components can be challenging.

1.4

Heat Exchanger Fouling Detection During the life time of heat exchanger, deposit of extraneous materials, such as dirt,

scale, corrosion products or other material appears gradually upon the surface, which is generally defined as fouling and will interfere with heat transfer and/or fluid flow. Fouling is a phenomenon which occurs with or without a temperature gradient in many natural, domestic and industrial processes. 1.4.1 Types of fouling There are several types of fouling, and they are generally classified into the following categories (Epstein,1985). 1. Precipitation fouling ­ the crystallization from solution of dissolved substances on to the heat transfer surface, sometimes called scaling. Normal soluble salts precipitate on sub-cooled surfaces, while inverse soluble salts precipitate on superheated surfaces. 2. Particulate fouling ­ the accumulation of finely divided solids suspended in the process fluid onto the heat transfer surface. It includes gravitational settling of large

10

particles as well as deposition of colloidal particles by other mechanisms on to the heat transfer surface. 3. Chemical reaction fouling ­ deposit formation at the heat transfer surface by chemical reaction in which the surface material itself is not a reactant. 4. Corrosion fouling ­ the accumulation of indigenous corrosion products on the heat transfer surface.
5. Biological fouling ­ the attachment of macro-organisms (macro-fouling) and/or

micro-organisms (micro-fouling) to heat transfer surface, along with the adherent slimes generated by the latter. 6. Freezing fouling ­ the solidification of a pure liquid or constituents of a liquid solution onto a sub-cooled transfer surface. 1.4.2 Effect of fouling in heat exchanger Despite the cause or nature of the deposit, the accumulation of this unwanted deposit can reduce the thermal efficiency of the heat exchanger, which may cause over heating in air conditioning system. In some situations the fouling layer can effectively restrict the flow through the fins, which increases the demand for transport energy . In many cases, the deposit is heavy enough to significantly interfere with fluid flow and increase the pressure drop required to maintain the flow rate through the heat exchanger. Due to the reduced performance caused by fouling of heat exchanger, it may become necessary to remove the heat exchanger for cleaning, which is a time-consuming process. For an aircraft engine system where down-time is costly, condition based
11

maintenance (Rajamain, et al., 2004) is desirable to monitor the fouling level so that cleaning can be done only when necessary. Numerous methods have been developed for the fouling monitoring of heat exchanger. In some applications heat exchanger fouling is detected by observing a health related parameter, which are normally correction factors on the efficiency of the components. (Yoshida & Iwami, 1996; Persin & Tovornik, 2005; Borguet & Lenoard, 2009). The disadvantage of this method is that fouling is not easy to be detected due to the limitation in the mounting of pressure and temperature sensors. Statistical technique (Thomson, et al., 2000) is also used, which requires the collection of large amount of data.

CHAPTER 2 MODELING OF BLEED AIR SYSTEM

2.1

System Configuration and Modeling Assumption The aircraft bleed air temperature control system is shown in Fig.2.1. The mass

flow rate of the high temperature air from the engine is Wbleed (lb/s); the temperature is Thi (°F), and the pressure is Phin (psi). Most of the hot air is cooled through the hot side of the heat exchanger at a flow rate Wbleedmain (lb/s), while a small portion of the overall bleed flow is made to bypass the heat exchanger via the bypass channel at a flow rate of Wbleedbypass (lb/s), to be mixed downstream with the main bleed air flow coming out from the heat exchanger. Ram air is taken from the atmosphere at a mass flow rate Wram (lb/s). The inlet pressure Pcin (psi) and temperature Tcin ( °F) are determined from the ambient temperature Tamb (°F) and the ambient pressure Pamb (psi) (Hodal & Liu, 2005):

Tcin = (Tamb + 460)(1 + 0.2Ma 2 ) - 460
Pcin = Frec ( Pamb (1 + 0.2 Ma 2 ) 3.5 - Pamb ) + Pamb

(2.1)

(2.2)

where Frec is the pressure recovery factor, and Ma is Mach number. A control valve is placed in the ram air channel as well as in the bypass channel, and the ram air flow and the bypass flow are controlled to regulate the bleed air temperature at the load downstream. Assumptions are made as follows (Hodal & Liu, 2005):
14

a) transport delay between components is negligible; b) there is no heat loss to the surrounding environment through the pipes; and c) pressure loss due to pipe flow is negligible; and the flow is assumed to be fully developed.

Nonlinear Model of an Engine Bleed Air System Control valve and flow rate Control valves are placed at ram air channel and bypass channel to regulate the

temperature at load. Ball valves are used to manipulate the flow rate by changing the opening angle v (rad), and thus the opening area Av (inch2). Fig. 2.2 shows airflow passing through a ball valve. Valve opening angles v=0 rad and v = /2 rad correspond to full-close and full-opening, respectively.

in which Pu and Pd are the pressures upstream and downstream of the valve, respectively; g = 32.174 ft/s2 is the acceleration of gravity, R = 1717 ft2/ (s2°R) is the gas constant for air, and  = 1.4 (for air) is the ratio of specific heat capacity at constant pressure to specific heat capacity at constant volume. Similarly for the ram air channel, Equations (2.3) to (2.6) hold with Wv = Wram, Pu = Pcin, Pd = Pci, Tu = Tci,, Dv = Dram, v = ram, v = ram, and uv = uram; and for the bypass channel: Wv = Wbleedbypass, Pu = Phin , Pd = Pload (load pressure), Tu = Thi, D v =Dram, v = bypass, v = bypass, and uv = ubypass. 2.2.2 Pressure calculation When air flows through the heat exchanger, the pressure drop caused by heat exchanger is a function of flow rate. The bleed air and ram air side heat exchanger pressure drops are given as follows:
2 + K 2Wbleedmain Pdroph = Phi - Pho = K1Wbleedmain

(2.7)

2 Pdropc = Pci - Pco = K 3Wram + K 4Wram

(2.8)

17

where Phi (psi) and Pci (psi) are the hot and cold side pressures upstream of the heat exchanger, and Pho (psi) and Pco (psi) are hot and cold side pressures downstream of the heat exchanger, respectively. The constants K1, K2, K3 , and K4 come from empirical data of an industrial heat exchanger 1. The pressure at load is:

Pload = K load Wbleed 2 + Pamb
where Kload is the load impedance constant.

(2.9)

As a result of neglecting the pressure drop due to the pipe flow, some equivalency statements can be drawn between the pressures at multiple positions of the system: · the heat exchanger hot-side inlet pressure is equal to the bleed-air pressure leaving the source, Phi  Phin ; ·

the pressure at the hot-side heat exchanger outlet is equivalent to the pressure upstream of the load, Pho  Pload;

·

since ram air is dumped directly into the atmosphere, pressure at the cold-side heat exchanger outlet is equivalent to ambient pressure, Pco  Pamb.

2.2.3

Temperature calculation The cold air side inlet temperature of heat exchanger is the downstream temperature

of the ram air valve, which can be calculated using an equation for isentropic flow:
 -1 

 Pci Tci = Tcin  P    cin 

(2.10)

The temperature in Equation (2.10) is in Rankine. The load temperature is a mixture of bypass flow and cooled main bleed flow, and is determined as:

Tload =

ThoWbleedmain + ThiWbleedbypass Wbleed

(2.11)

The load temperature is measured by a thermal temperature sensor, which is associated with possible faults and measurement noise. The sensor dynamics is modeled as a simple first-order transfer function:
Tload ( s ) t s +1

Tloadm ( s ) =

(2.12)

where Tloadm ( °F) is the reading from a fault free load temperature sensor and t is the time constant of the sensor.

19

2.2.4

Heat exchanger dynamics The thermal dynamics of the heat exchanger are described by the following

equations (Erickson & Hedrick, 1999):

 =W T ho bleedmain (Thi - Tho ) / mh - H h (Tho - Tco ) /( mh C h )  = W (T - T ) / m - H (T - T ) /( m C ) T co ram ci co c c co ho c c

(2.13)

(2.14)

where the hot side fluid (bleed air) with a specific heat of Ch (Btu/lb°R) and mass mh (lb) flows at a flow rate Wbleedmain, and with the inlet temperature of Thi and outlet temperature of Tho. The cold side fluid (ram air) with a specific heat of Cc and mass mc flows at a flow rate Wram, with inlet and outlet temperatures Tci and Tco, respectively. Hh and H c

(Btu/s°R) denote the overall heat transfer coefficient of hot and cold side, respectively. The heat transfer coefficient is normally a function of surface geometry (which influences conditions in the boundary layer), nature of the fluid motion, and an assortment of fluid thermodynamic and transport properties (Incropera & DeWitt, 1996; Kays & London, 1964 ). For this study, the overall heat transfer coefficients are given as functions of flow rate,

H h = f (Wbleedmain ) H c = f (Wram )

(2.15)

(2.16)

20

These specific functions are determined empirically from experimental data on an existing heat exchanger used in the industry 2. 2.3 Discrete Time System Model The discrete time system representation of the bleed air system has the following equations: Mass flow rate

These nonlinear discrete-time equations will be used as prediction and update functions in proposed state estimator, and are assumed to be continuously differentiable.

2.4

Ram-air-plus-bypass Control Strategy The key in the control system design for the proposed ram-air-plus-bypass channel

configuration is to properly control the bypass channel such that both fast temperature response and reduction of ram air usage are achieved. To reach this goal, a small bypass valve opening is selected as a set-point, which is to be maintained at steady state. Upon system transient and disturbances, the bypass valve opening is controlled to provide a fast response in regulating the load temperature. However, since a reduction in ram air usage is sought along with fast transient, it is desired to have a low bypass flow rate. By setting the bypass valve set-point to a value that will result in a fairly low (e.g., 10 %) bypass ratio (bypass flow rate to total bleed flow rate), it is ensured that the system is not
22

overcooled to a large extent, which results in unnecessary ram air usage and associated fuel consumption.

Fig. 2.3 Ram-air-plus-bypass control strategy

In the proposed control system architecture as shown in Fig. 2.3, the bypass channel valve opening ratio ubypass and ram air valve opening ratio uram are treated as control inputs. The bypass channel valve will strive to bring about fast temperature regulation, while the ram air channel valve loop will act to let the bypass channel valve return to its pre-defined set-point. This control strategy can be implemented using conventional PI control with two control loops. The bypass channel loop regulates the load temperature with the following PI control law:  K P bypass  etemp ( s ) ubypass ( s ) =  K P bypass +   T s I bypass  

(2.23)

where etemp is the temperature error defined as the difference between the load temperature Tload and its set-point Tload_sp; KPbypass and TIbypass are the regular controller proportional gain and integral time constant, respectively.

23

The ram air channel loop is driven by the bypass-valve opening error ebypass, defined as the difference between the bypass valve opening and its pre-defined set-point, and the control law is given by

  K u ram ( s ) =  K P ram + P ram ebypass ( s )  TI ram s   

(2.24)

where KPram and TIram are the regular controller proportional gain and integral time constant, respectively. The ram-air controller action is indirect in nature and requires that the bypass control loop is closed; in this way, it forms the outer control loop, with the bypass controller being the inner control loop.

2.5

Simulation Results Using the dynamic equations and control laws derived in the above sections,

simulation studies have been conducted for all three control configurations shown in Fig. 1.3. Disturbances arising from changes in engine loading and/or atmospheric conditions are considered. The simulation results for a 40 °F step increase in bleed air temperature Thi are presented here. Unless specified otherwise, the following simulations use a temperature set-point of Tload_sp = 190 °F, pipe diameter D = 1.5 inch, and valve time constant v = 1.5 s for the ram and bypass channels. The simulation time step is typically 0.1 s.

24

2.5.1

Ram air channel control PI control is applied for the simulation of ram air channel control configuration

shown in Fig. 1.3(a). The output of the ram air control, equivalent to the input to the valve, is given by the PI control law

 K P ram  etemp ( s ) u ram ( s ) = - K + P ram   T s I ram  

(2.25)

where KPram and TIram are the PI-controller proportional gain and integral time constant, respectively. The operating conditions in terms of temperatures, pressures, and flow rates, along with the tuned PI-control parameters for the ram-air controller, are listed in Table 2.1.
Table 2.1 Initial values and control parameters for ram air channel control

KPram=0.2 Wram=0.0172 lb/s Phin= 45.11 psi

TIram=100 s Thi=380 °F Pamb= 10.11psi

Wbleed=0.0183 lb/s Tci=117.5 °F

To maintain the load temperature at a set-point, an increase in ram air flow rate is necessary to counteract the increased thermal energy carried by the bleed air. According to the simulation results, from the initial steady state value of Wram=0.0172 lb/s, the ram airflow rate increases to Wram = 0.0192 lb/s for a 40 °F increase in bleed temperature. As expected, the response time of this control scheme is rather large, as shown in Fig. 2.4, due to the sluggish heat exchanger dynamics.

25

This control scheme does have one major advantage: it does not waste any ram air. At steady state, the amount of ram air used is the lowest necessary value required for regulation; in other words, no overcooling of the heat exchanger hot-side stream takes place, unlike for cases with a hot-side bypass.

2.5.2

Bypass channel control For simulation of the bypass channel control configuration shown in Fig. 1.3(b), the

same temperature error etemp signal drives the bypass controller, with a PI control law identical to Equation (2.23). The operating conditions along with the PI-control parameters are listed in Table 2.2.
Table 2.2 Initial values control parameters for bypass channel control

KPbypass=5 Wram=0.273 lb/s Thi=380 °F Pamb= 10.11psi

Wbleed=0.0183 lb/s Tci=117.5 °F Phin= 45.11 psi

26

An increase in bleed air inlet temperature will cause the heat exchanger hot-side outlet temperature Tho to rise, and consequently a reduction in the bypass flow rate is required to restore the load temperature to its set-point. An important characteristic of this control scheme is its short response time, as confirmed by the load temperature response shown in Fig. 2.5. Disturbances in bleed air are also immediately felt, as indicated by the quite abrupt change in load temperature.

Without a control valve in the ram air channel, the ram air flow rate in this configuration is dictated by the heat exchanger cold-side pressure drop and is a function of the operating conditions (i.e., airspeed and atmospheric pressure). For this simulation, the ram airflow rate is constant at Wram=0.273 lb/s. Note that this value is much larger than that in the ram air channel control case.

27

2.5.3

Ram-air-plus-bypass channel control For the proposed ram-air-plus-bypass channel control, the bypass valve opening is

assumed to be at the desired set-point at initial, such that the ratio of bypass to total bleed flow is low (10%). The corresponding steady-state values are listed in Table 2.3.

Table 2.3 Initial values and control parameters for ram-air-plus-bypass channel control

KPbypass=6 TIram=30 sec Wbleedmain = 0.0165 lb/s Wbleedbypass=0.0018 lb/s

TIbypass=15 sec Wbleed=0.0183 lb/s Wram= 0.0198 lb/s Tci=117.5 °F

KPram=2 Phin= 45.11 psi Thi=380 °F

By modulating both ram air and bypass channel flow rates, this control strategy is able to deliver efficient load temperature response while lowering the ram air usage penalty that is generally associated configurations employing a bleed air bypass. The simulation results shown in Fig. 2.6 below agree with this hypothesis.

Load temperature (°F)

Time (sec) Fig. 2.6 Load temperature response to a 40 °F step in Thi under ram-air-plus-bypass channel control

28

In the initial stages, actions of the bypass control valve quickly reduce the temperature error, with the remaining error slowly diminishing with time. The small variations in load temperature, made more visible in the inset plot of Fig. 2.6, are due to the slower-acting ram air channel controller modulating the ram air flow rate in order to slowly bring back the bypass valve opening to its set-point. In terms of ram air usage, this configuration fares much better than the bypass channel control configuration. Only a slight increase in ram airflow rate, from the initial value of Wram= 0.0198 lb/s to a new value of Wram= 0.0233 lb/s, when a 40 °F increase in bleed air temperature is simulated. For comparison purposes, ram air usage for the three control configurations analyzed here are listed in Table 2.4 below, in terms of initial and final steady-state values of ram air flow rate. For the bypass channl control configuration, since the ram air flow rate is constant, the intial and final value is the same in Table 2.4.

CHAPTER 3 SENSOR AND ACTUATOR FAULT DETECTION AND ISOLATION

3.1 Unscented Kalman Filter Algorithm
UKF uses a deterministic sampling technique known as the unscented transform (UT) to pick a minimal set of sample points (sigma points) around the mean. The approach is illustrated in Fig. 3.1. The nonlinear function is applied to each point, in turn, to yield a cloud of transformed points. The statistics of the transformed points can then be calculated to form an estimate of the nonlinearly transformed mean and covariance. The sigma points are deterministically chosen so that they exhibit certain specific properties (e.g., have a given mean and covariance). As a result, high-order information about the distribution can be captured with a fixed, small number of points.

Fig. 3.1 The principle of the UT (Julier & Uhlmann, 2004)

30

Consider the nonlinear system represented by (2.21) and (2.22). The considered actuator fault b is used to augment the state vector x, which are together predicted by UKF. Since the prediction of the state vector x has the same procedure as the prediction of the augmented state vector, only prediction of the augmented state vector is presented in this section. The augmented state vector is,
x a ( k ) = [ x ( k )T

b ( k )T ]T

(3.1)

and a estimation of the augmented state vector is
^ a ( k ) = [x ^ a ( k )T x

^ T ]T b (k )

(3.2)

The actuator fault b is unknown and time varying, and the change of the actuator fault is modeled as a Gaussian white noise  with covariance Vb, which allows the UKF to the model for the estimator becomes

estimate b (Simon, 2006). The system noise is neglected in the estimation model. Hence

^ ,u , z ) ^ ( k +1) = f (x ^ (k ) , b x (k ) (k ) (k )

(3.3 a)

^ +v b ( k +1) = b b(k ) (k )

(3.3 b)

The prediction error covariance is

^ a ( k ) )(x a ( k ) - x ^ a ( k ) )T ] P a ( k ) = E[(x a ( k ) - x

(3.4)

31

A set of 2L+1 sigma points is derived from the augmented state vector xa and covariance   , where L = 4 for the bleed air system, is the dimension of the augmented

state vector.

^ a (k ) , i = 0 Xia ( k ) = x

^ a ( k ) and is where the constant  determines the spread of the sigma points around x

usually set to small values, 0.0001    1. The sigma points can be broken into the state vector and actuator bias components by
X a ( k ) = [ X ( k )T

B ( k )T ]T

(3.6)

where X(k) and B(k) represent the set of sigma points corresponding to the state vector and actuator bias vector, respectively. The prediction step is performed by propagating each column of the augmented sigma points matrix  () through the nonlinear function (3.3) and obtain the transformed sigma points matrix  (+1|)

X ( k +1 k ) = f ( X ( k ) , B ( k ) , u ( k ) , z ( k ) )

Y( k +1 k ) = h( X a ( k +1 k ) , u ( k +1) , z ( k +1) )

(3.24)

where Pxy is the covariance of state vector x and output vector y, and Pby is the covariance of actuator bias vector b and output vector y. Equation (3.23) can be rewritten as

Hence the estimation error e x ( k +1) in Equation (3.25) is equal to zero, and only the estimation error of actuator bias needs to be considered. The convergence analysis is based on the following lemma (Agniel & Jury, 1971; Tarn & Rasis, 1976): Lemma 1: Assume that k and V(k) are a stochastic process and there exist real numbers v min, v max >0,  >0 and such that ,

and

3.3 Fault Detection and Isolation Method
Detection and isolation of both sensor and actuator faults are considered for the bleed air temperature control system in this section. The sensor faults are represented by the difference between the fault free sensor output and the real measurement, and actuator faults are represented by the bias between actual and commanded valve opening angle. The proposed fault detection and isolation method works with a practical assumption that only one sensor or one actuator is faulty at a time. In the proposed method, sensor fault or actuator fault in the system will be detected by two unscented Kalman filters. One UKF is dedicated to sensor fault, which is denoted as UKFS, and another UKF, named UKFA, is for detecting actuator fault. A diagram of the proposed fault detection and isolation method is shown in Fig. 3.2 .

In UKFS, only sensor fault is considered in the system. The actuator fault b is not augmented with state variable x, and is not predicted. The error e, which is the difference

43

the actuator bias b is used to augment the state vector x, and the estimation value of  is derived. If no fault has occurred, the mean value of each element in actuator bias 

between predicted output   and sensor measurement y, is detected by UKFS. In UKFA,

 will remain zero; otherwise the sensor fault e predicted from UKFS and/or both e and   predicted from UKFA is nonzero. the actuator bias 

The system is considered to be faulty when either e derived from UKFS has  derived from UKFA is nonzero. In other words, a fault will be nonzero mean or  detected as a sensor fault by UKFS and as an actuator fault by UKFA in the meantime. To diagnose if the fault is a sensor fault or an actuator fault, a squared residual x is introduced, which is defined as

 x ( k ) = ( x ( k ) - x b ( k ) )T ( x ( k ) - x b ( k ) )

(3.55)

 into nonlinear function (2.21) where xb is the state variable calculated by substituting 

^ ,z ) xb ( k +1) = f (x b ( k ) , u ( k ) , b (k ) (k )

(3.56)

 is the actual actuator bias, the mean value of x should be equal to zero. However, If 

due to the dynamic error between the predicted actuator fault and the actual value, x will

be zero only when the system is steady. For most cases, when a dynamic actuator fault is under detection, x will be limited between zero and a threshold value. Otherwise, the mean of x will exceed the threshold, and e is the actual sensor fault. The value of the threshold needs to be selected by trial and error upon the control system tuning. When the

44

state vector x and actuator bias b are both bounded, x will also be bounded. The boundary is related to the boundary of x and b.

3.4 Simulation Results
Simulation studies have been conducted for the bleed air temperature control system, using dynamic equations and the UKF based fault detection and isolation method derived in the above sections. In the simulation, the measurement fault in load temperature sensor and actuator fault in bypass valve and ram air valve are considered. First a measurement noise in the load temperature sensor is introduced with variance Rv=0.01. The simulation duration is 100 seconds and the time step is typically 0.1 seconds. The mean of the squared residual x is calculated with the averaging period of 10 sampling points. The threshold of x is 0.2 °F2. The parameters and initial conditions are given to simulate an aircraft in cruising mode and are listed in Table 3.1. In the following figures (Fig. 3.3 to Fig. 3.7) the dashed line shows the real value of sensor or actuator fault, the dot-dashed line shows the threshold of x, and the solid line is the value of fault detected by the proposed UKF algorithm or the value of x .

Fig. 3.3 shows the simulation results for detecting a sensor measurement fault, which occurs at t=10 s and increases linearly to 2 °F at t=20 s. As shown in Fig. 3.3(a), an error e is detected by UKFS, with the same magnitude as the simulated sensor measurement fault. In Fig. 3.3 (b), the UKFA outputs an estimated value of valve  , which occurs at t=10 s and increases to 0.02 rad. According to the fault opening bias 

isolation algorithm stated in last section, the bypass valve opening bias detected by UKFA is not an actual fault because the mean of squared residual x (Fig. 3.3 (c)) keeps increasing and exceeds the threshold. Fig. 3.4 to Fig. 3.7 show the simulation results for detecting bypass valve and ram air valve actuator faults. As shown in Fig. 3.4 (b) and Fig. 3.5 (b), a valve opening bias is simulated, which occurs at t=10 s and increases linearly to 2% full opening range of the valve (0.0314 rad) within 10 seconds, and the estimated valve opening bias increases after the actuator fault occurs and converges to the actual value. In Fig. 3.6 (b) and Fig. 3.7 (b), a valve opening bias is simulated as a sine wave with the peak value of 2% full opening range of the valve (0.0314 rad), and the estimated value follows the change of the actual actuator bias. In Fig. 3.4(c), after the fault occurs, the mean of squared residual is limited within 0.2 (°F2), as well as in Fig. 3.5 (c) to Fig. 3.7 (c). According to the proposed fault isolation algorithm, the fault detected by UKFA is the actual actuator fault and the sensor measurement bias detected by UKFS (Fig. 3.4 (a) to Fig. 3.7 (a)) is not really a sensor measurement fault.

51

Remark: There is a trade-off between fault detection reliability and efficiency when it comes to the selection of a threshold for x. For example, as shown in Fig. 3.3 (c), if the threshold for x is 0.1 (°F2), the sensor fault could be isolated about 10 seconds earlier, but the bypass valve actuator fault will be misclassified as sensor measurement error because x exceed 0.1 between 30 and 40 seconds in Fig. 3.4 (c). The selection of the threshold value depends on many factors, such as the system modeling error, and needs to be selected by trial and error upon the control system tuning. In extreme cases, when the system response deviates substantially from its dynamic model, a fault may not be detected correctly. In practice, an FDI method may be enabled only during cruising flight mode of the aircraft, when the system dynamics can be modeled more accurately with minimum uncertain factors.

CHAPTER 4 HEAT EXCHANGER FOULING DETECTION

4.1

Fouling Detection Algorithm The fundamental concept of the proposed fouling detection method is that the

fouling severity of the heat exchanger can be reflected by the deviation of valve control command from normal values. A diagram of the proposed heat exchanger fouling detection method based on valve command signal is shown in Fig. 4.1. In the proposed fouling detection method, a reference model is introduced which represents the performance of a clean heat exchanger. The difference between the estimated load
^ temperature T load and actual load temperature Tload is defined as the estimation error

^ -T  =T load load

(4.1)

With the estimation error reaching to zero, a deviation of the actual valve opening
^bypass . And then the valve command command ubypass is obtained, which is denoted as u

for the reference fouling-free system model is
^ bypass = u bypass + u ^ bypass u

(4.2)

If there is no fouling in the heat exchanger, the actual bleed air system dynamics
^bypass is close to zero. If the fouling is matches with the reference model, and u

53

^bypass will deviate from zero and the magnitude of u ^bypass reflects the significant, u ^bypass will severity of fouling. In the following section, the valve command deviation u

be considered as a state variable and predicted by an extended Kalman filter (EKF), which is used as a state estimator.

Fig. 4.1 Diagram of heat exchanger fouling detection method

4.2

Residual Generation Using EKF In the modeling of heat exchanger, the ratios of the thermal capacities of the

masses of the two air streams to the thermal capacity of the core itself are negligibly small, and hence can be regarded as zero. A small capacity ratio means that the fluid transit or dwell time is small compared to the duration of the transient (Gvozdenac, 1986). The functional dependency of the model parameters' (i.e., the heat transfer coefficients) on mass flow rate reflects the dynamic behavior of the heat exchanger. Since the heat transfer coefficients are functions of mass flow rate, the model is nonlinear and the EKF is applied to the state estimation. The correlation equations for heat transfer coefficients

54

for realistic heat exchangers are employed here as determined by Equations (2.15) and (2.16). Measurements of the inlet and outlet temperatures and the flow rates provide the data for model state estimation with the EKF algorithm.

estimator becomes

(4.3 (a))

^bypass ( k +1| k ) = u ^bypass ( k ) + v ^b( k ) u

(4.3 (b))

The output equation is
^ ( k +1) = h(x ^ a ( k +1) , u( k +1) , z ( k +1) ) y

(4.4)

Equations (4.3) and (4.4) will be used as prediction and update functions in EKF, and are assumed to be continuously differentiable. The predicted estimate covariance is

P a ( k +1|k ) = F( k ) P( k ) F( k )T + Vb ( k )

(4.5)

where F is the state transition matrix and is given by

4.3 Effect of Fouling
In order to emulate the fouling effects, the heat exchanger internal tubes were lined with fouling, and tests were carried out after each layer of fouling was added. Three

56

cumulative layers of fouling were sprayed on to the internal structure of the heat exchanger in the hot air channels. The types of sprayed materials are listed in Table 4.1 .

The effect of heat exchanger fouling in bleed air temperature control system is studied with respect to cruising flight mode. The system can be considered operating in a steady state under this mode. The temperature and pressure drops are measured at constant flow rates and increasing fouling levels. Experiments were carried out for various rates of air flow. Bleed and ram air flow rates ranging from 0.01 ­ 0.06 lbm/s were tested. The inlet and flow conditions for which the tests were carried out are summarized in Table 4.2.

For tests A ­ E, with variations in hot and cold air mass flow rate and hot air inlet temperature, the change in flow temperature is observed for different levels of fouling. Therefore, increasing of fouling level has little effect on the outlet temperature response, under variant flow rates. As seen in Fig. 4.2, the outlet temperature does not change significantly with increasing fouling. The reason is that heat transfer rate is proportional to flow rate of air across the heat exchanger. In other words, if the flow rate through heat exchanger keeps constant, the heat transfer rate will not have significant change. Also, slight degradation in the heat transfer surface has no significant effect on the thermal performance of the heat exchanger, due to low thermal conductivity of air.

58

Air temperature drop (deg. F)

Test No .
Fig. 4.2 Bleed air temperature drop comparison of clean and fouling conditions

The relation between valve command signal and pressure drop increment through heat exchanger (as a result of fouling increase) is found with simulations and experiments for the same operating conditions listed in Table 4.3.
Table 4.3 Operating conditions for bypass control configuration

Thi = 135 °F Wbleed = 0.02 lb/s Phi= 16.2 psi

Tci = 70 °F Wram = 0.03 lb/s Kbypass =100(/2)

Tload_sp =86 °F Dbypass = 0.75 inch

As shown in Fig. 4.3 , the bypass valve opening command decreases with the increase of the pressure drop through the heat exchanger, which is caused by the increased fouling. The decrease of the bypass valve opening command can be explained as follow: the flow in bleed air (hot) side of heat exchanger is blocked with fouling, which leads to increased bypass channel flow and higher load temperature if the opening angle of bypass valve is not changed. To regulate the load temperature at the set point,
59

the bypass valve opening is decreased to reduce the flow through the bypass channel. The simulation well predicts experimental results despite of limited offset induced by modeling errors.

Fig. 4.3 Relationship of bypass valve opening command and pressure drop increment

From the results in Fig. 4.3, the effect of heat exchanger fouling in the bleed air system can be modeled as pressure drop increment through heat exchanger, which is defined as Pdroph for bleed air side and increases with accumulation of fouling. The hot side pressure drop for a fouled heat exchanger can be expressed as
Pdroph( f ) == Pdroph + Pdroph

CHAPTER 5 DEVELOPMENT OF TEST FACILITY AND EXPERIMENTS

5.1

Test Rig Design A test rig was developed at the Systems and Control Laboratory of Ryerson

University for the flow temperature control studies. Fig. 5.1 and Fig. 5.2 show the schematic layout and picture of the test rig, respectively. This test rig consists of one bleed air channel and a ram air channel. To simulate the engine bleed air, the air in bleed air channel is heated up to the required temperature with a 3 kW in-line heater. A bypass channel is split from the bleed air channel over the heat exchanger with an electrical control valve (CV2) installed. A temperature sensor is installed at the outlet of bleed air channel to measure the load temperature. Mass flow sensors, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, and manual valves are installed on the test rig. Main control elements and their locations in the test rig are listed in Table 5.1.

Fig. 5.1 Bleed air temperature control test rig configuration

61

Fig. 5.2 Picture of the test rig

There are two air sources in the experimental set up. The main air source is two parallel-connected high pressure tanks, each having a capacity of 51300 in3. The maximum pressure inside the tank is 100 psig, charged by a compressor. Although the compressor can continuously supply the compressed air to the tanks, the pressure of the air feeding to the test rig drops, depending upon the mass flow rate. To solve this problem, a control valve (CV3) is installed between the tanks and the test rig. The source air pressure for the test rig can be kept approximately constant by regulating this control valve. The second air source is a tank shared with other labs. It supplies air to the ram air channel. There are two size metal pipes in the test rig. The ¾-inch diameter pipe is used to fit the ¾-inch electrical control valves, which are used to regulate the air source inlet pressure, ram air flow rate and bypass flow rate. The 2-inch diameter pipe is used for
62

installing the flow sensor, because the sensor is too long to be installed in a ¾-inch diameter pipe. The command unit consist of a Pentium-D PC, a 16 bit A/D board ( PCI 6034E) and a 16 bit D/A board (PCI 6704), both manufactured by National Instruments, Co. The PC serves as the controller that sends out current commands to control valves and collects signals of pressures transducers, flow sensors, and temperature sensors.

5.2 Main Components
5.2.1 Heat exchanger The heat exchanger is the core part of the test rig. The high performance air to air heat exchanger (Fig. 5.3) is manufactured by Bell Intercoolers. The size of the heat exchanger core is 3.0"× 2.9"× 6" . Tanks are welded on four sides of the core for pipe connection. The plate-fin heat exchanger has four bleed air channels and four ram air channels, and it is safe to operate with a pressure under 100 psig.

Fig. 5.3 Air to air plate-fin heat exchanger, manufactured by Bell Intercoolers

For the experiments, parameters for the heat exchanger, such as heat transfer coefficient is unknown to the user and need to be identified. With the change of flow temperature and incremental of heat transfer, the overall heat transfer coefficients Hh and Hc are estimated as

64

Hh = Hc =

Wbleedmain C h (Tho - Thi ) ln (T2 / T1 ) T2 - T1

(5.1)

where T1 = Tho - Tci and T2 = Thi - Tco .

5.2.2

Heater and control systems An in-line air heater is installed at the inlet of bleed air channel. The 3 KW heater is

able to heat the flow up to 300 ºF (150 ºC) at the mass flow rate 0.04 lb/s. The inlet and exit temperature limits are 200 ºF (93 ºC) and 1400 ºF (760 ºC), respectively. The maximum air inlet pressure is 60 psig, which is lower than the maximum tank pressure. In order to protect the heater and insure users' safety, the heater inlet pressure is regulated below 60 psig. And no valve is installed downstream the heater so that the flow will not be blocked. The closed-loop heater control system contains a temperature controller, power controller, over-temperature protection, and a thermocouple, providing a constant output temperature regardless of changes in the airflow. The temperature controller also

provides a display of the process air temperature. Fig. 5.4 shows the heater and its controller. The manufacturer is SYLAVNIA.

Control valve The control valve (Fig. 5.5) is a ¾-inch brass ball valve driven by an

electromechanical actuator. Both the valve and actuator are manufactured by BI-TORQ, CARBO-BOND, Inc. The temperature rating for the valve is 297 ºF. The control valve used in the test rig has limited sensitivity to the input current. The valve "dead-zone" is about 0.2 mA when the valve keeps going in one direction and about 0.5 mA when the valve changes its movement direction.

Temperature sensor A Honeywell RTD temperature sensor (Fig. 5.6) is used. The response time of the

sensor is affected by the air flow rate. For the low flow rate used in the experiment, the response time is considered as a constant.

Flow sensor The air velocity transducer FMA-905 (Fig. 5.7) is manufactured by OMEGA Inc. It

utilizes both a velocity sensor and a temperature sensor to accurately measure air velocity V (in SFPM, standard feet per minute). To obtain mass flow rate W (lb/s) the SFPM velocity is multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the pipe A and air density :

W = VA

Pressure sensor Two types of pressure sensors, PX303 and PX209 (Fig. 5.8) are installed in the test

rig to operate in different temperature ranges. Pressure sensors PX303 are used to measure ram air inlet pressure and bleed air inlet pressure at the location before the heater where the operating temperature is relatively low. The inlet pressure of the valve and the load pressure are measured by PX209, a higher temperature pressure sensor. All the pressure sensors are manufactured by OMEGA Inc.

5.3 Experiments for Sensor and Actuator Fault Detection
The proposed UKF based fault detection and diagnosis method has been evaluated experimentally as shown in Fig. 5.9 and Fig. 5.10. The sampling period is 0.1 s, and the mean of the squared residual is calculated with the averaging period of 10 sampling points. The threshold of  x is set to 0.3 °F2 In the first experiment, a 2 °F bias is added on the measurement signal of load temperature sensor at 50 seconds. This bias is used to simulate sensor measurement fault. As shown in Fig. 5.9(a), the sensor fault detected by UKFS is around 2.5 °F. Since the mean of squared residual x exceeds the threshold after the fault occurs (Fig. 5.9(c)), the actuator fault obtained by UKFA ((Fig. 5.9(b)) is not really an actuator fault. In another experiment, a 2 mA is added to the command to the bypass valve at 50 seconds, which is equivalent to a 0.2 rad valve opening fault. As shown in Fig. 5.10(c), since the mean of squared residual x is within the threshold 0.3 ( °F2). The bypass valve opening bias, which is detected by the UKFA around 0.16 rad (Fig. 5.10 (b)), can be considered as a true actuator fault. In other words, the sensor measurement bias detected by UKFS (Fig. 5.10 (a)) is not an actual sensor fault. For the second experiment, the mean of squared residual does not converge to zero when the system is steady, because there is always an error between the predicted load temperature and the measured value. This error may be caused by many factors. First, the system dynamic model is not exact due to the assumptions made in Section II. Some system parameters may not be identified accurately. Second, heat loss through the metal pipes, and unmodeled disturbances may also cause some error.

5.4 Experiments for Heat Exchanger Fouling Detection

The experimental result for heat exchanger fouling detection is shown in this section. Fig. 5.11 shows the bypass valve command deviation as predicted using EKF for various fouling levels. The dashed lines are results of simulation. The values are listed in Table 5.2, which correspond to the experimentally determined bleed air pressure drop for different fouling levels. The solid lines in Fig. 5.11 represent the valve command deviation in experiments, which are measured when the system is steady. As shown in Fig. 5.11, the estimated deviation increases with the increase of the heat exchanger fouling level. In other words, the severity of fouling is reflected by this increase. A larger deviation indicates a higher level of fouling accumulated in the heat exchanger. In the experiments, the change of some operating conditions, e.g., the total bleed air flow rate, will cause the fluctuation of valve command deviation. If the change of operating condistions is small, the fluctuation of estimated valve command deviation will be limited by a threshold. In some situations, due to the linearization in EKF, the filter may diverge if the actual operating conditions are not near the initial values. The ram air flow rate is maintained constant in the bypass control configuration, and fouling in the ram air channel is not studied in this work, which can be done using the same concept that has been presented in this dissertation. For the ram air control configuration (Shang, Liu, & Hodal, 2010), the load temperature is regulated by a valve placed in the ram air channel to control the ram air flow rate. With fouling increasing in ram air channel, the ram air valve will be forced to open more to let enough air pass through the heat exchanger.

CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

6.1

Conclusions This dissertation presents proposed fault detection and diagnosis methods along

with simulation and experimental results on the simulated bleed air temperature control system. The system regulates engine bleed air temperature using cold ram air through a controlled heat exchanging process. Temperature sensing elements, air flow control elements, and heat exchanging elements constitute the key components for proper functioning of the temperature control system. It is desired that faults in these key components can be detected and identified without using expensive redundant devices. Therefore, analytical fault detection and diagnosis methods based on mathematical models attract great attention and become the focus of this dissertation. The analytical methods of fault detection and diagnosis require the equations that govern the system dynamics to be established before fault detection and identification algorithms can be applied. A nonlinear mathematical model of the bleed air system is developed in this dissertation with realistic assumptions. Dynamics of the key components (heat exchanger, temperature sensor and control valve) are modeled. Influence of major parameters, such as mass flow rate, pressure, and temperature, are investigated in numerical and experimental tests. The nonlinear model is discretized in the time domain for use as prediction and update functions in the fault detection and diagnosis algorithms.

74

In the proposed fault detection method, two unscented Kalman filters are derived for the bleeding air temperature control system and used to monitor the sensor and actuator respectively. The value of sensor measurement error is estimated by one UKF, which is denoted as UKFS. By adding actuator bias in the state vector, actuator fault is estimated by another UKF, denoted as UKFA. For the fault diagnosis, a squared residual x is defined. The type of fault (sensor fault or actuator fault) is determined by comparing the squared residual and a threshold. Selection of the threshold value is based on empirical criteria obtained from experiments with trade-off between fault detection reliability and efficiency. Convergence analysis shows that the proposed UKF is stable and convergent. The proposed sensor and actuator fault detection and diagnosis method is investigated by both simulation and experiment. Sensor fault and actuator fault were detected and the type of fault is correctly determined based on the selected value of squared residual. For the health monitoring of heat exchanger, a valve control command based heat exchanger fouling detection method is developed. The fouling severity of the heat exchanger was reflected by the deviation of valve control command from normal values. Studying the effects of velocity and temperature on the fouling process provided useful information with respect to the operation of heat exchanger. The heat transfer efficiency of the heat exchanger and the pressure drop through the heat exchanger at various fouling levels are investigated experimentally. It is found that the outlet temperature of the heat exchanger dose not change significantly with the increased level of fouling under the same operating conditions (air flow rate and inlet temperature); however a larger deviation between the actual valve opening angle and the command value is found in
75

higher lever fouling cases. It was demonstrated that the valve opening angle deviation can be used as an effective indicator of fouling for the heat exchanger.

6.2 List of Contributions
The main contributions of this dissertation are summarized as follows: 1. A nonlinear model for the bleed air system was developed and used for design and convergence analysis for the proposed fault detection and diagnosis method. 2. A UKF based FDD method was developed to detect and identify temperature sensor fault and valve actuator fault in a high performance aircraft bleed air temperature control system. 3. A heat exchanger fouling detection method was developed in which fouling was monitored by estimating the deviation of valve control command of an engine bleed air temperature regulation system in operation.
4.

The sensor and actuator fault detection and diagnosis method, and the heat exchanger fouling detection method were investigated on computer-controlled bleed air temperature control rest rig. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

6.3 Future Work

6.3.1

Limitations in the current work The current research is limited in terms of actual implementation. It is difficult to

build an experimental setup that exactly simulates the actual environment in an aircraft at cruising conditions. The heat loss from the bleed air temperature control system to the environment can hardly be quantified and precisely modeled. It is difficult to maintain a constant flow rate and a constant inlet pressure of the bleed air and ram air for a long duration. In addition, the fouling layers in a heat exchanger are not ideal. The thickness may vary along the flow channel since the foulant can only be sprayed from the inlet and the outlet. These facts are considered to be responsible for the difference between the simulations and the experiments on the heat exchanger. The steady-state error and small swing of the system response can be seen from the experimental results. It may be caused by many factors. First, the system model is not exactly the same the real system because of the assumptions made in Chapter 2. Second, some system parameters may not be identified accurately. The temperature errors and small variation may also be caused by sensor measurement error, heat loss through the metal pipes, and unmodeled dynamics of the control valves.

77

6.3.2

Suggestions for future work 1. To enhance the reliability of the aircraft bleed air temperature control system, a fault tolerant control system can be designed based on the sensor or actuator faults estimation developed in this dissertation. 2. Parameter identification of heat exchanger may be conducted to obtain a more accurate heat exchanger model. 3. The test rig may be improved for a longer duration with stable air supply so that longer experimental runs can be achieved.
