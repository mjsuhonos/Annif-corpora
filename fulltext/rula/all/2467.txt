GROUP 11 PINCER OXAZOLINE COMPLEXES

Mahroo Taghvaee Seighalani Master of Science, Molecular Science, Ryerson University, 2012

Abstract The synthesis and characterization of new copper pincer complexes via cyclometallation of potentially anionic pincer ligands with C1 point group symmetry is reported. All of these complexes have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction method, which confirms the proposed tridentate binding mode of pincer ligand and the formation of an amido N-Cu bond. The reactivity of two of the complexes was investigated towards C-C bond formation reaction, notably the Henry reaction. One of the complexes, which was derived from the achiral pincer ligand, is shown to be a suitable catalyst for the Henry reaction under the standard conditions. The Henry or nitroaldol reaction is one of the organic reactions which affords a C-C bond. The product of this reaction is a -nitro alcohol which is formed by addition of a nitroalkane to a carbonyl compound.

Introduction

1-Coordination Compound 1-1- Historical Background Studies and efforts on the preparation and characterization of what are now called coordination complexes, indeed, began in the nineteenth century.1 Wolcott Gibbs and Frederick Genth published their research on the synthesis of ammonia-cobalt compounds such as Co2(NH3)8(NO2)4(NO3)2 in 1857.2 Following that, in 1875, Sophus Mads Jørgensen, a Danish chemist, reported some investigations in the field of coordination chemistry and even was considered as an explorer in this branch of chemistry. He also deduced the molecular structure of CoCl3.6NH3 based on its freezing point and conductivity measurements.3 The octahedral

configuration concept based on coordination number six was the hypothesis of Alfred Werner.3 In 1893, he correctly proposed the chemical structure of [Co(NH3)6](Cl)3 in which a Co3+ ion is surrounded by six NH3 molecules in an octahedral geometry. The three chlorides are also involved in the overall complex as "free" (i.e., non-coordinated) counter-anions.4, 5 Coordination chemistry is, therefore, the study of the interactions between a central, often metal, atom(s) and a certain number of molecules or ions that are directly bound to the metal and referred to as ligand.

1

1-2- Ligands: General Ligand is defined as a molecule, element or ion which can have independent existence. This broad definition allows this term be used not only in chemistry, but also in molecular biology and biochemistry.1 In chemistry however, a ligand is a molecule or ion in which donation of electron density facilitates coordination to a central atom. It should be noted that the availability of at least one lone pair of electrons is often a key aspect for a species to act as a ligand. Many ligands include heteroatoms such as N, O, S and P as the source of these electrons. Halogen ions are also a common source of ligands for metal and non-metal atoms. Moreover, large numbers of organic fragments can act as ligands or have the potential to be converted (i.e., chemically modified) into ligands. One classic example of a ligand is the ammonia (NH3) molecule which formally has one lone pair of electrons and hence can bind to a central atom (M) through donation of these electrons to a formally empty orbital on M.1 However, ammonia is obviously not being considered to be a ligand until it is bound to such a central atom. The simplest coordination bond formation is represented in equation 1.

eq. 1

In another specific example ammonia acts as an electron donor to a metalloid acceptor (Ag+) to form what is often termed a "coordinate" or "dative" bond (Scheme1).1

Scheme 1. Formation of coordinated bond between ammonia and silver ion

1-2-1- Denticity and chelation Many ligands contain more than one atom that can offer lone pair electron in their structures. As a result, these ligands can bind via more than one site to the central atom. According to this classification, a bi-dentate ligand has two, tri-dentate has three and in general poly-dentate ligands have more than two sites in the ligand to bind to a metal centre. Chelation happens where the ligand offers more than one lone pair through different atoms to attach to the same metal centre. A chelate ring is formed when a potentially chelating ligand binds to a metal centre from the non-coordinated (acyclic) system to one in which two different atoms have donated electrons to a metallic centre. Figure 1 shows an example of the carboxylate group in different coordination modes.1

1-3- Pincer ligands Pincer ligands are classified as tridentate binding agents in which one formally anionic centre (which can be either a C atom or other element) is linked to two other electron donating groups. These latter systems usually involve N, P, O, S and/or Se as source of electron pairs. Scheme 2 indicates the general class of pincer type ligands.6

Scheme 2. Three general class of pincer ligands. (A) shows the general class of
aryl pincer ligand M is an element bound to anionic centre and L is the ligand attached to the metal centre, (B) represents the more general pincer in which an anionic central donor atom Y can be a C or other atom attached to two other E donor atoms. Structure (C) is the type pincer form in which the formal anion does not have the central position.6

The first synthesis of pincer-type ligands was reported by Bernard L. Shaw and his group (Reaction 1.3.1). They reported that 1,3-bis((di-tert-butylphosphino) methyl) benzene (3) can undergo metallation to provide a novel type of tridentate chelating functions (4) (Scheme 3).7

Reaction 1.3.1

Scheme 3. PCP pincer complex Pincer ligands have exhibited varied activities towards (transition) metals to generate the pincer complexes, various research groups have attempted the synthesis of these ligands. Distinct types of pincer ligands have been designed and synthesized by using either identical donor groups around the potential anionic centre or by altering the source of electron donors. As was mentioned earlier, a functional way of categorizing the various pincer ligands is based on the three atoms coordinating to the centre (transition metal), summarized as ''ECE''. For instance, in Scheme 2 with amino groups (E= NR2) on the ''side arms'' is referred to as a NCN complex and with phosphines (E= PR2) as a ''PCP'' complex. As a result, the combination of different electron donors can provide a variety of pincer ligand designs such as PCN, SCS, SCP, and SCN, etc.

5

However, the majority of research has been carried out with pincer ligands incorporating N, P and/or S donor atoms. Due to their ability to bind to (transition) metals, pincer ligands are receiving a lot of attention among the organometallic community. Pincer ligand complexes have been used as catalysts in organic synthesis because they can introduce regio- and enantioselectivity in the products of organic reactions that they promote.8 As a result, pincer complexes are becoming very useful frameworks for a number of diverse applications. These related functions are described in detail in ref. 9.

1-4- Methodology for the Metalation of Pincer Ligands

Since pincer metal complexes are attracting much attention, the strategies for metalation of these ligands have played a significant role in the synthesis of such complexes. Scheme 4 shows some of different classes of aryl pincer ligands which undergo the metalation to give metal complexes.10

6

Scheme 4. Metalation of pincer ligands

Various methods for the metalation of pincer ligands and synthesis of new complexes have been disclosed. These methodologies either can include the formation of M-C -bonds or formation of a new bond between metal and another source of anion. This will be described in more detail below.

1-4-1- Direct Cyclometalation Direct cyclometalation is a very effective method for the formation of a new bond between a (transition) metal and the potential anionic centre of pincer ligands (Figure 2).11-12

7

Figure 2. The direct cyclometallation reaction

This method has been successfully used since 1976 for the synthesis of various complexes of Groups 9 (Rh, Ir) and 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt) especially for the PCP-type pincers.10, 14-16 The reaction shown below (Reaction 1.4.1.1) is an example that demonstrates a pincer ligand 5 undergoing direct cyclometallation with RuCl2(PPh3)3 to afford complex 6.13

Reaction 1.4.1.1

Nevertheless, this method is not always a successful strategy for the metalation of pincer ligands. For example, as is shown in Reaction 1.4.1.2, compound 8 reacts with (COD)PtCl2 (7) (COD = cycloocta-1,5-diene) to affords the non-cyclometallated monometallic complex 9. Such materials have been considered as possible intermediates in the desired C-H and C-C bond activation processes.17

8

Reaction 1.4.1.2

1-4-2- Oxidative Addition The oxidative addition reaction has been used to explain a category of reactions which is critical in catalysis and organometallic chemistry.18 Oxidative addition reactions result in a change in the formal oxidation state and coordination number of a metal centre. This is a very useful method especially for substituted pincer ligands. For example, EC(X) E type of pincer ligands (where X = Cl, Br, I and E is a donor group like NR2) can be metalated via oxidative addition in cases where such precursors are resistant to direct cyclometalation (Figure 3).10

Figure 3. Oxidative addition to a pincer ligand

9

A variety of metal precursors have successfully been added to such ligands through the oxidative addition reaction to form pincer complexes. Some of the metal precursors that can be used for oxidative addition are including; [Ni(COD)2], (COD = cycloocta-1,5-diene), [Ni(PPh3)4], [Pd2(dba)3], (dba = dibenzylideneacetone), [Pt(4-tol)2(SEt2)]2, (4-tol = 4-methylphenyl), and [MCl(COE)2]n, (COE = cyclooctene) with M = Rh or Ir.19-21

1-4-3- Transcyclometalation The term transmetalation (TM), in general, is used to describe a type of organometallic or organic reaction in which ligands are formally transported or exchanged from one metal to another. Equation 2 (below) depicts the general form of a transmetalation reaction in which R and R' can be an alkyl, allyl, alkynyl, aryl, halogen or pseudo-halogen group and M1 and M2 are transition metals where M1  M2.

eq. 2

Trans-cyclometalation is a class of TM reaction which can be used as a method for formation of cyclometalated transition metal pincer complexes. Scheme 5 depicts the transcyclometalation (TCM) reaction with tridentate type of pincer ligands.10, 22

10

Scheme 5. Transcyclometalation reaction

The very first example of transcyclometalation reaction to form a pincer complex was reported in 1989 by Michel Pfeffer and his group that described the cyclopalladation reactions of several sulfur-containing pincer ligands.23 After that disclosure, several research groups have shown TCM reactions with various pincer ligands especially PCP and NCN type. For instance the TCM reaction of 10 with 11 affords 12 and [PtCl(PCP)] (13 : Scheme 6).22,24

Scheme 6. Transcyclometalation between PCP pincer ligand and NCN pincer complex

1-5- Oxazolines; a Small Ring with High Capability 2-Oxazolines (14b in Figure 4) are a sub-class of oxazole heterocycles (14a in Figure 4) which are a part of the azole family and consist of a five-membered nitrogen heterocyclic ring compound bearing at least one other non-carbon atom. This atom can either be nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen.

11

A 2-oxazoline ring has a single oxygen atom and a single nitrogen atom separated by a sp2hybridized carbon atom.25

Figure 4. Oxazole and 2-oxazoline

The synthesis of oxazolines was first described in 1884 by Rudolf Andreasch. The ring system itself was not, however, identified correctly at that time. Five years later, Sigmund Gabriel presented the accepted structure of an oxazoline ring.6 Oxazolines can be synthesized by various methods which are mentioned in the literature.25 A typical method involves the condensation of amino alcohols and carboxylic acids (Reaction 1.5.1) as one of the simplest and most inexpensive methods.26

Reaction 1.5.1

For this purpose, NH2 and OH groups of amino alcohol must be on adjoining carbon atoms and the carboxylic acid may either be aliphatic or aromatic.25,
26

However, the method

which was mentioned above (Reaction 1.5.1), does not generally afford good yields. For improving the yield, alkylnitryles (Reaction 1.5.2) can be used instead of carboxylic acids.26 12

Reaction 1.5.2

The oxazoline ring can be easily prepared from natural available amino acids and synthetic amino alcohols, it can be extensively used in many numbers of organic reactions. Oxazolines have also been widely employed in many fields of chemistry, it can be used as a protecting group, coordinating ligand and activation moiety. Moreover, the ligating group of oxazoline occurs naturally in unidentified classes of microbacterial iron chelators.27, 28

1-5-1- Pincer Oxazolines As mentioned earlier, oxazolines can be used as a building block for the synthesis of pincer ligands. Bis-oxazolines (box's) are one of the most popular classes of pincer ligands.29 These ligands (the general structure of bis-oxazolines is shown in the Figure 5) have two oxazoline rings in their structure which are separated by a spacer. In recent years box ligands have been widely used in asymmetric catalysis. Asymmetric catalysis, in general, includes of a cation (metal) coordinated to a ligand that is optically active and can produce a chiral compound.29 Pincer oxazolines have also shown strong binding affinity towards transition metals.6

13

Figure 5. Bis-oxazoline

Several methods have been demonstrated in the literature for the synthesis of pincer bisoxazolines.30, 31 One of the synthetic protocols for such synthesis is described in Scheme 7.32

Scheme 7. Synthesis of Bis-oxazoline

14

This method, however, has some difficulties in the isolation of final product. An alternative "one-pot" method that provides improved yields uses anhydrous zinc dichloride as catalyst and 1,3-dicyanobenzene as a starting material.33

Reaction 1.5.1.4

The synthesized bis-oxazoline can be used as a starting material for transmetalation reactions with both main group metalloid elements (e.g., tin) and transition metals.6 Nevertheless, the majority of the chemistry of the pincer bis-oxazoline ligand and its derivatives has been involved with asymmetric catalysis.34, 35

1-5-2- Pincer Ligands with ENE Donors A common aspect of all pincer ligands is the presence of a formal anionic source usually located on the central binding atom. This negatively charged atom tends to make a resulting complex more stable, particularly at higher temperatures. However, the source of this anion can be provided by atoms other than carbon. The Fryzuk group has reported several methods to synthesize pincer ligands with a N-H functionality as the source of such anions. One general formula of such ligand precursors is (R2PCH2SiMe2)2-NH.6 Fryzuk et al. has shown that 1,3-bis (chloromethyl)-tetramethyldisilizane (19) can be used as a starting material to synthesize such pincer ligands which are then used as precursors to bind to metals (Scheme 8)

15

Scheme 8. Synthesis of pincer ligand with N-H functionality

These "PNP"-type pincer ligands have been extensively developed and thus coordinated to Ni, Pd and Pt metal centres and then with other transition and main group metals.36- 40 Since then, several research groups have combined the ideas of Fryzuk with those of the bisoxazolines and hence designed and synthesized various bis-oxazoline derivatives containing other heterocycles such as carbazole, pyrrole and isoindoline. These latter ring systems contain a N-H bond as the potential source of an N-based anion (i.e., following de-protonation). Some examples of pincer ligands derived from such bis-oxazolines are shown in Figure 6.6, 41

16

Figure 6. Pincer ligands containing N-H bond

Work with these ligands, however, is not fully developed yet but their high affinity towards the transition metals and the variety of complexes that they afford, suggest that this new class of pincers will have a promising future in coordination chemistry.

1-5-3- Pincer Ligands with Low Molecular Symmetry Among the general category of PCP, NCN or NN'N pincers, only a few of them have idealized molecular point group symmetry lower than C2 (Figure 7).42- 45 Indeed, the achiral pincer ligands typically have higher molecular symmetry (Figure 8).42- 45

Figure 7. Pincer ligands with low symmetry

17

Figure 8. Symmetrical pincer ligand precursors

Oxazolines give an opportunity to elaborate both chiral and low symmetry ligand design methods. Pincer ligands with only a single (chiral or achiral) oxazoline ring have attracted much interest in recent years. Several research groups have described various synthetic methods to generate the ligands with formal C1 or Cs molecular symmetry. Motoyana et al. and Song and co-workers have reported the synthesis of PCN and NCN' types of pincer ligands which are of such low molecular symmetry. For example, [i-Pr-PhemoxOPPh2]Br (25) can be synthesized from isovanillin (23) in six steps. Compound 25 then affords 27 upon metalation. (Scheme 9).46

18

Scheme 9. Synthesis of low symmetry pincer ligand

Another example of an unsymmetrical NCN' pincer ligand is shown in Scheme 10 below. This molecule contains both an oxazoline and a pyrazole ring and can be synthesized from isophthaldehyde in three steps.47

19

Scheme 10. Synthesis of unsymmetrical NCN' pincer ligand

This potential pincer ligand (31) can undergo direct metallation with Pd(OAc)2 in refluxing acetic acid (HOAc) to form the NCN' pincer palladium complex 32 (Reaction 1.5.3.1).47

Reaction 1.5.3.1

20

1-5-4- N,N',N'' Pincer Oxazolines One advantage of using the oxazoline group for designing the N,N',N'' pincer ligands is the eligibility to induce both chirality and low symmetry at the same time. Since oxazolines have been shown to possess rich transition metal chemistry, design and synthesis of such ligands are attracting much interest. In many cases, enantioselective catalysis can result from the species which are containing such ligands.48 One of the important starting materials to the synthesis of N,N',N'' pincer oxazoline ligands which is relevant to this research project is 2-(2'-anilinyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazoline (34) in Reaction 1.5.4.1). Compound 34 can be easily formed by the reaction between isatoic anhydride (33) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol in the presence of ZnCl2 as a catalyst.47

Reaction 1.5.4.1

Another ligand which has been used in this research as a chiral starting material is; (+)-indanyl(2'-aminophenyl)-2-oxazoline (36). This compound can likewise be synthesized from the (1R, 2S)-cis-1-amino-2-indanol (35) under the same protocols as ligand 34 (Reaction 1.5.4.1.2).47

21

Reaction 1.5.4.2

Both 34 and 36 have been used as the starting materials in the synthesis of both chiral 38 and achiral 39 low symmetry pincer oxazolines previously48 and as a portion of this research project.

1-5-4-2- N-(2-(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-yl)phenyl)picolinamide (38) As mentioned above, research focusing on low symmetry pincer ligands has increased due to the fact that they can be used in enantioselective catalysis. Decken, Gossage and Yadav previously described one such formally C1-symmetric amide pincer ligand featuring an oxazoline and a pyridine group as the potential binding functionalities.48 N-(2-(4,4-Dimethyl-4,5-dihydrooxazol2-yl)phenyl)picolinamide (38) can be synthesized via amide coupling of 34 with picolinic acid (37) (Reaction 1.5.4.2.1).48

Reaction 1.5.4.2.1

22

1-5-4-3(39)

N-(2-((3Ar,8As)-8,8a-dihydro-3aH-indeno[1,2-d]oxazol-2-yl)phenyl)picolinamide

In a same fashion as 38, 39 can be synthesized upon amide coupling in presence of DCC and DMAP as coupling agents (Reaction 1.5.4.3.1).48

Reaction 1.5.4.3.1

Both ligands 38 and 39 have shown to easily deprotonate on the reaction with Pd precursor to generate Pd-amido complexes (Reaction 1.5.4.3.2).48 These materials contain a formally anionic pincer with the negative charge located at the central N-atom.

Reaction 1.5.4.3.2

1-6- Objective of Project The cornerstone of this work presented in this thesis involves the study of coordination chemistry of oxazoline pincer ligands with Group 11 transition metals and study of their catalytic activities toward C-C bond formation. This work entails a study of alternative synthetic methods that are applied to synthesis of copper and gold pincer complexes. Following this discussion, the molecular structure of synthesized complexes will be described. At the end, the catalytic activity of some of the complexes was tested in the Henry reaction.

Chapter Two

Copper
A large number of chemical structures that are found in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) are transition metal complexes containing copper. 49, 50 Despite the fact that the +2 oxidation state of copper is the most common one, other oxidation states including +1, +3 and +4 are known as well.49, 51 The number of reviews in which copper (II) compounds have been summarized is numerous;52-55 however, those which are specifically focused on Cu-pincer complexes are not well developed. The systems which will be discussed in this thesis are primarily four- and five-coordinated copper (II) pincer complexes containing an oxazoline ring. 2-1- General Aspects of Tetra-and Penta- coordinate Copper (II) Compounds There are almost six hundred examples of datasets found in the CCDC which are crystal structure of tetra-coordinated copper (II) compounds reported in the literature.49 Two idealized configurations are generally observed with this coordination number: square planar and tetrahedral and these two geometries occur in most cases with some degrees of distortion.51 One of the factors that can cause the distortion in the complexes is the size of ligand (sterics) and its denticity. Moreover, both electronic and steric hindrance of the coordinated atoms plays a significant role in the value of the of L-Cu-L bond angles found in such metallocycles (Figure 9).
49

The difference in covalent radii of the donating atoms can also cause differences in the value

of such angles. For example, in copper complexes with coordination number four (Figure 9).56, 57 and the donor atoms are oxygen (radii [r] = 0.73 Å) mean value of the L-Cu-L intra ligand angle () is approximately 64°, for nitrogen (r = 0.75 Å), sulphur (r = 1.02 Å), and selenium (r = 1.16 Å) donors this angle is 67°, 77° and 79° respectively.49

Figure 9. General structure of four coordinated copper complexes

Copper complexes with coordination number five are less common than those with coordination number four. However, the number of fully characterized copper complexes with coordination number five is still over five hundred.49, 51 Two general types of geometries have been observed for this coordination number: idealized square pyramidal around the metal centre, which is more common and trigonal bipyramidal. In five coordinated systems (Figure 10), perfectly squarepyramidal geometry (Figure 10a) is associated with  = 90º and  = 180°. For ideally trigonal bipyramidal geometry (Figure 10b),  is 90º and  becomes 120°.

An examination of structurally characterised five-coordiate Cu(II) systems reveals that 49 of these two geometries, generally, the mean value of apical Cu-L bond lengths in these complexes are larger than the equatorial Cu-L bond distances. This value rises in the order of: 1.974 Å (N) < 1.976 Å(O) < 2.273 Å (S) < 2.285 Å (Cl) < 2.408 Å (Br) < 2.563 Å (I). For example; when L is nitrogen, Cu-N (equatorial) bond lengths (mean value) are approximately 2.01 Å vs. 2.25 Å for the corresponding apical Cu-L bond lengths.49 As is seen with the tetra-coordinated Cu(II) complexes, both steric and electronic effects of the ligands are significant parameters leading to the opening of the L-Cu-L bond angles in the metallocyclic ring complexes. No matter which geometry is taking place around the metal centre, this amount increases when the metallocyclic ring gets larger.49, 58 2-3- Synthesis and Properties of Copper Amido Complexes A major application of Cu compounds is the role that they play as industrial catalysts and their known roles in biochemical activity.49 Amide (NR2-) base ligands (Scheme 11) have been extensively used for preparation of transition metal complexes particularly in the field of coordination and bioinorganic chemistry.59-62 For example, some symmetrical bis(amino acids) (Scheme 12) have shown strong coordination activities towards copper(II) ions. Resulted copper complexes such as (42 in Scheme 12) play a key role in bioinorganic chemistry.63

27

Scheme 11. Tetradentate ligands containing amide group

Scheme 12

The research described in this chapter is focused mainly on the synthesis of Group 11 (copper especially) halide and pseudo-halide amido pincer complexes containing a single oxazoline unit. As stated earlier, (oxazoline) pincer ligands potentially can bind to a transition metal to make a complex. One of the advantages of using Cu in order to study complexation behaviour is that there is a possibility that copper halides could be used directly for metallation of pincer ligands described previously. This would involve N-H bond activation, which is technically easier than C-H bond activation, and the likely formal loss of HX. Hence, there

28

would be no need for any special metal precursors as copper(II) halides are readily available starting materials. This is in contrast to other pincer complexes such as those of Groups 9 and 10.64, 65-70

2-3-1- Synthesis of Complex 38a The synthesis of amide 38 was performed according to Reaction 1.5.4.2.1 using the in situ produced (SOCl2) acid chloride derivative of picolinic acid 37, followed by low temperature addition of 34. In a solution of 1 equiv. of ligand 38 in EtOH (95%) was added 1 equiv. of CuCl2.2H2O according to reaction (2.3.1.1). The green coloured mixture was then stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction content was then filtered through a filter paper and then all volatiles were removed in vacuo. This process yielded the product 38a as a green powder. .According to the previous work involving Pd precursors,48 deprotonation of the N-H group is a possible reaction pathway. The IR data of compound 38a indicated the possible presence of a C-N stretching vibration at 531 cm-1. The absence of the N-H stretching band at 3309 and 3280 cm-1 suggested the formation of 1:1 adducts of ligand fragments with Cu2+. In addition, the UV-Vis spectra of the compound 38a exhibited only one absorption band for this compound at 342 nm ( = 7792 dm3mol1-cm-1) which is presumably due to ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) transitions. This absorption band suggested the presence of Cu2+ species in the complex. To confirm the structural nature of this complex, however, a single crystal X-ray diffraction study was carried out on the synthesized species.

29

Reaction 2.3.1.1

A molecular representation of compound 38 is found in Figure 11. The X-ray diffraction data for complex 38a is summarized in Table 2.1

Table 2.1. Summary of X-ray diffraction data of 38a Formula weight Formula Temperature (K) Crystal system Space group Unit cell dimensions: a(Å) b(Å)  (°) c(Å) Volume ( Å 3) Z 393.32 C17 H16 Cl Cu N3 O2 150 Orthorhombic Pna21 12.5234(3) 14.3114(6) 90.00 18.1160(8) 3246.9(2) 8

30

The results indicate that 38a is a monocopper complex strongly suggesting that it incorporates deprotonated 38. The coordination sphere is completed by the presence of a single metal-bound Cl atom which occupies a position trans to the amido donor. Of note is the formal amido-Cu interaction in addition to the coordination of both pyridine and oxazoline groups forming fiveand six-membered rings. The coordination geometry around the Cu atom is best described as distorted square planar in nature. Describing the structures of four-coordinated copper(II) complexes, however, can be a subjective endeavour especially when the structure is intermediate between the two most common four-coordinated geometries which are tetrahedral and square planar. To determine the geometry around the metal centre the tao parameter, which was introduced by Addison, Reedijk and coworkers in 1984, can be helpful. 71 This uses an empirical method based on bond angles to give a percentage of distortion and consequently a clear empirical method can be used to distinguish how close one particular structure is to the ideal extremes. In a transition metal complex with coordination number five (henceforth 5) this value, can be calculated using the two largest bond angles in the complex to give an index of the degree of trigonality (equation. 3).72

5 =

- 60

eq. 3

This value for ideal trigonal bipyramidal structure with D3h symmetry is 1.000; while an ideal square pyramidal structure with C4v symmetry is zero (0.000).72, 73

31

Similarly, R. P. Houser et al. proposed a simple geometry index for four-coordinated complexes inspired by Addison and Radjeek five-coordinated 5 index (equation 4).72

eq. 4

This parameter in the four-coordinated species for a perfect tetrahedral geometry is 1.000 and for the perfect square planar is 0.000.72 Calculated 4 parameter for complex 38a is 0.310 which is obviously closer to 0.000 than to 1.000 Therefore, the coordination geometry around the Cu atom is best described as distorted square planar which might be expected since the copper (II) is d9 and therefore possess an unpaired electron which can cause distortion according to the Jahn-Teller effect. Jahn-Teller distortion happens when the degenerate orbitals occupied unevenly in nonlinear molecules. Therefore, to reach to lower energy and being more stable the whole system distors. In the structurally characterized complex 38a, the Cu-Npyridine(1)B, Cu-Namide(2)B and CuNoxazoline(3)B bond lengths are 1.994(5), 1.941(5) and 1.980(5) Å respectively. The Cu-Namide distance, however, is the shortest among the all three Cu-N bond lengths in the molecule. This difference may be attributed to the anionic coordination from the deprotonated Namide donor as opposed to the neutral donation from the pyridine and oxazoline groups. The pyridine nitrogen Cu-N and the oxazoline nitrogen Cu-N bond lengths in the complex 38a are similar in magnitude to the corresponding distances in complex [CuBr(pyoxaL)2]Br·H2O (pyoxal: 2-pyridinyl-2oxazoline) which are 2.011(4) and 2.169(4) Å respectively.74 The amido nitrogen Cu-N bond

32

length is also comparable to an observed bond in the copper (II) complex containing tetradentate pyridine-based which is 1.921(2) Å.75 The average Cu-N bond length, however, with this ligand set is 1.979 Å which is typical for tetracoordinated copper (II) metal centres with an N, N', N'', Cl ligand set.49 The observed Cu-Cl bond length is 2.2318 Å. This bond length is close to the corresponding Cu-Cl bond distance in complex [Cu(2,6-bis(diisopropylaminomethyl)pyridine)Cl]2CuCl4 (in which copper has the coordination number four with one Cl trans to the pyridine nitrogen) which is 2.1970(6) Å.76 The observed Cu-Cl bond length in complex 38a is also in the expected range for Cu-X bond distance. The N(2)B-Cu-Cl(1)B and N(1)B-Cu(1)B-N(3)B bond angles are 157.22(16) and 153.7(2)° respectively. These values indicate that there is a distortion from ideal (180°) square planar geometry around the metal centre.

2-3-2- Synthesis of Complex 38b A similar reaction, as described above, involving anhydrous CuBr2 and 38 afforded green coloured powder as product. The reactivity of 38 and CuBr2 in the reaction 2.3.2.2 clearly demonstrates the similarity of 38 in coordination with copper halides precursors. The corresponding Br analogue, 38b, thus appears to be structurally and spectroscopically similar to the complex 38a. The IR spectrum of 38b is dominated by the absorbances typical of the compound 38 with the absence of N-H stretching band at 3309 and 3280 cm-1. Elemental analysis data are also consistent with the proposed structure for 38b.

Reaction 2.3.2.2

UV-Vis spectra of the compound 38b showed only one absorption band at 348 nm ( = 8022dm3mol-1cm-1). This absorption band also suggested the presence of Cu2+ species in the complex. The molecular structure of compound 38b (Figure 12) was confirmed with X-ray crystallography. As the X-ray result indicated, complex 38b demonstrated a distinct similarity to the compound 38a. Complex 38b crystallises in the Pna21 space group with eight molecules in

34

the unit cell. Cell angles (,  and ) are all 90° and cell lengths (a, b and c) are 12.5856(6), 14.4922(7) and 18.1596(6) Å respectively. The Cu-Npyridine(1), Cu-Namide(2) and Cu-Noxazoline(3) bond lengths are 1.998(6), 1.945(6) and 1.970(6) Å, respectively. Theses bond lengths are very similar in magnitude to the corresponding distances in complex 38a. It is also observed that the Cu-Namide has the shorter distance among the Cu-N bond lengths in the complex. As expected, the Cu-Br bond length (2.3669 Å) in compound 38b is slightly (0.1489 Å) longer than the Cu-Cl bond length in complex 38a. This difference is possibly due to the larger atomic radius of Br versus Cl. The Cu-Br distance in the complex 38b is to some extent close to the Cu-Br bond length (2.401Å) which is reported for the complex [CuBr(pyoxaL2)2]Br·H2O (pyoxaL: 2pyridinyl-2- . oxazoline).75 As expected, the geometry of this compound is also distorted square planar as discussed earlier. A complete list of structure factors, bond lengths and bond angles can be found in Appendix B.

Figure 12: ORTEP view of complex 38b

35

2-3-3- Synthesis of Complex 38c A procedure similar to that used to make 38a and 38b was employed in the synthesis of the complex 38c. Thus, 1 equiv. of 38 was dissolved in EtOH (95%) and 1 equiv. of Cu(BF4)2·6H2O was then added directly, as blue coloured crystals to this mixture at room temperature. The formation of large quantities of a green precipitate was noted almost immediately. After 12 h, the reaction content was filtered through filter paper and yielded a green coloured powder which was washed with diethyl ether and dried in the open atmosphere (reaction 2.3.3.1).

Reaction 2.3.3.1

Elemental analysis of this compound matched the expected structure. The infrared spectrum of compound 38c was consistent with its chemical formula as determined by elemental analysis and further confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The very strong and broad peaks at approximately 3400- 3200 cm-1 in the vibration spectra rose from O-H stretching of either coordinated or uncoordinated water molecules. UV-Vis spectra of the compound 38c showed only one absorption band at 344 nm ( = 6772 dm3mol-1cm-1). As expected, this absorption band suggested the presence of Cu2+ species in the complex.

36

Suitable crystals of compound 38c belong to the monoclinic P21 space group. X-ray diffraction analysis of this compound showed that 38c (Figure 13) is a mononuclear compound in which the copper atom is coordinated by three nitrogen atoms from the pincer ligand and one water molecule with BF4- as counter anion and a non-coordinated water molecule. One notable feature in this structure, however, is that copper (II) adopts coordination number five in the solid state (Figure 14). The fifth coordination site (apical) of the copper centre is occupied by the oxygen atom of a neighboring amide group. The calculated value of 5 (eq. 3) is 0.392 and the coordination environment of copper atom is distorted square-pyramidal from an idealized square-pyramidal geometry (in the solid state).

Figure 13. The ORTEP view of compound 38c

37

Figure 14: ORTEP view of overall structure of complex 38c The Cu-Owater(3)A bond length is 1.971(3) Å which is expected for Cu-O bond distances.49, 77 The Cu-Oamide(1)A bond length, being 2.298(2) Å, is much longer than that of typical Cu-O bond distances. As expected, the average of Cu-L(apical) bond lengths in the square-pyramidal geometry are generally longer than those of the equatorials.49 The Cu-N distances of Cu-N(1)A, Cu-N(2)A, and Cu-N(3)A are 2.003(3), 1.953(3) and 1.988(3) Å respectively which are normal and consistent with those corresponding Cu-N bond lengths in of known complexes.74- 76 A complete list of structure factors, bond lengths and bond angles of complex 38c can be found in Appendix B.

38

2-3-4- Synthesis of Complex 3d The synthesis of complex 38d was accomplished using two different starting materials. In route A (reaction 2.3.4.1); 1 equiv. of complex 38a was dissolved in THF and then followed by adding 1 equiv. of AgNO3. The formation of a white precipitate(AgCl) was noticed after adding the silver nitrate.

Reaction 2.3.4.1

The white precipitate then was removed from the reaction content by filtration through filter paper. The remaining green coloured mixture then stirred for a further 4 h at room temperature. The mixture then was filtered by gravity filtration and all volatile components were removed by rotary evaporation. Compound 38d was then obtained as green coloured powder. In route B, 1 equiv. of Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O was added to the solution of 1 equiv. of 38 in the EtOH at room temperature. Formation of green precipitate was noted during this time. Stirring then continued for 12 h and after that reaction content filtered through a filter paper. The resulted green coloured powder was washed by diethyl ether and dried in an open atmosphere (Reaction 2.3.4.2).

39

Reaction 2.3.4.2

The infrared spectra of compound 38d shows the strong and broad features at approximately 1560- 1330 cm-1 which is related to N-O stretching and bending frequencies of a coordinated nitrate molecule78. The IR results are consistent with its chemical formula as determined by elemental analysis. UV-Vis spectra of the compound 38d indicated only one absorption band at 348 nm ( = 15312 dm3mol-1cm-1). As expected, this absorption band suggested the presence of Cu2+ species in the complex. The molecular structure of 38d was confirmed by a single crystal X-ray analysis (Figure 15). Suitable crystals of complex 38d belong to the monoclinic P21/c space group with two molecules in the unit cell. Cell angles (,  and ) are 90.00, 100.0840(15) and 90.00 º and cell lengths (a, b and c) are 7.7793(3), 19.9956(5) and 10.9433(3) Å respectively.

40

Figure 15: ORTEP view of complex 38d

One notable feature in this structure is that Cu centre has coordination number of six. The copper atom in the 38d is coordinated by three nitrogen atoms (one pyridine nitrogen atom, one amide nitrogen and one oxazoline nitrogen atom), two nitrate oxygen atoms and sixth coordination site is occupied by the amide oxygen atom of another molecule in the unit cell. The Cu-N distances at the equatorial positions are 1.983(3), 1.969(2) and 1.952(2) Å respectively. These bond lengths are comparable with the Cu-N distances in the six coordinate complex [Cu(NO3)(MeOH)(L4)](NO3) in which these lengths are 1.983(4), 2.003(5) and 1.988(5) Å.79 The average value of Cu-N bond lengths is, indeed, normal and consistent with those corresponding Cu-N bond lengths in known complexes.7476

The Cu-Onitrate(3) bond length is

2.016(2) Å which is typical for Cu-O distances1 but Cu-Oamide(1) bond length (2.827 Å) is, however, longer in comparison to other Cu-O distances in the literature.1, 79 This suggests that

41

the Cu-O(1) interaction can be neglected. Thus the structure of compound 38d may also be viewed as a distorted trigonal bipyramidal since the calculated 5 (eq. 3) value for this complex is 0.87. A complete list of structure factors, bond lengths and bond angles of complex 38d can be found in Appendix B.

2-3-5- Synthesis of Complex 39a The chiral amide analogue 39 was prepared using PA (picolinic acid) and 36 under DCC-DMAP protocols (reaction 1.5.4.3.1, also experimental section). 48 The synthesis of compound 39a was achieved dissolving 1 equiv. of 39 in EtOH (95%) followed by adding equimolar of CuCl2.2H2O at room temperature (Reaction 2.3.5.1).

Reaction 2.3.5.1

42

Formation of light green coloured precipitate was observed during the reaction. The resulting light green coloured product was then filtered through filter paper, washed with diethyl ether and dried in the open atmosphere. The elemental analysis of compound 39a, in combination with IR and UV-Vis data, strongly suggests the formation of a 1:1 adducts of the ligand fragments with Cu2+; specifically, loss of the IR stretching frequency assigned to the amide N-H implies the formation of an amido complex. To confirm the molecular structure of this complex a single crystal X-ray diffraction study was carried out. A molecular representation of this material is found in Figure 16.

Figure 16: ORTEP view of complex 39a

43

According to the X-ray data, mononuclear complex 39a strongly suggests that it incorporates deprotonated 39. Similar to the complex 38a, the coordination sphere is completed by the presence of a single metal-bound Cl atom which occupies a position trans to the amido donor. According to the 4 value (0.110) this complex is considered as slightly distorted square planar. The N(3)-Cu-N(1) and N(2)-Cu-Cl bond angles are 171.26 and 172.25º, respectively. These angles have a slight deviation from the 180º in the ideal square planar geometry. The Cu-N bond lengths in this complex are very similar in magnitude to the corresponding bond lengths in complex 38a. The Cu-Cl bond distance (2.2289Å) is slightly shorter than the same bond length in the complex 38a. All Cu-N and Cu-Cl bond lengths, nevertheless, are typical for copper nitrogen and copper halogen bond distances. A complete list of structure factors, bond lengths and bond angles of complex 39a can be found in Appendix B. As it can be seen in Figure 17, 39a is square planar for the directly attached groups. However, in the solid state, which is shown in Figure 16, is square pyramidal due to the intermolecular bond (2.506Å) between the Cu(II) centres and the O of an adjacent amide group. This bond length, however, is comparable to the typical Cu-O distances.79 Since Cu(II) is well-known to form both 4- and 5- coordinated species, this type of behaviour is unsurprising.

2-4- An Introduction to Synthesis of Gold Pincer Complexes Group 11 metal complexes have been known as catalyst in various organic reactions, it was of interest to examine these with our materials. Au(I) and Au(III) species ,as catalysts, have attracted attention due to their versatility of applications that can be performed.80 AuCl3, which has been known as the most employed gold (III) catalyst, is a very hygroscopic, light sensitive, acidic and to some extent powerful oxidant species. Recently, however, the number of coordination and organometallic compounds has increased to offer some other alternatives to AuCl3.80- 82 R. V. Parish and his group have reported the synthesis of new complexes of [AuCl2L], in which L is a chelating agent containing a phenyl group with a N-donor substituent such as an oxazoline or dimethylaminomethyl group (Scheme 13).83,84

Scheme 13. Gold pincer complexes

45

In another paper published by G. van Koten and his group describes the synthesis of a bis-(ortho-amine) aryl-gold(I) complex. The reaction of [AuCl(PPh3)] with [Li(NCN)] at -20°C in diethyl ether led to formation of the desired product in a good yield. This compound can further react with AuCl3 at room temperature to afford the pincer type complexes (Reaction 2.4.1). 85

Reaction 2.4.1

2-4-1-Gold complexes containing oxazoline ring As it was mentioned previously, compounds containing a (chiral and/or achiral) oxazoline ring are becoming one of the most useful classes of catalysts in wide range of metal-catalyzed transformations. Nonetheless, gold derivatives bearing oxazoline containing ligands have not been extensively studied.84 According to the research that has been done by A. Corma and his group, reaction of commercially available bis-[(4R)-phenyl-2-oxazoline-2-yl]pyridine (Pybox) and an aqueous solution of NaAuCl4 affords an unexpected ring-opened complex in which Au is coordinated to the nitrogen of pyridine and the nitrogen of ring opened oxazoline. This behaviour reveals that these molecules are affected easily by Lewis acids (especially gold species) under the certain experimental conditions (Reaction 2.4.1.1).86

46

Reaction 2.4.1.1

Another synthesis of gold (III) derivatives was reported by an Italian research group in which pyridinyl-oxazolines(Pyox) have been used as ligand precursors (Reaction 2.4.1.2).80

Reaction 2.4.1.2

It has been seen that a further reaction of corresponding Au complex (43) with AcONa in order to generate the mononuclear dihydroxo- or dinuclear-oxo complexes did not work and yielded in a ring open product 46 (Reaction 2.4.1.3).

47

Reaction 2.4.1.3 Since this reaction (2.4.1.4) occurs in aqueous solution, the hydrolysis of [Au(pyox)Cl2]+ (43) to give mono(hydroxo) complex is the first step (Reaction 2.4.1.4).80

Reaction 2.4.1.4

Complex 45 it has been proposed that undergoes nucleophilic attack by OH- at the 5-position of the oxazoline ring to give the intermediate 45a which affords complex 46 after a condensation reaction (scheme 14).80

48

2-4-2-Synthesis of Complex 38f Several reactions were carried out in a same fashion as that of copper aimed to explore the coordination reactivity of pincer ligand 38 towards gold. One equiv. of 38 was dissolved in EtOH and followed by adding 1 equiv. of AuBr3 at room temperature. The dark orange coloured solution was stirred for 12 hours. The reaction contents were then filtered through filter paper and the resulting clear orange solution was left in an open atmosphere to evaporate all of the volatile components. Dark orange coloured solid was then formed. The IR spectrum of the obtained product is characterized by the presence of medium peaks at approximately 3300 and 3130 cm-1 which can be assigned to the N-H groups. The resulting compound was then characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The main feature of its
1

H-NMR spectrum is a slight downfield shift of all resonances of both the aromatic and

oxazoline ring protons. The aromatic signals are found between 7.22 and 9.00 ppm. The oxazoline ring signals are at 1.69 and 4.61 ppm. Integration of the signals are consistent with the structure assigned to 38f. The crystal structure of compound 38f was then determined by X-ray diffraction methods to clarify the structural nature of this material. Since gold(III) usually shows square-planar geometry83, 87 it was expected to afford a complex such as 38f', as it outlined in the Scheme 15. The X-ray results show that in this case, the product of this reaction is in fact a ringopened ammonium-ester cation 38f with AuBr4- as anion.

49

Scheme 15. Formation of compound 38f

The molecular structure of 38f consists of two discrete AuBr4- units, one water molecule and the ammonium cation (Scheme 15 and Figure 18). The crystal system is determined to be triclinic and of space group P1. A complete list of structure factors, bond lengths and bond angles of complex 38f can be found in Appendix B.

50

Figure 18: The molecular structure of Complex 38f

The proposed mechanism of the reaction,80 leading to 38f is shown in scheme 16 and involves nucleophilic attack of the intermediate 47 by a second nucleophile (e. g. H2O) which eventually leads to an ammonium intermediate 48 following the ring opening reaction.

51

Scheme 16. Plausible mechanism for formation of ring-open oxazoline

Reaction of ligand 38 with gold(III) bromide under basic condition, using 3 equiv of triethyl amine, also afford the same ring-open product. It is noted that by changing the nucleophile from water to a triethyl amine the product still remained unchanged. On the basis of these results here, sensibility to water, acid and base should be considered when using gold precursors in metalation of pincer ligands containing oxazoline rings.80, 88

Chapter Three 3-1- Catalytic Activity of Oxazoline Complexes in Organic Reactions Transition metal complexes, in general, have been widely used as catalysts in many organic and polymer syntheses.89-91 Wilkinson's catalyst; ((PPh3)3RhCl) and Vaska's complex;

(Ir(PPh3)2Cl(CO)) two some of the famous and classic examples of transition metal complexes. Complexes containing a chiral oxazoline ring, have attracted interests as catalyst in a wide range of metal-catalyzed reactions and transformations.92 Chiral compounds (a chiral compound is an object that is not identical to its mirror image) are very important in biological systems, pharmaceutical industry, organic and inorganic chemistry as well as biochemistry. The role of chirality in the pharmaceutical industry is crucial because different enantiomers or diastereomers have different biological activities.89 Therefore, design, development and synthesis of asymmetric catalysis is very important since a small amount of catalyst can promote reactions and lead to the generation of chiral products.89 A large number of these ligands can be synthesized from available chiral amino alcohols. As a result, the enantiocontrolling stereocentre exists on the carbon atom adjacent to the coordinated nitrogen of the oxazoline ring, and hence, it can be close enough to the metal active site to have a direct effect on the stereochemistry of the products.92 3-2-Nitro-Aldol (Henry) Reaction The Henry reaction (which was discovered in 1895)93 is one of the useful organic reactions that have been used for the formation of C-C bond.94, 95 The product of this reaction is a -hydroxynitroalkane that can be used as a starting material in the synthesis of many valuable building blocks such as amino alcohols,96 nitro alkenes and carbonyl compound like nitroketones (Scheme 17).89 53

Scheme 17. Henry reaction

The applicability of this reaction depends on the type of catalyst which is used in the reaction. Choosing a suitable reaction is very critical to generate the stereogenic centre.93 The initial research results on the asymmetric version of the nitroaldol (Henry) reaction have been reported by Shibasaki in 1992. They showed that rare earth metal alkoxides can be applied as catalysts (Reaction 3.2.2).97

Reaction 3.2.2

Since then, several research groups have developed and tested new transition metal complex systems which contain the oxazoline unit in their structures. Evans and Jørgensen have showed Cu complexes containing bis-oxazoline ligand (Figure 19) that can be used as catalyst in the Henry reaction under the conditions which are outlined in Reactions 3.2.3 and 3.2.4.98, 99

There are many other examples have shown that the combination of various chiral ligands and metal ion, especially Cu(II), can catalyze the Henry reaction.91,99-101

3-3- Study of Catalytic Activities of Novel Cu(II) Pincer Complexes in The Henry Reaction Chiral complexes of copper have been found to be a suitable catalysts for the Henry reaction,102 the novel Cu(II) pincer complexes synthesized here were tested as catalysts in this reaction. In order to obtain optimized conditions, the achiral complexes 38a and 38c have been examined as catalysts in a series of solvents such as THF, EtOH, toluene, DCM and chloroform (Table 3.1). Henry reaction between benzaldehyde and nitromethane in combination with 38a is described in the Reaction 3.3.1 below.

56

Reaction 3.3.1

As it can be seen in the reaction, compound 52 can undergo dehydration to form 53.63 According to 1H NMR data, when the reaction takes place in toluene, DCM and chloroform the product is 53. However, less than 5% conversion to 52 can be achieved by using THF or EtOH as solvent.

The effect of temperature on the reaction of benzaldehyde and nitromethane with compound 38a as catalyst was also tested. Heating the reaction at reflux in THF or ethanol for a period of 24 hours did not improve the results with this catalyst. 3-3-1- Henry reaction with compound 38c In related work, the use of complex 38c as catalyst, in the conditions which outlined in reaction 3.3.1.1 and Table 3.2 did however, provide the corresponding -hydroxy-nitroalkane product 52.

58

The best reaction condition were determined to involve the use of 10 mol% of 38c as catalyst in THF as solvent for 24 h (12 h reflux and 12 h rt). These reactions, however, resulted in only 2520% yield of the product 52. Complex 38c exhibit the highest reactivity among the synthesized complexes and provide a racemic mixture of product 52. The effect of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on the Henry reaction was also tested using 4-methoxy benzaldehyde and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. Under the same condition as reaction 3.3.1.1, the electron- withdrawing group was found to provide the highest yield (49%). With optimized reaction condition in hand, in order to see the effect of various synthesized copper complexes on the enantioselectivity, the chiral catalyst 39a was tested in the same reaction conditions. Surprisingly, the chiral copper pincer complex 39a did not afford any products. The structure of the ligand 39 may need further optimization to achieve the possible enantioselectivity. For instant, by altering the nature of the starting chiral amino alcohol various chiral oxazoline ligand can be developed. Further studies, hence, should aimed at designing new chiral ligands that can provide enantioselectivity for such transformations.

Conclusions In conclusion, general synthetic methods for the synthesize of four- and five-coordinated [(NN'N'')CuX] complexes X= Cl, Br, OH2 and NO3, bearing N-(2-(4,4-dimethyl-4,5dihydrooxazol-2-yl) phenyl) picolinamide (38) and N-(2-((3aR, 8aS)-8, 8a-dihydro-3aH- indeno [1,2-d]oxazol-2-yl)phenyl) picolinamide (39) pincer ligands have been realised. Metalation of compound 38 with gold(III) salts under the same conditions, however, led to open-ring adducts. Such complexes can be readily prepared on large scales without the exclusion of air or moisture. All synthesized complexes were characterized by X-ray diffraction crystallography. These compounds can be used for C-C bond forming reaction, particularly Henry reaction.

All solvents were further purified by solvent purification system. Most of the reactions were performed under ambient temperature unless otherwise stated. Sensitive reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of dinitrogen gas using standard vacuum line Schlenk techniques. All starting materials and solvents were purchased commercially or synthesised according to the literature preparations.75,
