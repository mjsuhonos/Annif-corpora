Abstract
By Ardian Dudi J anura DESIGN OF A PROTOTYPE BIORESORBABLE TIBIAL IMPLANT IN A SHEEP MODEL

MASc, Mechanical Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada, 2008

The purpose of this study was the design of a prototype calcium polyphosphate tibial implant for implantation into a sheep. In the design, several design parameters were considered: CPP implant structural strength, the maximum allowed micromotion of the structure at the interface with bone and the possibility of the surgeon implementing the necessary geometric changes on the bone elements during implant surgical insertion. A finite element analysis facilitated the design and allowed for the effects of the various geometric parameters investigated. This analysis was based on a real solid model of the sheep tibial bone based on the CT scans of a five year old sheep, and several were the geometric parameters investigated. The approach of the finite element analysis was very conservative, in the meaning that the load applied was purposely increased' in order to account for any possibly unknown factors that may exist and not implemented in the analysis.

Introduction and Background

Introduction

Hyaline cartilage is the load bearing medium located at the end of the long bones of synovial joints such as knee, hip, fingers etc. Due to the very limited ability to repair itself, damage of the Hyaline cartilage (also known as articular cartilage) either by trauma

or disease can permanently affect the functionality of the joint. Damage of the articular cartilage can lead to instability, and deformities that, depending on the location of the joint, can greatly affect even the simplest tasks of the everyday life. The most common
symptoms of damaged articular cartilage (arthritis) include pain, inflammation of surrounding structures, stiffening and swelling of the joint. The three most common forms of arthritis are: Osteoarthritis (OA), Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Post traumatic arthritis (PTA). Osteoarthritis is the most common

form of knee arthritis and is mostly found in the elderly of age above 60. OA is a slow
progressive degenerative disease in which the articular cartilage gradually wears away

due to the physical stress. RA is an inflammatory type of arthritis that can destroy the
joint cartilage and can be found at any age. The third type, PTA, is similar to OA and may develop years after a fracture, ligament injury, or meniscus tear.

Nowadays, several techniques are available to restore or repair damaged articular cartilage [1, 2]. Most of the techniques available are focused in using autologus

chondrocyte implantations. The cartilage for this procedure is harvested from a nonweightbearing area of the knee, and the number of chondrocytes is expanded in a culture medium and then re- implanted into the defective periosteal flap [3-5]. The success rate

for this type of procedure is estimated to be 50-80% [6, 7, 8, and 9].

A number of

complications may be experienced by the patients, mainly: incomplete restoration of the hyaline articular cartilage, ack of long- term stability of the repaired tissue [7, 8, and 10],
and graft detachment.

Another

widely

advocated

technique

is

the

osteochondral

transplantation

(mosaicplasty) [11, 12, 13, 14, and 15]. In this procedure, osteochondral plugs are taken from the peripheries of both femoral condyles at the level of the patellofemoral joint and

inserted as a mosaic to fill the defect. There are several advantages associated with this
procedure such as the fact that the defect can be filled immediately with mature, hyaline

articular cartilage,

and that there

is the same treatment for both

chondral

and

osteochondral defects. There are two main concerns associated with this procedure. Morbidity is a concern, limiting the area of the articular cartilage to be repaired by this

method to 4 cm2 [15] and secondly the possibility of lateral integration, a rare occurrence
[16], can result in cyst formation as result of penetration of synovial fluid into the
subchondral layer. The success rates for this procedure are reported to be 92% and 87%

for femoral condyle and tibia plateau mosaicplasty [15]. Allogeneic osteochondral grafts are another technique in which the damaged cartilage is replaced by healthy articular cartilage usually extracted from cadavers. Success rates for this procedure range between 65 %and 85% for a follow up period of
more than 10 years [17-19]. However, there are several drawbacks related to this

method, such as the scarcity of the donor material, problems related to the storage and handling of the frozen tissue, as well as the risk of disease transmission. Despite the risks

and the problems, this technique has been shown to be very successful; many patients
with large osteochondral defects have greatly benefited from this type of treatment. Applied mainly to young athletes, microfracture is another technique which is used to induce cartilage growth by stimulating a spontaneous repair reaction. For this

technique, it is recommended that very small holes, 0.5-1 mm diameter, and at a depth of
2-2.5 mm, be generated throughout the articular cartilage lesions. A decline in the success of this technique is observed for five years after its application for articular cartilage
repair [20].

In severe cases, where the articular cartilage defects are large, the knee is

resurfaced with metal and plastic implants.

They are designed to maintain the

functionality of the joint only in forward and backward direction. Both femoral and tibia
components are produced from titanium or cobalt-chromium alloys and the sliding

between them is achieved by the presence of high-molecular-weight polyethylene. Total
joint implants have been used for a period of 20 years with satisfactory success rates.

These success rates are reduced to 20% for a follow-up period of 10 years raising
questions with the viability of the method [21, 22].

Recent efforts have been focused in developing new treatment based on the bioengineering of articular cartilage which would have the potential to address all the

problems and complications associated with the methods mentioned above. The basic
concept is the in vitro generation of an osteochondral type plug of cartilaginous tissue on

top of porous ceramic substrate. In the work of Dr. Kandel [11,23], a sheep model has

been used, and cartilaginous tissue is derived from sheep (6-9 month old) by sequential
enzymatic digestion, and placed on top of a calcium polyphosphate (CPP) material [11, 23]. The use of ceramic porous materials such as CPP is desirable due to the osteogenity

and biocompatibility that these materials exhibit. Osteogenity is dependent on the porosity of the ceramics, and encourages bone ingrowth into pores, finally enabling a secure fixation of the implant into the bone as well as a secure anchoring of the in-vitro
formed cartilaginous tissue. The ultimate aim is the total replacement of the CPP

scaffold by the ingrown bone tissue, in theory achievable if the scaffold satisfies two requirements: firstly, bone ingrowth is possible for pore openings varying from 100-

300um to enable a normal bone remodeling process [24], and secondly bone ingrowth is
compromised for micromotion between implant and bone interfaces greater that 50(xm. The major concern related to the use of ceramics in general as bone substitute

materials is their low tensile strength. Initial studies suggest that the initial tensile strength of the ceramic implant must be higher than tensile strength of the cancellous

bone, i.e., in the range of 3-20MPa [25]. A CPP material satisfying this requirement has
developed, as shown by the work of Pilliar's group [26, 27].

Stability of the implant and subsequently the success of this method are also
determined by the geometrical structure of the implant and the anchorage method. These

factors can be determined with the help of finite element (FE) analysis which is a computerized numerical technique that is used to obtain approximated solutions of a set

of partial differential equations that predict the response of physical system "subject to
external loads. This forms the basis for the present thesis.

tibia, patella, ligaments, and cartilage. The purpose of the knee is the transformation of the biological loads between the femur, tibia, fibula, and patella. This load transfer is
controlled by the large ligaments which provide not only the connection between the bony structures of the knee (Femur, Tibia, and Fibula) but also the bracing of the joint

against any abnormal type of motion. There are four major ligaments present in human
knee: the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the medial collateral ligament (MCL), the

posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). A schematic diagram of the human knee is shown in Fig. 1.1.

Other parts of the knee are the cartilage layers covering the ends of the distal end of the femur and proximal end of the tibia, and menisci. The cartilage serves as a shock absorption medium during movements, while the meniscus is a tough rubber like
cartilage that is attached to the knee's ligaments and has two main functions: protection

of the end bones (femur and tibia) from rubbing against each other and it also serves as a
shock absorber.

1.2.1

Bone structure and functions

Bone is highly vascular and mineralized connective tissue which is characterized
by its growing mechanism, hardness and its capability to remodel itself. Some of the key functions performed by the bone are: to provide structural support and protection for

organs, to maintain the mineral homeostasis, and it is the primary site for the synthesis of
blood cells.

Bone is a dense multi-phase composite, which is made-up of cells embedded in an organized matrix which contains both organic and inorganic elements, and water. The

structure and the proportions of its components are dependent on the species, age, site

and history, resulting in many different classifications of bone possessing various mechanical properties. It has the capability to continuously remodel, throughout the
organism lifetime, in response to the changing mechanical conditions, always

maintaining an optimal balance between geometrical form and function. Bones are

classified into two different tissue types: cortical and cancellous bone. Both of these types of bone have the same composition, which can be split into three components: water, organic and mineral where the percentage of each constituent is dependent on the species. For human cancellous bone, the ratio between the water, organic and mineral constituent is 20%, 30%, and 50% respectively [2]. The ratio between the organic and inorganic

constituents for humans is 33% and 67% respectively.

The organic portion of the bone contains 10% noncollagenous proteins where its
presence is not directly related to the mechanical properties but to its maintenance. The main constituents of this portion are proteoglyeans and osteoealcin proteins which are

linked with the remodeling process of the bone [2-5], phospholipids and osteopontin

proteins, which are linked to the degree and control of mineralization, and lastly the
morphogenetic protein, which is linked to the osteoinductive properties of the bone itself [3-5]. The remaining 90% of the organic material contains predominantly Type I collagen
in combination with small quantities of Type III, IV, and V.

The mineral matrix is a mixture of calcium phosphate (Ca3 (PO4)2), calcium hydroxide (Ca (OH)2) and phosphate ions in crystallized form of hydroxyapatite

(Ca]0(PO4)6(OH)2). The hydroxyapatite is found not in the pure form but incorporated with other compounds and ions such as citrate, carbonate, Na, Mg, and HPO4 [4, 5, and
29].

Cortical bone, also known as compact bone, contributes roughly 80% of the total body weight. It has 70% solid volume fraction and is extremely hard, formed with

stacked layers. It can be considered a composite material with a density varying between

1.7 - 2.3 g/cm3 and with a porosity varying from 5 - 30% [2, 3]. Cortical bone is a very
compact medium where the porosity is due to the central canals of the Haversian system

allowing passages for blood vessel, cancliculi the interconnecting pathways between lacunae, and resorption cavities cause by the remodeling process occurring in any bone
[30]. A schematic diagram of the microstructure of the cortical bone is shown in Fig.

Cancellous bone, also known as trabecular or spongy bone

has the same cellular

composition as the cortical bone with a difference only on the material density which

varies from 1.6-1.9 g/cm3. The porosity of the structure varies from 30 % to a maximum
value of 90% [2]. The microstructure of the cancellous bone is shown in the Fig. 1.2B.

1.2.2

Cartilage

There are three type of cartilage present in human body: 1) hyaline cartilage, 2) fibrocartilage and 3) elastic cartilage. Hyaline cartilage, also known as articular cartilage,

is found at diarthroidal joints covering the extremities of the long bones. Articular cartilage is a load bearing hydrated connective tissue with the primary composition of
proteoglycans and type II collage. It is a nonhomogenous medium where the thickness,

density, and alignment of collagen fibrils vary with depth from the cartilage surface,

enforcing depth dependent properties.
Depending on the collagen content and fibril orientation, the cartilage layer, as

shown in Fig. 1.3, is divided in four zones. At the zone near the surface, the superficial
zone, the collagen content is at 85% by dry weight and the fibril are oriented tangent to

the surface indicating the shear bearing purpose of this zone. The collagen content drops
to 68% at middle zone, approaching the value at the tide mark [31, 32]. The mechanical behavior of the cartilage layer is determined by the interaction of

the two phases present: the fluid and matrix phases. The fluid phase contains water and electrolytes, where the water content for the articular cartilage rages from 68-85%. The solid phase contains type II collagen, proteoglycans, glycoprotein and chondrycyte; the last of which is responsible for construction of the cartilage matrix. Collagen content ranges from 10-20% while proteoglycans content varies from 5-10% [31, 32].

Calcium Polyphosphate scaffolds as bone substitute material

1.3.1

Fabrication of CPP implants

Calcium polyphosphate for use in bone scaffold applications is produced by the process of thermal decomposition (calcination) of the calcium phosphate monobasic

mondydrate (Ca (H2PO4)2(H2O)) at a temperature 500°C for a period of 10 hours [33, 34].
The resulting powder from this process is heated at 1100°C, until the melting point is
reached, and then held for one hour at this temperature, in order to induce chain lengthening. The resulting frit, after quenching, is milled and scanned in order to achieve

a particle with a size ranging between 75-106 urn.

This raw material has been used in

previous studies to manufacture, using gravity sintering, simple cylindrical shaped plug implants. [6, 27, 33]. In the present work, a much more complicated implant will be

designed and tested, and the CPP implant was produced by the Solid freeform fabrication
(SFF) process, and more specifically with Stereolithography (SLA) [33].

1.3.2

Calcium polyphosphate mechanical characteristics.

The use of ceramics as a bone substitute material has been the subject of many recent studies, because of their desirable characteristics such as osteogenity and

biocompatibility. In particular, calcium polyphosphate (CPP) has been extensively studied and shown to be extremely biocompatible, having calcium orthophosphate, a naturally metabolizable substance, as its product of degradation within the human body

[27]. Other important features such as the initial mechanical strength, and the rate of
degradation of the CPP material have been investigated in [26, 27, 33], where the studies

were accomplished both under in vivo and in vitro conditions.

Grynpas et al. [27]

showed that there is a dependency of the above characteristics on the particle sizes used in the CPP implant under in vitro conditions. The parameters analyzed, as a function of

particle size, during the life span of the CPP implants were CPP degradation rate, bone ingrowth degree, and variation of the mechanical strength of the implant. According to [27], the degradation rate was found to be inversely proportional to the particle size used in the CPP implant. It was found that for the implant with the finer size (45-105jam) degradation was estimated for a 6 week and 1 year period to be 47 and 57%, respectively. For an implant with medium sized particles (106-150um), degradation
was estimated to be 29 and 33% respectively, while for the largest sized particles (150250um) degradation was 9.5 and 14% respectively. The principal reason for the particle

size dependency on the rates of degradation is related to the fact that for small particle
size the zones of bonding of CPP particles are of greater atomic disorder making them susceptible to degradation.

Another reason affecting not only the rate of degradation but the bone* ingrowth process as well is the type of bone that the CPP material is contact with. Being more vascular than the cortical bone, at contact areas between cancellous bone and CPP
material both processes occur at a faster rate. In vitro studies of the CPP material showed that the mechanical strength is

heavily dependent on the powder particle size [33].

Tensile strength testing was

performed on two particle sizes: the fine power with particle size ranging between 106150(4,m and the coarse with particle size of 150-250 urn. The initial tensile strengths for

10

fine and coarse powder CPP material were measured to be 24 and 5.9 MPa, respectively. The effect of aging under in vitro conditions was measured for a period of 30 days, with
the resulting tensile strength for the specimens for fine power reduced to 8.0 MPa and for coarse powder reduced to 1.9 MPa. In this study, it was discovered that in both cases, fine and coarse power, the strength is reduced very rapidly in the initial stage of the aging
process, followed by a more gradual decrease over time.

Thesis Objectives

The research was conducted as part of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research

(CIHR) Bioengineering of Skeletal Tissues Team, a Canada wide team of researchers, of which the author's supervisor is a member, working toward developing bioengineered tissue replacements for arthoplasty. The author was the only member of the team working
on the design of the implant.

The purpose of this study was thus to design a prototype calcium polyphosphate

(CPP) tibial plaeau implant for implantation into a sheep model. In the design, a number of important factors had to be considered. Firstly, the strength and stability of the implant had to be such that it would not fail under a worst case simulated in vivo loading.
Secondly, the maximum allowed micromotion of the implant at its interface with bone was limited to ensure bone ingrowth could occur. Finally, the ease of implantation had to

be considered, so that the implant could be easily inserted by the surgeon using readily

available surgical tools.

The study will establish a methodology for the design and

analysis of bone scaffold based arthoplasty joints in an animal model, and it represents

the first step towards the implementation of the technology in articular cartilage repair of
a full joint in humans.

Material Models and Contact Boundary Problem

In this chapter, the theoretical background needed to understand various aspects of the

implant design will be presented. First, the material model used in the design of the implant will be briefly presented. This will be followed by a brief introduction to the
Finite Element Method, and a discussion of the contact boundary approaches used in the
finite element analysis.

2.1

Material Models

This section presents the constitutive equations of the various materials

considered in this thesis. A detailed description can be found at the book by Lekhntskii
[34]. During the comparative stage of the design, isotropic type material properties were

assumed for the cortical bone, cancellous bone, Calcium Polyphosphate implant, and titanium screw. Anisotropic material properties were used at a later stage, applied only in
the final design, with the purpose of quantifying the effect the isotropic assumption

against the real anisotropic properties of the bone elements. At this stage, the cortical
bone was considered to be transversely anisotropic, while the cancellous bone was
homogenous and anisotropic. Calcium Polyphosphate (CPP) implant and titanium screw
were assumed to exhibit isotropic properties in all cases.

2.1.1

Generalized Hooke's Law for Anisotropic Materials

To obtain the relationship between the components of stress and strain in an

elastic body, it is assumed that the components of strain are linear functions of
components of stress. In the general case of a homogenous anisotropic body, the

generalized Hook's Law in Cartesian coordinates has the form:

The systems of equations (2.1) and (2.2) contain 36 coefficients, the coefficients of deformation ay, and Ay, the elastic coefficients (moduli of elasticity). Materials that

exhibit such stress-strain relations involving a number of independent elastic coefficients

are said to be anisotropic. For a given temperature, time and location in the body, the coefficients ay and Ay are constants that are characteristics of a given material.
Assuming that the body undergoes deformation under load isothermally, and denoting the elastic potential by V (representing the strain energy of deformation per unit volume), the following relations result:

Differentiating expressions in (2.3) with respect to £x, sy,..., yxy gives:

Hence, it follows that the matrices of the elastic coefficients in eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) are

Therefore, the number of the coefficients in expressions (2.1) and (2.2) for the generalized anisotropic material is reduced from 36 to 21 independent coefficients.
In the generalized case, the expression of the elastic potential per unit volume has
the form:

In expressions (2.9) through (2.14) E^, Eyy, Ezz are the Young's moduli in three

Gyz, Gxz, Gxy denote the shear moduli

for shear deformation in the y-z , x-z, and x-y pjanes , respectively; Coefficients fizx>yz,

Mxy,yz,---, Myz^cy, characterize the shear stresses in planes that are parallel to one of the
coordinate system's planes which induce tangential stresses parallel to the other coordinate system's plane. For example, nyz>xy characterizes the shear in the plane parallel
18

to the xy plane which induces the stress xyz.

Coefficients t]yz^, tj^^, ..., tfXM are called

the coefficients of the mutual influence of the first kind. They characterize the stretching, for example, in the z-direction which is induced by the tangential stresses on plane xy.

Lastly, coefficients t\x,yz, t]y>yz..., t]Z)Xy are called the coefficients of mutual influence of the
second kind, and characterize the shears in the planes parallel to the coordinate system's planes ( e.g., yz-plane), under the influence of the of normal stresses (e.g., y-direction). Poisson's ratios are denoted by vyx, vzy, vxz, vxy, vyz, vw. They characterize the

transverse tension (compression) for compression (tension) in a direction of the axis of the coordinate (e.g. vyx characterizes the decrease in x-direction as the, result of tension in
the y-direction).

With the introduction of the coefficients given by expressions (2.9) through (2.14)
using the symmetry of the elastic coefficient's matrix at (2.1), the generalized Hooke's law can be written in the following way:

(2.20)

Expressions (2.14) - (2.20) describe the generalized case of anisotropy where the material displays different material properties in all directions, thus the material does not
exhibit any kind of symmetry. The number of independent elastic constant, as mentioned

19

above, is 21. Strain-stress relations are described by expressions (2.1) and (2.2) through
elastic constants a;j and Av which can be evaluated through technical coefficients by
means of expressions (2.9) through (2.14).

If the material possesses symmetry of any kind, then it is reflected in its elastic

properties, causing a reduction in the number of independent elastic coefficients. The

degree of this reduction depends on the depth of the symmetry of the material. A brief
description of some types of symmetry is given in the following section.

2.1.2

Elastic symmetry

If an anisotropic body possesses an elastic symmetry, then the equations of the
generalized Hooke's law are simplified. The degree in which these equations are

simplified depends on the degree of the symmetry resulting in the number of independent

elastic constants to be reduced to 13, 9, or to a minimum of two (E, v) which corresponds
to the case of isotropic material or total symmetry.

The simplified form of the generalized Hooke's law, due to the symmetry of the
material properties, is derived by the introduction of a second x'.y'.z' coordinate system,

which is symmetric to the reference body coordinate system x, y, z, in accordance with
the form of its elastic symmetry. Therefore, in the generalized Hooke's law, the
expression for both coordinate systems will have identical elastic coefficients

(coefficients ay at 2.1). Thus the elastic potential per unit volume for both coordinate
systems will have the form:
For the reference system x, y, z:

1 V = -au

(2.21)

For the second system x'.y'.z':

V = -a

Because the same quantity is evaluated by the above expressions, the following results:

-auax+auaxay+... + -a66txy

(2.23)

The position of the second coordinate system (x\ y\ z') with respect to the reference system (x, y, z) is determined by direction cosines given in the following table:

where a;= cos ( x, x') , fa = cos ( y, z') and so forth.

By projecting the stress

components of the reference coordinate system into the new system, the components of
stresses in the new system are obtained (in the areas normal to the new system axis) as:

(2.24)

tyz = axa2a, + ayj32/33 + <rzy2y3 + xyz

+ rx

r^ (a2/
(2.25)

The expressions for oy and c/are obtained by using expression (2.24) by
substituting in the right hand side of this expression the proper coefficients of the indices

a, fi, and y into (2.24), while the expressions for r^and r'xz are obtained by proper
permutation of the same indices using the expression (2.22).

21

Substituting the expressions for

ax,ay,a'z , zyz, r'xz, r^ into the right hand side

of eq. (2.21) and equating the coefficients for similar terms, gives the result that,
depending on the depth of the symmetry, many of the elastic coefficients become zero

and others are related by defined variations. Therefore, bodies that exhibit symmetries
will have a smaller number of independent elastic constants. The relationship between

the moduli Ay can also be obtained if elastic potential is expressed in terms of strain
instead of stress.

2.1.3

One Plane of symmetry

In this type of symmetry, the elastic properties of the material are the same in two

symmetric directions with respect to one plane. By directing the z-axis normal to the
plane of elastic symmetry, the system of equations (3.1) takes the form:

a

In this type of symmetry, the number of independent material constants reducesJo 13, as

the coefficients a14, a24, ^6, a]5, a25, a35, a56 and the corresponding moduli coefficients
Ay at (2.2) become zero. The direction normal to the plane of symmetry is called the principal direction because during tension-compression applied in this direction, the segments normal to the plane of symmetry remain normal during deformation.
Application of a stress in z-direction would lead to:

22

£y=>

(2.27)

Hence in this type of symmetry, the body possesses only one principal direction.

2.1.4

Three planes of symmetry

In this type of symmetry, elastic planes passing in every point of the material are orthogonal with each other. By selecting a coordinate system with an axis perpendicular

to the elastic planes, the generalized Hooke's law given by the system of equations in
(2.1) becomes:

In addition to the elastic coefficients of the case of one plane of symmetry,

constants a/6, ci26, a36, and a^j become equal to zero. Therefore, the number of
independent coefficients reduces to nine. The remaining elastic constants are called the principal constants: Ej, E2, E3 (Young's moduli), Vn, v2i, v23, v32, vjir v3! (Poisson's ratio
coefficients), and Gj2, G13, G23 (shear moduli). The system of eq. (3.23) can be written as
a function of these coefficients as follows:

Three principal directions are mutually orthogonal with each other, and a material
exhibiting this type of symmetry is called orthogonally-anisotropic or simply orthotropic.

2.1.5

One plane of isotropy

If a body possesses an axis of symmetry of rotation, then all directions in the

planes normal to this axis are equivalent with respect to the elastic properties and the body is isotropic in these planes. Generalized Hooke's law for materials exhibiting this
type of symmetry, in the Cartesian coordinate system with the z-axis perpendicular to the
plane of isotropy xy has the form:

where E and v are the Young's modulus and Poisson's coefficient, respectively, on the plane of isotropy, and E' and v' are the Young's modulus and Poisson's coefficient in the direction perpendicular to the plane of isotropy. Lastly, G and G' are the shear moduli for the planes perpendicular and parallel, respectively, to the plane of isotropy. A material exhibiting this type of elastic behavior is called transversely isotropic. The number of
independent elastic coefficients in this type of symmetry is six.

2.1.6

Isotropic Materials

If a material exhibits identical properties in all directions so that any plane
represents a plane of elastic symmetry, then the material is called isotropic. The number

of independent elastic coefficient reduces to two: E and v (Young's modulus and
Poisson's coefficient). In addition to the previously considered case of three-plane
symmetry, the following relationships also hold:

2.1.7

Cylindrical anisotropy

Then an infinitesimally small element is bounded by three pairs of surfaces

which are identical to the corresponding coordinate system surface, and the material is
referred to as a curvilinear anisotropic material. In the case of a Cartesian coordinate

system, the infinitesimally small material is bounded by a three pair of surfaces which
coincide with the planes of the coordinate system.

Two forms of curvilinear anisotropy considered by St. Venant are: cylindrical and
spherical anisotropy. The cylindrical anisotropy is defined as follows: All directions

normal to a certain axis, the axis of anisotropy, have, equivalent material properties. The
infinitesimally small elements are bounded by two planes orthogonal to the axis of the anisotropy, by two planes passing through this axis and by two surfaces of coaxial

26

cylinders. A graphic representation of a cylindrical element in two-dimensions is given in

Finite element equilibrium equations

The following brief summary of the basic concepts of the finite element method is

based on the book by Bathe [35]. The displacement- based finite element formulation is
based on the principle of virtual displacement. This principle states that in the equilibrium state, for small virtual displacements imposed on the body, the total internal virtual work is equal to total external virtual work, as described by the following expression:

jeTeT rdV=\u

(2.35)

where U and s are the virtual displacements and the corresponding virtual strains (where
T denotes the transpose), respectively. The right hand side of eq. (2.35) represents the

virtual work done by the externally applied loady5 (per unit volume, where B denotes the
body forces), surface traction fSf over a small area (Sf is the surface subject to the
surface traction f), and concentrated loads R'c where the superscript i denotes the point of load application. These three loads are expressed in components corresponding to the Cartesian coordinate system as follows:

Virtual displacements

are independent from the actual displacements that a body

undergoes due to the applied load, and are not real displacements. Stresses x are assumed as known quantities and are unique stresses that balance the applied loads. Virtual strains e* are calculated by the differentiations :

The virtual displacement field is continuous over the volume, with values from

zero at the surfaces where boundary conditions of displacement are imposed. When the
principle of virtual displacements is satisfied, all three fundamental requirements of mechanics are fulfilled: Equilibrium, Compatibility (continuous displacement field

satisfying the boundary conditions), and the stress-strain law holds because stresses t are calculated based on constitutive relationships from strains e.
Bodies are approximated in Finite Element Analysis as an assemblage of discrete

finite elements connected with each other at nodal points. The displacements are assumed to be a function of the nodal displacement, and are measured in a local coordinate system

x, y, and z chosen conveniently within each discrete element. Therefore, for a specific mth discrete element, the displacement u(m) is given by:

(2.39)

where H*m* is the displacement interpolation matrix, and U is the vector of the three
global displacement components

Using eq. (3.32), the element strains can be expressed as:

(2.40)

where B(m) is the strain-displacement matrix. The use of eqs. (2.32) and (2.33) together
with the principle of virtual displacement will process all element matrices of an

assemblage of elements, into governing structure matrices. This process is referred to as
the direct stiffness method.

be isotropic or anisotropic (as described in section 2.1) and can vary from element to
element. By using eq. (2.32), the equilibrium equation corresponding to the nodal point displacements can be given as a sum of integrations over volume and areas as follows:

Expression (2.44) represents the static equilibrium of the element assemblage.
The applied force may vary in time, in which case the displacement also varies in time

and the expression (2.44) becomes the expression of equilibrium for every specific point in time. The summation of the element volume and surface integrals evaluated from expressions (2.45) through (2.48) represent the direct addition of the element stiffness

matrices K(m), the body force vectors R^l), and Rs and R] similarly. This process of
assemblage is called the direct stiffness method.

In the above evaluations, inertial forces are negligible because the loads are
assumed to be applied slowly. If these loads are applied rapidly, then the inertial loads need to be calculated resulting in evaluation of mass and damping matrix for the body,

the resulting equilibrium equations are of the form:

Contact Boundary Problem

Boundary value problems involving contact are of great importance in all fields of engineering. Most of the problems involving contact between bodies can be treated by the assumption of small strains; however, due to the nature of the contact problem, all applications are nonlinear. These nonlinearities are as a consequence of the geometric and material discontinuity at the interface instead of the usual continuity property holding
in solid mechanics, and involve variational inequalities and constrained minimizations.

Contact problems can be combined either with large elastic or inelastic deformations, and
can include time-dependent responses. Hence, today's modern contact formulations in

computational mechanics have to account for all these effects and involve the use of
special algorithms to obtain the solutions.

In the following sections, the contact boundary problem that is briefly introduced
can be found described in detail in the book by Wriggers [36].

2.3.1

Contact Problem Definition

In continuum mechanics, contact problems can be included in the general
category of constrained minimization problems. If two bodies are in contact at time t,
with contact surface Yc, then the principle of virtual work can be written as:

rr = \w (c)dv - \f  <prdv - j> · <p'dA
Br B? ' Yl

^2.50)

Equation (2.50) represents the total potential energy of the system of interacting

bodies, where the contributions of the contact forces are included in the last term of the right-hand side. These contributions are represented by the general term f which

denotes the surface traction applied on the boundary ofBr. The contributions of body

forces fr acting on the body

Br

are included in the second integral, and Wr(c)

describes the strain energy function of the bodyi?r.

34

Figure 2.2 schematically illustrates the case of deformable-to-rigid contact in two dimensions, where contact areas between the bodies are denoted by Fc, the outward
normal vector to the surface is denoted by «, the gap between contacting surfaces is

denoted by g, and the contact pressure is denoted by p^.

Figure 2.2

Contact of two elastic bodies

The constrained minimization contact problem has the form:

b(y)=0

(2.51)

where y indicates the unknowns, and the functional II(y) describes the elastic potential,

the constraint set b(y) =0 denotes standard boundary conditions and the set g{y) < 0

collects the unilateral contact constraints. The constraint g(y) < 0 can result in a set of
simple geometrical non-penetration conditions, or can be associated with a contact
constitutive law that defines surface distance with respect to the contact pressure. For the

formulation given by equation (2.50), a solution y* must be found which fulfils all the
constraint set equations.

35

2.3.2

Contact Kinematics

Consider two bodies (31 and p2, approaching each other during a finite deformation
process and coming into contact on areas Fc as shown in figure (2.3).

Figure 2.3 Minimum distance determination, for deformed configuration of bodies B" [37]

Two points X1 and X2 in the initial configuration can occupy the same position in

the current configuration

<p[x2)= <p(x^) within the deformation process. The non-

penetration condition is given by :

2-^1)-^1 =0

(2.52)

where xa denotes the coordinates of the current configuration (p(Pa) of body pa : xa=Xa+ua
where Xa is related to the initial configuration of body pa and ua is the displacement

field. Every point x2 on T2 can be related to a point x1 = x1 UN on T via the minimum
distance problem

= Y -*'1! =

(2.53)

36

The distance, in eq. (2.53) can be used to define the gap or penetration between the two

bodies. £=(£1,^2) denotes the parameterization of the boundary F1 via convective
coordinates. The outward unit normal vector can be calculated by:

fl'x a 2
n =

a\x. a\

(2.54)

where a\ is the tangent vector at master point x{^\^2). Here the quantities with an over
bar represent their evaluation at the minimal distance point \^\^2j. Thus the above
expression can be written in the following form:

n

=

x2 -

(2.55)

Generally, this definition can be used in relation with the penalty method (see section
-i

2.3), and it has the problem that n
-i

is not defined for x2-.

=0. Once the point

x is known, either the inequality constraint of the non-penetration condition can be
defined as in:

gN=\x2-x\-n>0
or the penetrations function as in:

(2.56)

x -x \-n <0
&N
(2.57)

-A

-1

0

otherwise

37

The later defines the magnitude of penetration of one body into the other and has to be used in conjunction with the penalty method. In the case of geometrically linear
kinematics, the inequality constraint can be written as:

u2-u ln+gx>0
Where ua are the displacement of bodies |3a, and the gx = \X2 - X

(2.58)

· n represent the

initial gap between the bodies. Thus the penetration function, in view of the penalty
formulation, is given by the following:

u2-u\-n+gx...if...\x \ -x\-n+gx<0
0 otherwise

(2.59)

Functions gN and uN , in eqs. (2.57) and (2.59), indicate the penetration of one body into

the other. In the case of contact between a rigid surface and a deformable body, and this
1 --

will also hold, with the conditions thatw = 0, and n is normal to the surface of the rigid
body.

2.3.3

Tangential Contact
* ·

There are two distinguishing cases in the tangential direction. The first is the case

of a stick state where a point in contact is not allowed to move in the tangential direction.

The second case is sliding, where a point in contact is allowed to move in tangential
direction.

For the stick state case, the computed values of the convective coordinates

(^\^2) do not change during the motion, and hence £ = 0 . Thus, the stick condition
can be formulated as follows:

38

gr = gra a =

where

(2.60)

In the above expression, gj represent the relative displacements in the tangential direction, which for sticking must be zero. Thus, using the fact that the normal gap gN is equal to zero, and that gj= 0, a more simplified form results:

X

-- U

(z.61)

In the case of sliding, the tangential slip between bodies is related to the change of point

x2 relative to the projection x1 , which means that the solution point ^ = k',^2

obtained

through eq. (2.53) will move on the master surface (named as contactor surface). During calculations, the path during this movement can be arbitrary and cannot be assumed a priori. The relative tangential velocity along this path is given by:

gT =£"<*,,

(2-62>

Tangential stresses can be calculated from constitutive functions where tangential slip gr

enters as a local kinematical function. In the above expression, E," represents the relative
velocity in convective parameterized coordinates.

2.3.4 Constraint Formulation

The classical way to formulate a contact constraint is based in the idea of treating
normal contact as a geometrical constraint. The mathematical condition for non-

penetration is stated by the expression gN > 0, which excludes penetration as a possible situation into the solution. Contact takes place when gN = 0, and the associated normal

component p]N must not be zero and,

39

t] =

a\

(2.63)

Stress action on both contact surfaces obeys the principle of action-reaction, thus

the stress component action on one surface is equal and in opposite direction to the
corresponding stress component action on the other contact surface. For the frictionless
_i

case, the tangential stress component t T

becomes zero.

For contact between the surfaces, a combination of functions gN = 0 and pN < 0 hold, and when a gap is present between the surfaces, then the function combination gN > 0 and pN = 0 hold. Summarizing will lead to the statement known as the KuhnTucker-Karush condition for frictionless contact as:

gN>0,

pN<0, and gNpN = 0

(2-64)

At the contact interface, as mentioned previously, the response in the tangential
direction can be divided into two different actions. The first corresponds to the stick case
where the tangential velocity is zero:
(2.65)

gT=0

gr

=0

Associated with the above constraint is a Lagrange multiplier XT which denotes
the reaction due to the constraint.

The second situation occurs when the tangential forces overcome a certain limit,

and sliding between the contacting surfaces occurs. By assuming that Coulomb's friction
law holds on the contact surface with fi friction coefficient, the tangential traction
component can be evaluated by:

tT=-M

pN

Fig. 2.4 illustrates the normal and tangential interface conditions.

Figure 2.4 Interface conditions in contact analysis. (Left) normal conditions.
(Right) tangential conditions

Subsequently, the solution of the contact problem shown in Fig. 2.4 entails the solution of the virtual work (weak form) eq. (2.50) subject to conditions given by eqs.
(2.64) and (2.68). In the preceding equations, the static (or pseudo-static) contact

conditions are considered. In the dynamic case, the distributed body forces include the inertial force effects and the kinematics interface conditions must be satisfied at all times requiring displacement, velocity and acceleration compatibility between contacting
bodies.

41

2.3.5

Treatment of Contact Constraints and Contact Algorithms

Most standard finite element codes that handle contact problems use either the penalty or the Lagrange multiplier method. For a simplified contact representation, the contact interface can be considered as known. Thus, the variational inequality that the
solution of the contact problem has to fulfill is written as:

- \f-rirdV- jtr-rjrdA\ + Cc = O

(2.69)

where Cc are contact contributions associated with the active contact set, if are virtual
displacements which are zero at the boundary Trv , f , as mentioned before, denotes the body forces, and f denotes the surface on the boundary T\
The above equation (2.69) is obtained by the minimization of the total potential
energy for the system comprising two bodies in contact:

]M \WY (C)dV - \f  fdV - \f  fdA + nc =} MIN
7=1 yBr Br

(2.70)

Tl

where W7 is the strain energy related to body B\ and <p7 denotes the deformation of
bodies. The term nc includes the contribution of contact constraints in the potential
energy expression.

Several different variants for the formulation of nc and Cc are available. Such algorithms are: Lagrange multiplier method, the penalty method, the method of direct elimination of the geometrical contact constraints, the NITSCttE method , the perturbed
Lagrange, the Augmented Lagrangian, and the barrier method, etc. In finite element codes, contact algorithms can be divided into two main groups.

The first group, called the global algorithms, includes the contact search and the solution

of the variational inequalities algorithm types. The second group, called local algorithms,

42

includes contact detection, and algorithms dealing with the update of constitutive
equations and stresses.

In the following subsections the three most common algorithms will be briefly described: the Lagrange multiplier, the Penalty, and the Augmented Lagrangian method. These three algorithms are briefly treated in the contest of contact constraints treatment
and lastly in global solution algorithms.

2.3.6

LAGRANGE Multiplier Method

In the potential energy expression, eq. (2.50), the contact contribution according

to the Lagrange multiplier method takes the following form:

nLcM=

(2-71)

Therefore, this technique is based on the addition of the multipliers An and At , where gN

leads to the

+SATgT)dA

(2.72)

In the above formula, the first integral represents the virtual work of the Lagrange

multipliers along the variation of the gap functions in the normal and tangential directions, while the second integral describes the enforcement of the constraints. The

Lagrange multiplier XN can be identified as a constant pressure pn- 5gN and 8gx are the variations of the normal and tangential gap respectively. Lastly, terms Xx5gx and 8A,xgx
represent the tangential stick. In the case of the stick condition, the relative tangential slip gx is zero, for which the term Xj is treated as a reaction. In the case of sliding, a

tangential stress vector tx is determined from the constitutive law from frictional slip

43

where instead of writing M>gT, one would use tT5gT. Therefore the following expression
is true:
+

tTSgT)dA+ \8XNgNdA

(2.73)

Implementation of the Lagrange multiplier method as global solution algorithm occurs as follows. Using matrix notation, the total potential energy equation can be
written:

c(u)

{2.

Subject to the constraint Kuhn-Tucker-Karash condition formulated as:

Gc («) > 0

A(«) < 0

Gc («)A = 0

(2.75)

variation of expression 2.72 yields:

6ULM =3U + dATGc(u)+duTCc(u)TA = 0

(2.76)

From the expression above, the nonlinear equation system for arbitrary variation takes the
form:

G(u)+

Cc(u)rA =

0

Gc(u)=

0

(2.77)

For arbitrary du and SA, after the linearization of the above system of equations,
the following results:

Cc\u

Cc\u
0

Au

G\u \ + Cc\u
GCL\u

A
(2.78)

AAI

44

Thus the Lagrange multiplier method fulfills the contact constraints exactly by
introducing additional variables which here are denoted by A.

2.3.7

Penalty method

In this formulation, a penalty term due to the constraint conditions (2.59) is added
to the flas in the following expression:

Sn

+stSt'St dA...sN,sT >0

(2.79)

where £N and eT represent the penalty parameters. Variation of the above expression
yields:

Cc =

J

W...sN,sT>0

(2.80)

From the above expression, when sN -> oo and eT -> oo , the Lagrange multiplier method is obtained. However, large values of these parameters would lead to an illconditioned numerical problem.

For the case of slip conditions, where one of the frictional laws has to be applied ,
in the case of the Coulomb's friction law:

CcP =

gN

dA....sN,sT > 0

(2.81)

In the case where only stick occurs in the contact interface, then there is no need to distinguish between normal and tangential directions. In such a case, an equal number is

45

selected for penalty parameters for all direction: £=£N= eT and using the constraint given
by, the penalty term yields the expression for the contact contribution as:

Cfk= Ux2-xirj2-rj)dA

(2.82)

Because a high value of penalty parameter leads to an ill-conditioned problem, the
choice of this parameter is restricted for a given problem.

Implementation of the Penalty method as a global solution algorithm is
accomplished in the following manner. Using matrix notation, the total potential energy
expression can be written:

(2.83)

whose variation yields:

dUp =

(2.84)

Where the nonlinear equation system, unlike the Lagrange multiplier method, has the
form:

G{u) + £-Cc(u)TGc(u)=0

(2.85)

And as in the Lagrange multiplier method, linearization is required for equation^] at the
known displacement state, which results in:

Aw = --

G\u \ + Cc\u\ Gc\u

(2.86)

46

2.3.8

Augmented Lagrangian

Another method to regularize the non-differentiable normal contact and friction terms is provided by augmented Lagrange formulation. For normal contact the

augmented Lagrange functional is given by:

the case where there is no contact between the bodies^ >0) the functional takes the
form:

n?" = J-^r

(2.90)

The major problem associated with numerical treatment of the penalty method and

the contact interface laws is the ill-conditioning which arises where the large values of
the penalty parameters eN and 8T are selected, or the stiffness due to constitutive interface
laws are combined with the stiffness of the bodies within the finite element formulation.

A method to avoid the ill-conditioning associated with penalty method is the augmented
Lagrange technique which functions as a two loop algorithm known as the Uszawa

algorithm. The multiplier AN is kept constant during iteration of the inner loop, then
within the outer loop this multiplier is updated to a new value. For the frictionless contact

case, the contact contribution in the weak form can be expressed in the following Jbrm:

ruz --

U7V

~

\SgNdT

(2.91)

Since AN is unknown, an update procedure for the multiplier is constructed within the
iteration loop of the form: w (2.92)

As mentioned in the case of the treatment of contact constraints, the Augmented

Lagrangian method is based in the combination of penalty and Lagrange multiplier method when used as global solution algorithm. A matrix formulation for frictionless
contact is given with the following expression:

2s

(2.93)

In the above expression, A includes all contribution of the contact nodes fulfilling
the condition Asm+] - Asm + sNgNs, while X includes the nodes with lsm+x > 0 ensuring the

differentiability of the function. Variation of the above equation with respect to
displacement and Lagrange multipliers yields the nonlinear system of equations:

Lagrange functional with A constant Lagrange multiplier:

The variation with respect to displacement is given by the following expression:

CHAPTER 3
CAD MODELING

51

In this chapter, the CAD modeling of the bone, which includes both the sheep cortical and cancellous portions, the fixation screw, the Calcium Polyphosphate (CPP) implant, and the cartilage layers, will be presented. The transformation of the bone from computed tomography (CT) scans to computer aided design (CAD) surfaces modeling with MIMICS (Materialise HQ, Leuven, Belgium) will be described in Section 3.1. The modeling of the implant, screw and assembly of the components with SolidWorks (SolidWorks Corporation, Concord, MA, USA) will be described in Section 3.2 and the final smoothing of the model with Rhinoceros 3.0 (Me Neel North America, Seattle WA, USA) is described in Section 3.3. The chapter will briefly describe the issues encountered during the modeling with each of the software packages and the methods used to address
these problems.

3.1

CAD modeling of the Bone.

It was ultimately desired to construct a 3D model of the tibial plateau of a sheep, so that a CPP implant which would replace the medial side of the plateau could be designed and constructed. Modeling with Materialised Interactive Medical Image

Control System (MIMICS), represented the initial step in the construction of the bone CAD model. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is a process in which the relative

density of scanned tissue is determined by the use of X-rays. Depending on the type of medium at a specific location of the bone, the resulting image at the CT scan for that
location may appear white or black. If the medium is dense (such as cortical bone) the outgoing beam intensity is weaker resulting in a bright area. If the medium is less dense,

the loss of beam energy is smaller, and thus the outgoing beam is stronger, resulting in a darker area at the corresponding location in the CT scan. The end result of this process is a stack of two-dimensional images of the tissue, representing its cross-section at various locations along its length. The information provided by the stack of two-dimensional CT scans can then be used to reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of bone.

52

A CT scan of a three year old sheep tibia was obtained as contiguous images such that the voxel size was 128 jam with a slice distance of 175 um, providing a total model
height of 38.15 mm. In the present sheep tibia case, it was necessary to convert the CT scan slices into 3D surface representations of both the cancellous and cortical portions of the bone, since they have different material properties. This was done using the following
general steps:

1)

Segmentation of cross - sectional slices along the length of the bone
(proximal to distal portion of the tibia) s

2)

Re-slicing
scans

along medial/lateral plane, and segmentation of re-sliced CT

3)

Polyline creation and surface construct from polylines

Segmentation of cross sectional slices along the length of the bone

The first step in acquisition of the three-dimensional model of the cortical part of the bone was the creation of the mask, a collection of pixels on which all editing and calculations are performed. The mask was created by the process of 'segmentation' in

which a desired group of pixels of ith intensity falling within a set of lower and higher
threshold values is assigned to the mask. For the cortical bone, the lower and upper pixel intensity values were determined to be 1340 and 2590 respectively. With this action, the highlighted region of interest (cortical part of tibia), was established simultaneously for all slices. Based upon the information in 136 slices, the three-dimensional model of the lower portion of the tibia was constructed. The overall height if this portion was 23.8
mm. Due to MIMICS software characteristics, where it is not possible to calculate

polylines on the axial view with multiple peaks, re-slicing of the initial CT scans was

necessary. The difference between the initial setup and re-sliced setup is given in Table

53

3.1. Three sectional views in the initial and re-sliced model were used, where the views
are determined as perpendicular to the planes created by the actual directions of tibia.

Manual erasing of some portions of the individual slices was required to obtain

the cortical bone alone, because some of the images did not threshold properly. Erasing of the undesired pixels was performed separately on individual slices. Thus, after the erasing process, the masks were constructed on the slices corresponding to the lower portion of the tibia shown as in Figures 3.4 -Figure 3.6.

3.1.2

Re-slicing along medial/lateral plane, and segmentation of re-sliced CT scans

In the re-sliced model, the segmentation procedure threshold process was similar
to that of the lower portion of the tibia, with the difference only on the sectional view positions. Re-slicing of the images in the perpendicular plane was accomplished by

drawing a line with direction from the lateral to the medial side of the tibia Due to this
process, there was a shift of the views in MIMICS; a shift of the sagittal view to the axial

view occurred from the initial setup to the re-sliced setup. The axial view in the re-sliced
model is given in Figure 3.7, followed by the Coronal and Sagittal views in Figure 3.8
and Figure 3.9, respectively.

In order to have a better capture of the tibial plateau (i.e., the top of the tibia),
which was the region of interest for implant design, in the axial view; closure by a

semicircle was applied to each individual slice enabling the generation of inner and outer polylines separately. . This shape closure was selected based on preference of having the polyline calculation based on the inner and outer edges of the plateau separately instead
of having only one for both simultaneously. The latter would have had a large effect on the quality of the surface construction over these polylines because it would have

introduced a large mismatch with the surfaces obtained in the initial model (lower portion
of the tibia). This closure is shown in Figure 3.7, in the upper portion of the picture.

Figure 3.9 Sagittal view of the tibia plateau in the re-sliced model

The quality of the surfaces in the re-sliced model was highly dependent on the

closure method employed. Avoiding sharp corners, and with a semicircular shape of an average width of three pixels (0.54 mm), caused the majority of the control points of the

surface to fit onto the polylines. These surfaces represent the upper and inner surfaces of
the tibial plateau.

58

3.1.3

Polyline creation and construction of surfaces

For both models, i.e., the lower portion of the tibia and the tibial plateau, the

polyline construction was based on two MIMICS functions: 'Polyline calculation' and
'Polyline growing'. Polyline calculation is a function that calculates the best fit of, and
constructs, polylines along the boundaries of the mask. These polylines are built based on

the axial view of the layout. A major obstacle at this stage was the fact that some of the fit polylines intersected each other. By trial and error, the encountered polyline intersections were avoided by modifying the zones in which they occurred. This
modification consisted of widening the strips of pixels representing the cortical width at a particular location, for approximately two to three slices before and after the slice where the intersections occurred. This problem was mostly encountered on the re-sliced model. 'Polyline growing' is a function that enables the creation of a set of polylines
connecting the different cross-sectional slices, based on the previously calculated cross-

sectional polylines. For each of the MIMICS models, two independent sets were created using these functions: one set for the inner and the other of the outer group of polylines.
Based on these sets of polylines, outer and inner freeform surfaces were constructed,

whose shape and characteristics depended on two fitting parameters, u and v.

The u-

parameter ran perpendicular to the image plane, while the v-parameter ran within the

cross-sectional image plane. For each of these parameters, the order, number of control

points, and the choice of either open or closed shape had to be selected. The order of
polynomials used could be chosen from one to five. The number of control points

available depended on the parameter: e.g., for the u-parameter with a 4th order, the

maximum number of the control points was 132, and for the 4th order v-parameter, the
maximum number of control points was 26.

In the present work, an 'Open' surface was selected for the w-parameter and a 'Closed' surface for the v-parameter. The best fit of the freeform surface upon the selected set of polylines was based on a combination of the number of control points and

order of polynomials used for both parameters. As the number of control points increased, it increased the accuracy to which the surfaces fit to the polylines; however,
this increase was limited by the fact that a choice of too many control points caused the

59

fitted polynomials to have the tendency to form a wave which no longer actually fit the surface. Therefore, many trials were conducted by varying the u and v parameters until
the best overall fit of the surface to the polylines was achieved. This resulting
combination of both models is shown in Table 3.2.

As seen in Table 3.2, the number of control points for the outer and inner surfaces within each model was different. These differences are the results of the effort to avoid surface intersection, especially on the lower part of the tibia. At the tibial plateau model
intersections were allowed only on the semicircular closure, where no effect on the shape
tibia plateau resulted.

The end result of the segmentation and polyline fitting was a set of surfaces representing the outer and inner (where the cortical met the cancellous) boundaries of the
cortical bone IGS (Initial Graphics Exchange Specifications) format.

3.1.4

Conversion of cortical bone surface to solid model using SolidWorks

The creation of the 3D solid representation of the cortical bone from the surfaces obtained during modeling with MIMICS was accomplished using SolidWorks software. Surfaces obtained from MIMICS were imported into SolidWorks in IGS format, and the

first objective was the construction of the solid cortical bone from these surfaces. The
procedure was different for the lower portion of tibia model than the tibia plateau. For the
lower portion, the solid was obtained by constructing bounding surfaces with borders at

the,edges of the surfaces imported from MIMICS. The solid obtained in this manner very accurately described the actual cortical bone boundary for the lower portion of tibia. The

only simplification made during modeling was the attachment location of the patellar

60

tendon (located at the ventral side of the tibia). The cavity housing the ligament attachment was eliminated due to complications encountered during freeform surface
construction with MIMICS as shown in Figure 3.10.

Another issue identified with the solid was the waviness of the inner and outer surfaces of the solid, as shown in Figure 3.10 which would likely pose problems during finite element meshing. This problematic feature was eliminated using Rhinoceros 3.0
software as explained in Section 3.1.5. To obtain the solid form of the tibial plateau from the individual surfaces constructed in MIMICS, the solid models were first created from the inner and outer surfaces. The final solid model representing the cortical bone was obtained by subtracting the solid obtained from the inner surface from the solid model obtained from outer
surface.

The resulting solid, which includes the true shape of the tibia plateau in addition
to the shape obtained from the closure, was cut using the function 'Cut with a plane'

available in SolidWorks at the proper height. The sectional view of the tibia plateau is
shown in Fig. 3.11.

Smoothing of problematic areas in cortical bone with Rhinoceros

The solids representing the lower portion and the tibia plateau, were then joined together to create the representation of the total cortical bone (plateau and lower pertion).
The constructed cortical bone, despite the best efforts to minimize the mismatch between

plateau and lower portion, possessed two zones in which there was still some mismatch (highlighted in red in Figure 3.12). These zones were generated by split lines and existed
in both the inner surfaces (not shown) as well as the outer surface. The purpose of the

bottom strips was to avoid the wavy surfaces (inner and outer) present at the mid-height of the model (areas between height of 8 mm and 1 mm). The reason for creating the

upper strip was to provide a natural and smooth transition between the two solid cortical
elements.

eliminated by the use of this software. Rhinoceros 3.0 was used for several purposes which include: smooth transition between lower portion of cortical bone and tibia plateau, elimination of wavy surfaces, modeling of cartilage layers which included the repair of surfaces, and lastly for each implant it was used to generate the front face of the
keel (see Section 3.2).

The model of the cortical bone, as shown in Fig 3.12, was imported, in IGS

format, into Rhinoceros 3.0.

The

edges of the surfaces not needing to be

modified

(colored red) were divided into several segments through key points. At the convenient
points aligned on one axis, new polylines were constructed. To keep the curvature of

these polylines such that the surface that was being generated would be as close as
possible to that of the surfaces being replaced, midpoints were used on the surfaces
before they were deleted.

As an example, in Fig 3.13, the surfaces colored in red are the surfaces that will remain unchanged, the two new surfaces to be created are colored in cyan, and the faulty

surface being replaced has already been deleted. Polylines were constructed from points

63

(1) to point (3) and from point (2) to point (4) through all corresponding points which lie on the horizontal axis between these points. Using these polylines as profile lines and
using the edges of opposing surfaces (edges 3 and 4), new surfaces were constructed using the Rhinoceros functions 'sweep 2 rail' or 'surface from edges'. The same

procedure was followed in replacing all transition surfaces and surfaces containing wavy areas. A similar procedure was used to repair the inner surfaces of the cortical bone and for the construction of the cartilage surfaces based on surfaces imported from

SolidWorks.

The end result of the modified cortical bone model is shown in Fig. 3.14, where the problematic areas are eliminated. This solid model was ultimately used to derive

other portions of the model such as the cancellous bone and the top portion of the
implant.

Generation of cancellous bone

The end result of the modified cortical bone shown in Fig. 3.14 was also used to
obtain solids representing the cancellous bone and the (inner layer of spongy bone) was created by simply deleting all the outer surfaces, so that the resulting solid was based on

the inner surfaces of the cortical boundary. To close the cancellous solid at the distal end, a planar area having boundary edges at these inner surfaces was used. During this process, the coordinate system created for the cortical bone was preserved for the
cancellous bone, to make it easier to import into the finite element software. The resulting

cancellous bone solid representation is shown in Fig. 3.15.

3.2 Generation of solid model representing various prototype implants

The implant model was comprised of two parts: the body which was derived from the outer surfaces of the cortical bone shown in Fig. 3.13, and the keel which was constructed based on simple geometric shapes. The implant body, as shown in Fig. 3.16,

was constructed from the outer surfaces of the cortical bone, ensuring the exact match
with the replaced zone on the medial side.

Two Calcium Polyphosphate (CPP) implant body lengths (i.e., the maximum distance from vertical face to the furthest point on the medial side) were analyzed: 22.65 mm and 16.9 mm. These lengths were derived by creating cutting planes parallel to the 'top plane' (plane perpendicular to the medial-lateral direction), which was identical for
all parts, with distances 27.36 mm and 33.11 mm respectively (measured from top plane which is parallel to the ventral-proximal plane) Initially the height of the implant was selected to be 9.5 mm (maximum height) which was derived by cutting with the 'front plane' (plane perpendicular to the distal-proximal direction). Later, from the results of

the finite element analysis, this height was increased to 10.75 mm (Section 5.1). The
maximum height was the distance from the horizontal face to the highest point on the CPP implant upper surface.

To ensure that the implant could be easily slid into position after a surgical removal of the tibial plateau, and would remain stable while load bearing, a keel structure was implemented on the bottom (distal) surface of the implant (Fig. 3.17). Two basic shapes of the cross-section of the keel were analyzed: trapezoidal and semicircular. The final shape of the model was established by considering the method of implementation during surgical operation. Therefore, surgeon preference was strongly taken into

consideration. The different geometric parameters varied to determine the final shape of
the CPP implant are shown in Figs. 3.17 , 3.18, and 3.19.

During the FE analysis (Section 5.1), it was quickly discovered that the implant performance was heavily dependent on the position where the screw exited the keel. Therefore, preferring this exit to be at the back face, the length of the keel was adjusted
accordingly. Table 3.3 summarizes the various dimensions of the CPP implant models that were constructed and used in the FE analysis.

Implant models were derived as a combination of several variables: e.g., the height, length and keel angle were kept unchanged the implant behavior was analyzed as function of screw angle insertion. Depending on this angle, the length of the keel was adjusted to ensure that the screw exit coincided at the back surface. The for the screw

insertion angles between 10 and 20° the keel length varied from 13.5 to 21 mm.
Semicircular cross section keels having radius 6, 5, and 4 mm were investigated. For the trapezoidal cross-sectional shape keel, the width at the base varied between 8 and 12 mm,

with the angle of the trapezoid varying from 0 to 90°.

Screw Insertion Angle

After presenting the candidate keel designs to the members of the surgical team working on the project, it was decided that only the keel with a semicircular cross-

sectional shape with varying back end shape would be investigated in detail.

It was felt

that it was simpler to create the keel's imprint on the cancellous bone with a semicircular cross section, because only a simple vertical movement of the drill bit would provide the groove. However, two different types of back end design were investigated. The first was with a conical back end, exactly mirroring the shape left by the drill bit (Fig. 3.20) and the second model was with a slight modification of the conical back end where the tip of the cone was modified for reason explained in Section 5.2 (Fig. 3.21)

The height of the keel was maintained constant at 6 mm, and to achieve this
height for the semicircular keel cross-sectional shape, a prismatic solid was added. For

71

example, for a 3 mm radius of cross section, a prism was added at the base with a height
of 3 mm. In all cases, the volume of the bone being replaced by the implant was extracted from the cortical and cancellous bone by the use of the 'cavity function' in SolidWorks,

where the volume to be subtracted from the cortical and cancellous bone solids (shown in
Fig. 3.14 and 3.15) was the volume of the implant itself. For obtaining the front face of the implant's keel, the procedure was different. The body of the implant with the structure of the keel attached to the cortical bone was imported into Rhinoceros 3.0. The front face of the keel was obtained by trimming the

corresponding area from outer surface of cortical bone, and using the obtained surface to
trim the structure of the keel (shown in Fig. 3.22). In this way, there was exact match between keel front face shape and cortical bone in the bone assembly.

Prior to the export into Ansys Workbench, because the applied loading was to be

distributed as a pressure over the surface of the CPP implant (Section 4.2), multi surfaces were generated by splitting the upper surface into 80 pressure surfaces.

72

These pressure surfaces (Fig. 3.23) were identical for all types of implants tested,

allowing for identical loading conditions to be compared across all designs. The pressure surfaces were created in the following manner: From the 'right plane' (perpendicular to
the medial-lateral direction) of the coordinate system, a series of equally spaced (2.15
mm apart) parallel planes was generated with an initial distance from the right plane of

18.5 mm. From the vertical face, a series of parallel planes was constructed with distance

of 1.28 mm. Then over the 'front plane' (plane perpendicular to the axial direction) a series of lines was constructed over the planes generated. These lines were selected to be
the split lines, generating the pressure surfaces over the upper surfaces of the implant.

Attachment of the implant to the bone was achieved through the use of a titanium
screw, which was also was modeled using CAD techniques. Initially, a cancellous screw

73

was modeled (Fig. 3.24) complete with threads. Initially a cylinder was constructed with
diameter equal to that of the major diameter of the real cancellous screw (3.5 mm).

Figure 3.24 Cancellous screw. Pitch 2mm. Major diameter 3.5 mm. Minor diameter 2.6mm

and the chronological steps in creation of the threads were:

1)

Drawing of a circle with diameter equal to the diameter of the major diameter
of the screw.

2)

Construction of the helical profile, based on the circle constructed during the first step, along the length of the screw body using the function 'Helix/Spiral'
available in SolidWorks. The pitch used at this stage was the same as the pitch

of the cancellous screw.
3) Drawing of a rectangular profile, which was used to create the cavity

following the helical profile constructed during the second step

4)

Creation of the cavity, resulting in thread creation, using the function 'CutSweep' available in SolidWorks.

^

The presence of threads on the screw and their mirrored grove in the cortical and

cancellous bone would require a very large number of elements in the FE analysis. Due to

restrictions on the number of elements with the license of the FE software, the use of a

74

fully modeled cancellous

screw was

abandoned in

favor of a more simplified

cylindrically shaped screw (Fig. 3.25).

Simplified Cylindrical Body Titanium Screw

The implications of this simplification will be described in Chapter 4. For every assembly analyzed, prior to the export to the FE software, the volume occupied by the
screw was subtracted from the cortical, cancellous and implant solids, leaving the
properly sized screw holes.

3.3 CAD modeling of the cartilage layers

The last elements modeled in SolidWorks were the cartilage layers on the medial and lateral sides of the tibial plateau. This was achieved by offsetting the upper surfaces (plateau) of the cortical solid model given in Fig. 3.13, by a distance of 0.4 mm (the thickness of the modeled cartilage layer), and erasing every other surface present in the cortical model. The cartilage layer height at sheep varies from 0.4-0.5 mm. This formed a solid representation of the cartilage layer that would be placed on the top of the tibial plateau. The solid derived in this manner inherited many flaws, such as gaps and defective surfaces. Therefore all surfaces, offset and original were exported in IGS format into Rhinoceros 3.0 in order to reconstruct the defective surfaces and close the gaps.

From the Rhinoceros software, the modified cartilage model was imported back into SolidWorks in IGS format as a collection of surfaces, where the transformation into

75

a solid representing the model of the cartilage layer occurred. The cartilage solid model was cut into two parts: the lateral cartilage part which represented the native cartilage and
the medial part which represented the implanted cartilage layer. Cartilage layers obtained in this manner had identical coordinate systems with all other element of the bone
assembly and the contact surfaces matched exactly with cortical bone and implant. When cartilage layer modeling was included in the analysis, pressure surfaces

were also generated in the upper surface of the medial implanted cartilage instead of just
the upper surface of the CPP implant. The process of generating these pressure surfaces, shown in Fig. 3.27, was identical to the process used for the pressure surfaces on the CPP
implant solid model (Section 3.2).

3.4 Construction of bone assemblies with and without cartilage layer

Cartilage layers were introduced only in the final phases of the project, when the
modeling of cartilage layers was performed in native Ansys (Section 5.6). During implant shape determination modeling, no cartilage layers were modeled, and Ansys Workbench was used. Thus, in these cases, the assemblies analyzed included the cortical bone, cancellous bone, CPP implant, and Titanium screw solid models.
The assemblies were generated by mating the bone parts by their three reference

planes.

This was easily accomplished, because all parts were generated based on the

cortical bone coordinate system which was preserved during the solid generation of the cancellous bone, implant, screw, and cartilage layers. The assembly for the shape determination stage is shown in Fig. 3.26 and that used for the modeling of the assembly where the cartilage layer was included into the analysis is shown in Fig. 3.27.

Optimization of Implant Shape using Finite Element

Analysis: Input of Boundary Conditions and Material
Properties

79

Using the models built during the CAD modeling phase (Chapter 3),

a

comparative analysis was pursued in order to determine the best possible geometrical
shape of the CPP-Implant. For this purpose, all the models were imported into Ansys

Workbench v.10.0, and analyzed under identical loading and material properties. A
number of different contact conditions between the implant and bone were considered, each with a variety of changes in geometrical shape (and related changes) of the implant.

This section describes the material properties, boundary conditions and applied
distributed loads used, and the setup of the finite element analyses. The best performing
model was further investigated under contact conditions which included frictionless type

contact with the purpose of having a complete picture of implant behavior. This consisted
the scope of the final stage design.

4.1 Material Properties 4.1.1 Isotropic material model

The majority of the finite element (FE) analyses were performed using isotropic material properties for the bone elements, CPP implant, and screw, in order to reduce the computational time. The isotropic assumption is often used in biomechanical studies of bone/implant systems, when comparative, rather than absolute values are desired [38]. This allowed the various implant geometries to be compared relatively quickly, so that the most promising designs could be selected for more in-depth analysis. Compared to when anisotropic properties for cortical and cancellous bone were used (provided in Tables 4.1 and 4.2), the models solved approximately 10% faster using isotropic
properties.

The implementation of material properties into Ansys is straightforward. For the

isotropic case, for each material only two inputs are required, Young's Modulus and Poisson's ratio. These values are presented in Table 4.1 for each bone type, CPP implant
and Titanium alloy. Isotropic properties were also used to analyze the final, optimized

model, representing the best possible choice. In this case, the only variable that changed in the analysis was the different type of contact condition at the various interfaces
(Section 4.2).

Anisotropic Material Properties

The assignment of anisotropic bone properties for cortical and cancellous bone was accomplished using a slightly different procedure. Because cortical bone exhibits

transversely-isotropic properties [39, 40], a cylindrical coordinate system was defined
with the origin at the same position as the global coordinate system. The theoretical

background for this type of material properties was given in section 2.1.5, and cylindrical symmetry is described in Section 2.1.7, where the plane of isotropy is the plane on which
the radial and tangential directions lie.

For the cylindrical coordinate system used in defining the cortical bone properties (shown in Fig. 4.1), the radial and tangential directions were defined as Ex and EY, respectively. As described in Section 2.1.5, the number of input parameters is six.

The cancellous bone was considered to be homogenous anisotropic with three planes of symmetry [39, 40]. The theoretical background for this type of symmetry was described in Section 2.1.4. and the number of required input parameters is nine.

Using the inverse of the matrix provided in eq. (2.34) with the coefficients

provided in expression 4.1, the elastic properties of the cortical bone given in Table 4.2
result.

The Young's moduli and Poison's ratios for the anisotropic properties of the sheep cancellous bone were taken from [42]. Because anisotropic shear data is not

available for sheep cancellous bone, it was considered to be similar to that of human tibial cancellous bone, as it has been found that humans and sheep have similar organic and inorganic cancellous content, resulting is similar anisotropic elastic properties [43].

4.1.3

Design criteria implemented in the analyses

The criteria used to determine the best possible design were maximum stress

observed in the model and relative micromotion at the interface between the implant and bone. Limiting values the maximum stresses observed in the CPP implant were thus set at 28 MPa, the ultimate tensile and 56 MPa, and the ultimate compressive stress values. The maximum relative micromotion between CPP implant with cortical/cancellous bone

interfaces was limited to 50 um, a value at which the bone ingrowth process is
compromised.

The easiest way to determine the maximum stress and location in the model is
through the implementation of the 'failure criteria' option in ANSYS Workbench. Use

of this feature resulted in contour plots of safety factor (i.e., ratio of failure stress to

calculated stress), which were used to identify the critical areas where fracture or failure was most likely to occur. Selection of the best possible model was based on these safety
factors for each CPP implant model.

Depending on the material, three failure criteria were used in the analyses: the maximum tensile stress theory, the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory, and the maximum
shear stress theory (i.e., Tresca criterion).

A short description of these failure theories is given in the following:

84

a)

Maximum Tensile Stress Theory [44, 45]

Failure will occur when the maximum principal stresses equals or exceeds the
tensile stress limit. This theory can be used for both brittle and ductile materials, depending on the type of the tensile stress considered (Ultimate or Yield stress). For brittle materials:

(4.2)
'UT

where <jUt (ultimate stress in tension) is the ultimate' tensile or compressive
stress for the brittle material. For ductile materials, the theory states that:
<1
'YT

(4.3)

where <7YT is the yield tensile stress for the ductile materials.

b)

The Mohr-Coulomb failure [44, 45] theory states that failure occurs when the combination of maximum and minimum principal stresses at one location equals or exceed their respective stress limits. The design goal, for this theory, is thus to limit the maximum and minimum principal stresses to their ultimate strength values, expressed mathematically as:

(4.4)
'UT
'uc

where aVT and avc

are the ultimate tensile and compressive stresses for

brittle materials respectively. The Mohr-Coulomb failure theory can also be applied to ductile materials, by replacing the ultimate stress by the yield stress

c)

The Maximum Shear stress failure theory [44, 45] for ductile materials states

that failure occurs when the maximum shear stress equals or exceeds a specific shear limit. This theory can be expressed by:

85

T > f "max ~ J

hmit

(4.5)

Where / is a fraction that can be manually selected, usually taken as 0.5 (Tresca criterion). The limiting value for the stress S]imit can be either the yield or ultimate stress. Maximum shear stress Tmax represent the maximum

value of shear stresses given by the formulas:

Where Gi, 02, and a3, are the principal stresses at a point.

For the Calcium Polyphosphate implant, the two failure theories used were: (i) the
maximum calculated tensile stress was compared to the ultimate tensile stress of the CPP

implant (Table 4.1), and (ii) Mohr-Coulomb failure theory was applied using the ultimate tensile and compressive stresses. For the Titanium alloy screw, the two failure theories that were used were: (i) the maximum tensile stress was compared with the yield stress of
the Titanium alloy (Table 4.1), and (ii) the maximum shear stress theory (Tresca)

criterion was applied using the yield stress.

4.2

Distributed Applied Load and Boundary Conditions

The loads applied onto the tibial plateau, were provided in the form of a distributed

pressure, locally normal to the surface, from in-vivo Fuji pressure film measurements on a sheep. This pressure film had a minimum sensitivity value of 2 MPa, which meant that values of pressure smaller than this value were recorded as zero. The reference coordinate

86

system has its origin at the lowest point between two tips on the tibia plateau (Fig 4.2).

These loads correspond to a three year old sheep weighting 60 Kg.

The average of the pressure data, when considering all the zeroes as true pressure

values, was 1.3 MPa. When considering these zero values to be just below the sensitivity

threshold (~ 2MPa), the average of the data was 3.2 MPa.
In the Fuji film measurements, only the normal pressure was measured. To

account for the unmeasured tangential stress over the tibial plateau, the raw data was used

in the following manner, resulting in an average stress of 5.3 MPa. Because the loads

were provided as pressures at various coordinates on the tibial plateau, and Ansys only
allows pressure to be applied over finite areas, it was necessary to divide the tibial plateau

surface into a number of finite load application surfaces, as described in Section 3.2.

Each pressure application surface had an x-direction length (on the xy-plane) of 2.18 mm

88

and a width of (y-axis) of 1.28 mm, as shown in Fig. 3.23. The applied pressure on each

of these surfaces was held constant at the value described using the following procedure:
In cases where, within the pressure surface the corresponding pressure data were all zeroes, the pressure applied in the analysis was 2 MPa. When the data for a pressure

surface was greater than 5 MPa, all zero pressure values were disregarded in the load value determination. Lastly, for the cases when the majority of the data values with a given pressure surface were zero, and there were values between 2 and 5 MPa, the
average pressure was determined by considering these zero data values to be 2 MPa. A fixed support was applied to the distal side of the model, and the resultant reaction force was evaluated to be 1296 N, using the above pressure estimation scheme. This value is approximately twice the 600 N peak reaction force measured in a sheep during a gait cycle [46]. It should be noted that the measurements of [46] were

performed during the gait cycle as the reaction to the total loading on the sheep knee, whereas the reaction force in the present analysis was a result of pressures applied only over the medial part of the plateau. Thus, the present loading case represents a very conservative estimate of the worst case scenario loading, accounting for any sheep to sheep variation in knee loads, or other unknown factors. Reaction forces evaluated at the fixed supports are provided in Table 4.4.

Due to the very complicated plateau surface pattern, the nature of the load played

a critical role on the stability of the implant, not only because of the value and location of the maximum compressive/tensile stresses observed on the CPP implant/Cortical

(Cancellous) interfaces, but also the value and location of interfacial micromotion

89

observed in each individual model. These observations will be presented in detail in
Chapter 5.

4.3

Force applied by Fixation Screw

The fixation screw provided a force that kept the implant attached to the bone,

and which could be conveniently implemented in Ansys using the "bolt force" option. Evaluation of the force applied on the fixation screw was based on axial deformation theory, where the force was evaluated for different geometric misfit values. These values were chosen to be 20, 50, 100, and 200 um. The geometrical misfit is the difference in
length of the screw between the case where the screw head is just snug up against the CPP implant with the cases where the screw is tightened resulting in its length being shortened by the amount assigned.
the bolt force are shown in Fig. 4.4.

The geometric parameters used in the evaluation of

The sum of the axial forces is:

These calculations assumed that the axial force is transmitted to the CPP implant and cancellous bone (Fig. 4.4) through a tube with outer diameter equal to the outer diameter of the screw head (D = 5.6 mm) and the inner diameter equal to the outer diameter of the screw body (d = 3.5 mm).

and are tabulated in Table 4.5.

Treatment of Contact Conditions in Finite Element Analysis

The determination of the best design was greatly affected by the type of contact

selected during the analysis. It was assumed that the contact areas remained well defined during the lifespan of the implant (i.e., the geometrical shape of the CPP remained
unchanged) despite the bone ingrowth process, thus assumed that only the contact

formulation changed as the bone ingrowth process occurred. Contact, combinations used to describe the various situations during the implant life span are listed in table 4.6.

The bonded type contact describes a glued contact where no sliding or separation

between the surfaces is allowed, any existing gap is closed, and all initial penetration is.
In Ansys, No-separation type contact is treated the same as Bonded type, except that a

small amount of frictionless sliding is allowed. For both of the above types of contact the
solution is linear because the contacting surfaces remain unchanged during the FE
solution.

With all other parameters kept unchanged, each CPP implant model was analyzed with the different combinations of contact conditions outlined in Table 4.6. As mentioned in Chapter 1, due to the stress level and micromotion requirements that the implant structure must fulfill, the comparative stage of the design was based on the result of the three contact conditions combinations provided in Table 4.6. These contact conditions approximately reflect the real situation that the CPP implant would encounter during its
life span after the surgical insertion. The material properties of the calcium

polyphosphate implant were assumed to remain constant in the initial stages of bone
ingrowth despite the biodegradation process.

4.4.1

Contact Type selection

There is a variety of contact options available in Ansys to represent the different interface conditions. For bonded and no-separation type contact regions, choosing one

pair of contacts causes the automatic closure of any possible gaps and any penetration is ignored in the analysis. The only difference between the bonded and no-separation type is
that, for the former, the surfaces are glued together (sliding and separation are not

allowed), and for the latter, some small amount of frictionless sliding is allowed between the surfaces. In both bonded and no-separation contacts, separation of the surfaces is not
allowed [44]. For these types of contacts, the solution is linear since the contact areas do
not change during the load application.

When selecting frictionless and frictional type contacts, the contact interfaces

need to be adjusted so that they barely touch. For both of these type of contacts, relative

95

separation of the contact surfaces can occur, and when this happens, the normal pressure is set equal to zero. For the frictionless case, the friction coefficient is considered zero, allowing free sliding between the surfaces. For the frictional case, sliding occurs when

the shear stresses exceed a certain value (determined as a fraction of the contact
pressure). For shear stresses smaller than this value, sticking will occur. For both of

these types of contact, the solution obtained is nonlinear since the surface regions which
are in contact can change during loading [44].

A bonded type contact between the CPP Implant and the cortical and cancellous bone was considered to exist after the surgical insertion of the implant, due to the
presence of the screw. As indicated in [27], bone ingrowth is normally observed within CPP for a period of six weeks after the insertion. Thus, to represent the time span from implantation to six weeks, at the CPP implant-cortical/cancellous bone interfaces, bonded, no-separation and frictionless contact types were compared. The contact

condition of no-separation and frictionless type is used to describe the early stages after the implant insertion. The no-separation type contact leads to smaller solutions time and it is used in the comparative stages of the design. The interfaces between the fixation screw and both the cortical and cancellous bone regions were always represented as bonded, an approximation accounting for the 'bite' of the screw threads. For the screw-CPP implant interface, several conditions were considered. This interface was considered bonded, if the screw was fixed to the CPP

implant with a hole diameter smaller than or equal to the major diameter of the fixation

screw.

If, however, the screw was inserted into the CPP implant with a hole diameter

larger than the major screw diameter, then either no-separation or frictionless type contact conditions were selected. The interface between the fixation screw head-CPP implant was described by a no-separation or friction type contact. For the latter, the

friction coefficient was approximated as the value of the interface between Titanium and wood (another porous cellular material); i.e. n = 0.3 [48], since the true value of the coefficient of friction for interface Titanium-CPP material is unknown. The interface

between cortical and cancellous bone was assumed to be bonded, for all FE simulations.

96

4.4.2

Contact behavior and solution algorithm

Based on Ansys guidelines [44], contact pairs were selected depending on the type of material constituting the pair. Each contact pair, selected manually, was composed of

two surfaces: 'Contact' and 'Target' surfaces which were selected as such based on the guidelines provided in [45], presented as well in the first paragraph of Section 4. The

number of contact surfaces between implant and cortical/cancellous bone was dependent
on the type of keel used (trapezoidal or semi-cylindrical), the size of the keel, and the
position of the keel relative to vertical implant's surface. In a contact pair, the surface

belonging to the softer underlying material was selected to be the 'Contact' surface, while the surface belonging to the stiffer underlying material was selected to be the 'Target' in the contact pair. Besides the interface between cortical and cancellous bone where

symmetric behavior was preferred, for all other interfaces the behavior was selected to be asymmetric ("one- pass contact" where one surface of the contact pair is designated as contact and the other as target). This selection was based on the fact that for this type of behavior, the sliding between the contacting surfaces is better captured using asymmetric type behavior compared to the symmetric type. When the symmetric type of contact is

selected, Ansys generates two (companion) identical contact pairs based on the surfaces chosen, where each pair is identical to the target surface of its companion, and vice versa [42]. The scope mode in Ansys describes the method used in selecting the contact An automatic type was selected for cortical-

surfaces, either manual or automatic.

cancellous bone, fixation screw-Cortical bone, and for fixation screw-Cancellous bone interfaces. For all other interfaces, manual contact regions were preferred, due to the advantages in modeling possible large sliding that this type of contact modeling possesses compared to automatic contact detection [42]. Another reason for use of manual contact is related to the fact that during contact modeling, unnecessary extra surfaces were

observed when initial automatic contact was accomplished by Ansys Workbench for the CPP implant-cortical bone and CPP implant-fixation screw interfaces.

Two solution algorithms were used in this project: the penalty method and
augmented Lagrangian method. The bulk of the analyses were based in the usage of the
Augmented Lagrangian, because it has some advantages over the Penalty method, as

described in Section 2.5. The penalty method was used for comparative purposes, where
the solutions obtained were compared to the solutions obtained using the Augmented Lagrangian method. The difference between the results obtained using these two methods is described in Section 5.2. The solution convergence was heavily dependent on the type of the contact
selected. For the combinations of contact conditions consisting of* only bonded and no

separation, the convergence for the linear solution was obtained based on a' convergence factor of 13% (a convergence factor of smaller than this value was not possible to obtain). For the combination involving the nonlinear effects introduced by the presence of the frictional and frictionless type contacts, the solutions convergence were based on a convergence factor of 20%, and below this value the solution took unrealistically long time to be completed for smaller convergence criteria. During the solution of the

nonlinear type conditions, auto time stepping was introduced into the solution with maximum substep number of 1000 (step size of 100). The adaptive convergence is a

method integrated within the solution process and is based on the error norms and other information output of the solver. It two main option are the refinement loops and depth. Adaptive convergence settings were selected to be at their maximum: refinement loops were selected at ten and the refinement depth at three. These settings for the comparative stages were chosen to be seven and two respectively. The solution for the nonlinear case was obtained for a modified version of the final model shown in Fig. 3.21. The final model shown in Fig. 3.20 did not converge due to the stress concentration observed in the horizontal surfaces near the tip of the keel's

back surface. This type of solution, contact combination 6 and 7 as listed in table 4.6 was
applied only to the final model due to the time required for achieving the converged
solution.

99

4.5

Model Mesh

Meshing of the solid model was accomplished using Solidl87 Ansys elements,

having a tetrahedral shape, and a quadratic displacement behavior. Tetrahedral elements
are well suited to modeling cortical, cancellous, and CPP implants, which possess highly

irregular geometrical shapes. Because Solid 187 elements which were used to mesh the
underlying solids are high-order element (i.e. elements with midside nodes), meshing of

the contact regions was accomplished using 3D 8-Node surface to surface contact
elements (Contactl74) and their associated element 3D target element (Targetl70).

Detailed descriptions of the solid and contact elements can be found in [44]. The accuracy of the analysis is intrinsically related to the accurate finite element
modeling of the contact between the assembly elements, and thus mesh refinement was performed over the contact regions describing the interface between the CPP implant and

the fixation screw, cortical, and cancellous bone.

In Ansys workbench, the 'relevance'

controls the mesh density in a given surface, component, solid, etc. The higher the value of relevance selected, the finer the resulting mesh, giving more accurate results, with a
penalty in the computational speed (maximum relevance is +100). Exploiting all the elements limited by the FE package license (maximum of 125,000 nodes or elements),

meshing of the cortical, cancellous bone, and CPP implant was performed with the
relevance value set at -50 (-100 for high speed and +100 for high accuracy). The relevance of the fixation screw was left at the default value (zero relevance). Then the

contact regions mentioned above were refined with the following element sizes for the

maximum mesh density: CPP implant-Cortical bone contact region having an element
size of 0.5 mm, CPP implant-Cancellous bone with 0.6 mm, and for the fixation screw ^ *

CPP implant contact region, the refining was done with contact element size of 0.65 mm. Contact regions between the fixation screw- cortical /cancellous bone, and the region between cancellous-cortical bones were left unchanged from the mesh density

constructed with the initial relevance. The dependency of the solution from mesh density
is the treated in section 5.2. '

100

Tables 4.8 and 4.9 show the types and the number of elements used in meshing

the solid models and contact regions for the two extreme cases. The first is the case with the minimum possible relevance, with no refinement introduced into the assembly, and
the second represents the maximum possible mesh density achievable with the limits on
the Ansys license.

The number of nodes for the FE model with a minimum mesh density was 35,801 and the overall number of active elements was 26,683. For the maximum mesh density
FE model, where the refinement of the contact region was completed, the overall number
of elements was 95,428 (including solid and contact elements) and the number of nodes was 124,056. These statistics correspond to the FE modeling of the CPP implant where

the cartilage layer was not included. Information regarding the modeling of the cartilage
layer is provided in Chapter 6.

Finite Element Analysis Results and Discussions

108

In this chapter, the derivation of the optimal geometrical shape through finite element analysis results will be presented. There are several factors considered during the design including geometrical, formulation characteristics such as various contact type
implementations, and surgeon preferences. The initial design stage of the project is presented in section 5.1, where the design
was based upon the whole medial side of the tibia. The design of the model based on the partial medial part of the tibia was based upon surgeon preferences. input is related to the geometrical shape of the keel analyzed. Another surgeon

5The preference was

towards a geometrical shape which was easy to be generated over the bone in real surgical conditions. Therefore a keel with geometrical shape which would imitate the

imprint left by a simple vertical movement of the surgical drill bit was analyzed. This
analysis is presented in section 5.2, where several FE analyses were conducted with the purpose of gathering information about the implant behavior over different stages of bone healing. Investigation was also conducted towards the possibility of the use of

biodegradable screw instead of surgical titanium screw, which would have led to a total
biodegradable implanting process.

Reliability of the solutions obtained was the focus of the section 5.3.

In this

section, the solution based upon maximum and minimum parameters value (such as stress, reaction force, etc.), and for values at specific locations (use of probes) was analyzed for different element size. The experimental analysis was conducted on the final model of the design, and the result and considerations are presented in section 5.4. In this section, a FE model was constructed approximately to the assembly of the experimental model, for comparison
purposes.

Figure 5. 2 Failure location of model with keel oriented at 30° angle.
Combination 2

Figures 5.3 and 5. 4 indicate that failure for the models was encountered at the

frontal part of the keel at the interface with the cortical bone, such as in the case of the

90° oriented keel and at the interface between screw head and the CPP implant interface
such as in the case of 20° angle oriented keel. Similar to the 20° angle oriented implant, the 40° oriented implant experienced the same failure location. Failure location for the 0°
angle oriented keel model is at the ventral part at the interface between the implant and
cancellous bone.

It can be concluded that for each of the orientations, the location of the highest
stress, and consequently the location of the failure, can be uniquely related to the keel orientation itself. It can be concluded that each model, due to a combination of keel

orientation, complex load applied, and complex geometrical shape of upper surface where the load is applied, contributes uniquely to the failure mode of the CPP implant
structure.

5.1.2

Straight oriented keel model Based on the results listed in 5.1 and 5. 2 and on the surgeon preference of having

a implant insertion on ventral-dorsal direction, the focus of the design was shifted to improve the design of the zero keel orientation angle implant. Keel location played a very important role in the stability of the implant structure. Implants that have a geometrical shape whose data are listed at the first row of Tables 5.1

and 5.2 have the keel positioned at a distance of 4 mm from the vertical surface (see
Figure 3.18). This was the minimum possible distance that could be used due to the presence of the patellar tendon at the ventral side affecting the position of the keel. Maintaining the keel width unchanged, increasing the keel distance from the vertical surface from a value of 4 mm to 6 mm caused an increase of the x-axis normal stress to a value of 38 Mpa which is beyond the tensile strength of the CPP material (Fig.

5.5). Therefore, the base width of the trapezoid was increased to 12 mm and the distance from the vertical face was maintained at 4 mm. The FE results for first two contact
combination for the new model are listed in Table 5.3.

The increase of the size of the keel had a direct impact in the implant performance
when compared with the data listed in the first row of Table 5.2. There is no presence of

high compressive and tensile stresses that was found in the model with the thinnSr keel.
The figures 5.6 and 5.7 show the normal stress distribution in the x and z directions.

Implant Design: Comparative Stage with Semi-Circular Cross Section Keel.

In this section, the focus of the analysis is the design of the implant based on e
determining the optimal shape of the implant by trying to minimize the amount of the removed bone while ensuring a stable and strong implant structure. Determination of the optimal design was achieved by the investigation of the effect of several factors: keel length and associated screw angle for various keel sizes (Section 5.2.1), keel width (Section 5.2.2), screw insertion force (Section 5.2.3), and the possibility of the use of a
biodegradable screw (Section 5.2.4). >

5.2.1

Effect of keel width and screw angle insertion

As seen in the Section 5.1, the keel width made a large difference in the resulting

stresses, for the trapezoidal cross section keel. To determine whether a similar trend held for keels of semi-circular cross section, models having keel diameters of 12, 10, and 8 mm, were analyzed. On the dorsal end of the keel, to properly match the groove left by a simple vertical movement of a drill bit by the surgeon, a half cone was attached, to imitate the drill bit tip shape. The length of the implant's keel was adjusted according to

the screw angle insertion.

For screw angles of 10, 15, and 20°, the keel length was

adjusted so that the screw hole exited in the conical part of the keel, resulting in keel

lengths of 20.5, 17.5, and 13.5 mm, respectively. Note that this keel length corresponds
to the maximum length of the keel; i.e. the distance from the most ventral part of the keel

to the tip of the half cone in the dorsal position.

A variation of 2° in the screw angle was

allowed, for each of the angles considered in the analysis, to ensure that the screw did not
exit the implant on the horizontal surface or within the keel cylinder. Failure conditions

are created by such an exit, as shown in Figure 5.11, where the tensile stress in the X
direction (maximum of 45 MPa) greatly exceeded the tensile strength of the CPP ceramic material (28 MPa). Figure 5.12 shows the state of shear stress in the X-Z plane. For the situation shown in the mentioned figures the contact condition 1 (from Table 4.6) was used in the solution of the FE model.

The results listed in Table 5.5 suggest that an increase in keel length does not guarantee an increase in the structural bulk strength. For example, while the implant with keel length of 13.5 mm experiences an increase in overall normal tensile stresses in all directions, the implant with keel length of 17.55 mm concentrations of high stress are observed along the keel's dorsal side near the level of horizontal surface as shown in
Figures 5.14 and 5.15. The same conclusion can be reached by examining the result for

the models with keel diameters of 8 and 10 mm (Tables 5.6 and 5.7). Compared to the model with a keel diameter of 12 mm (Table 5.5), the 8 and 10 mm diameter models
result in very similar tensile stress distributions, reflected in the similar safety factor values. The only parameter that changed significantly with keel diameter was the amount of the sliding distance occurring along the implant's contact. For example, the sliding

distance for the implant with 10 mm keel diameter increases from the model with keel diameter 12 mm by an amount of 640 %. The same increase in sliding distance is experienced by the implant with keel diameter 8 mm which the increase is 690 %. These increases are observed for contact combination 2, and not for contact combination 1. For all-bonded type contact simulations, the amount of the sliding was well within the threshold value, but for the all-no-separation type contacts the sliding increased greatly.

For the 8 and 10 mm keel diameters, the sliding distances in all simulations, for
no-separation type contact, exceeded the allowable value by an amount ranging from 200% to more than 500%. The most stable implant had a keel diameter and length of 20.5 mm and 12 mm (Table 5.5), respectively. Despite the fact that the safety factor dropped bek>w one

for the contact combination 2 (Fig. 5.16), the micromotion remained well under the threshold. It was thus decided to use these measurements as a base for further

improvement of the design, which represents the subject of the following section. The following section discusses the improvement of this design.

Modified implant: Final Modelling Stage.

Investigation of the implant structure behavior in the initial phase just after the insertion into the host bone represents a very important step in determining the
effectiveness of the design. In the previous comparative modeling stages, only the first two contact combinations listed in Table 4.6 were used to establish the best overall geometrical shape (i.e., keel size, location, shape, etc) for the implant . During these

preliminary analyses, the types of contact considered were glued (bonded) and sliding without contact separation (no-separation). These linear analyses allowed a fast and

reasonably reliable confidence in the accuracy of the solution, which was important considering the large number of models that were considered. To have a more complete picture of the performance of the selected design, and to
simulate the contact conditions which the implant would encounter immediately after its insertion, the use of a frictionless type contact is more appropriate. By imposing into the

assembly this type of contact, the system of equations describing the FE model becomes nonlinear, due to the fact that not only sliding but contact separation is allowed. As
explained in Section 4.4.1, because the friction coefficient of the CPP material when in contact with cortical and cancellous bone has never been measured, a worst case frictionless condition was assumed. For the case of the contact between the bone and

fixation screw, a similar problem arose, and the coefficient of friction was approximated by the value for contact between titanium with wood (i.e., 0.3). Using frictionless contact conditions with the implant having the base geometry as determined from Section 5.2.1 (i.e., the most promising design, having a keel diameter and length of 20.5 mm and 12 mm, respectively) resulted in nqn convergence of the

solution. This was due to the sharp corner at the tip of the conical shaped dorsal part of the keel (see Figure 3.19). Therefore, as discussed in Section 3.2, a modification to the

dorsal side of the keel was made whieh not only ensured the convergence of the nonlinear contact problem, but also resulted in a slight improvement in the performance of the
structure. In this modified model (Fig. 3.21), the sharp corner was eliminated, and the

model converged for the frictionless contact case.

A summary of the results for the modified models is shown in Tables 5.8 and 5.10
for all contact combinations listed in Table 4.6.

For contact combination 7, the location of the highest shear stress the dorsal side keel surface, as shown in Figure 5.27.

occurred on

The largest sliding distance

occurred at the dorsal keel surface/cancellous bone interface, in the location which is
shown in Figure 5.23. The location of maximum normal stress in the y-direction coincided with the elastic stress intensity (which represent the stress at a point due to pressure from combined tensile and compressive stresses), and maximum shear stress as shown by Figures 5.22, 5.26, and 5.27, respectively. The same, regarding the locations of
the maximum values of the stress and sliding distance, also holds for contact combination 6, the only difference being that the values are 7% and 22 % smaller, respectively, than

contact combination 7 (see Table 5.10).
As described in Section 4.4, the early stages of the implant life span are described by two type of contacts: no-separation and frictionless. For combination 3 and 7, the

contacts between the CPP implant and the other assembly elements are solely described by these two types of contacts. Ansys predicts similar tensile response, which is reflected by a similar value of the safety factor based on the maximum stress theory. The differences are in the maximum values of the stresses in compression where the normal stress in y-direction is 62 % higher for the combination 7. Shear stress in the xy-plane is 50 % higher in the combination 7, while the stresses in the other plane are equal. Use of the bonded type contact in one or more CPP implant contact interfaces, improved the stress distribution and overall performance of the implant. This is reflected by the smooth distribution of the stress over the implant structure which is shown by the

high values of all three safety factors evaluated (Table 5.8). The shear safety factor and the maximum stress distributions over the CPP for contact combination 5 are shown in Figures 5.20 and 5.21 indicating the location of elevated stress levels.
Figures 5.24 and 5.25 show the directional and total deformation of the implant for contact combination 7. hi comparison with other contact combinations, the direction

of the deformation changes not only on the location of the occurrence of these maximum
deformations but as well in the value.

5.2.3

Use of a biodegradable screw
In the original design, it was assumed that the implant would be initially fixed

using a titanium screw, to be removed after some bone ingrowth occurred.

A more

desirable situation would be the use of a biodegradable screw, which would not require a
second surgery to remove the screw. Therefore, an analysis of the assembly using a

biodegradable fixation screw was also performed. The fixation screw was assumed to be of the same CPP material as the implant, and the same contact conditions were implemented except combination 6. The analysis with the biodegradable fixation screw was conducted for the 6 combinations listed in Table 4.6. A summary of the stress

results with biodegradable screw are listed in Table 5.12 and the maximum sliding distances are listed in Table 5.11.

For all contact combinations except for combination 1, failure of the implant or fixation screw due to elevated stress would be expected to occur, or unacceptable sliding

distances were observed, as can be seen in Tables 5.11 and 5.12. As examples, the
distributions of the sliding distances of the CPP implant for two contact combinations are shown in Figures 5.28 and 5.29. The corresponding stress distributions over the contact

surfaces of the implant are shown in Figures 5.30 and 5.31, in which the location of the

maximum stresses are seen to occur at the screw exit on the dorsal side of the keel.

The safety factors in Table 5.12 show that the performance of the CPP implant CPP fixation screw in terms of stress considerations alone was comparable with the
system utilizing a titanium screw for contact combinations 1, 4 and 5. Fracture of the

implant was expected to occur in contact combinations 2 and 3, while the fracture of the
screw was expected only in the combination 7. The location of the expected fracture in

the biodegradable screw for combination 7 is shown in Figure 5.32, where the stress is
seen to be discontinuous at the boundary between the red and orange colored areas at where the screw exits the implant.
The other factor under consideration was the micromotion (sliding distance)

occurring in the implant-bone interfaces. As can be seen in Table 5.11, only the sliding
distance for contact combination 1 (48 (im) is below the critical value of 50 |im. All

other contact

combinations

resulted

in

sliding

distances

that

were

between

76%

(combination 2) to 400% (combination 7) above this critical value. This effect is
attributed to the contact formulation for the bonded type which resulted in a more uniformly distributed stress distribution along the contact areas. Overall, it can thus be

concluded that the performance of the implant with a CPP fixation screw was acceptable
only for contact combination 1.

Dependency of implant performance on titanium screw tightening force

Discussions with the surgeon on the research team revealed that the torque

applied while tightening implant screws is generally not controlled carefully, and
therefore the resulting tensile force within the screw can potentially vary significantly from surgeon to surgeon A number of analyses were thus performed to determine what

effect, if any, that this screw force might have on the stress distribution in, and sliding distance of, the CPP implant. For this purpose, contact combination 3 was used and the
FE analysis was conducted over several values of screw force values. The contact

combination 3 was selected for this type of analysis due to the fact that with this type of contact describes the contact conditions just after implant insertion and requires less time
to achieve a solution compared to the contact combination 1. A summary of the results
appears in Table 5.13

For fixation forces less than 75 N, the performance of the implant was essentially
independent of bolt force. This is indicated by the relatively constant values of stresses in
tension or compression and the identical safety factors shown in Table 5.13.However, for higher screw forces, the performance of the system deteriorated, as can be seen by the dramatically increasing stress values for an applied load of 320 and 810 N. In these

cases, the tensile stresses in the Z and X directions exceeded the tensile strength of the CPP material, indicating that fracture of the implant would likely occur. As shown in Figure 5.33, for a screw force of 320 N, the location of the expected failure was at the horizontal surface near the keel indicated by the low value of safety factor (red zone). For the force of 810 N the location was shifted to the screw exit at the back surface.

Implementation of Orthotropic bone properties.

All analyses performed thus far had as their aim to determine the optimal shape and configuration of the implant, and used isotropic material properties. Using the final optimized geometry presented in Section 5.2.2, orthotropic material properties (Table 4.2) were considered for both the cortical and cancellous bone, in an effort to obtain a better estimate of implant behavior under real conditions. A cylindrical coordinate system was used with the axial, tangential and radial directions aligned with the z, y, and x directions, respectively, and the transversely isotropic properties of the cortical bone were
applied based on this coordinate system. The anisotropic properties of the cancellous

bone were applied based upon the global coordinate system with the proximal-distal, medial-lateral, and dorsal-ventral directions aligned with z, y, and x axes respectively.
A summary of the results for the FE solutions are shown in Tables 5.14and 5.14

respectively, together with the results for the isotropic case as a comparison. The analysis
with the anisotropic properties was accomplished over only the first five contact type
combinations listed in the tables.

The sliding distances estimated for the cases where the anisotropic bone material properties were implemented are very similar to the values of the isotropic case. There is
no significant difference on the contact combinations implemented. For all contact

combinations, Ansys returned almost identical values which indicate that the assumption
of isotropy in determination of the best design and stated by [39] is an accurate and fair
assumption.

Figure 5.34 Sliding distances for anisotropic bone material properties

The main difference between the isotropic and anisotropic model results was in the stress distribution over the structure. For the anisotropic case, the stresses were

generally slightly higher, resulting in a direct impact on the safety factor estimation, which were lower compared to the isotropic case for each contact combination analyzed. As mentioned previously, because in the loads used were extremely conservative, there was enough confidence that the selected model was adequate. The verification of this

model was the subject of the experimental analysis presented in section 5.4.

5.3

Accuracy of the Solution

The accuracy of the solution for a particular FE model depends to some extent on

how well the FE model describes the actual geometry of the implant. The FE description
of the geometrical model, however, depends on the number of elements used in the meshing process. The scope of the present section was the variation of the results returned by the FE simulation with an increase in the mesh density (decrease of the
elements size). For this purpose the analysis was performed with five element sizes: 1.5, 0.2, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.6 mm, denoted by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively in the figures in
this section.

The variations of the stresses with the mesh density is shown in Figures 5.35
through 5.39 for contact combination 3 in Table 4.6, while the variation of reaction forces

acting upon the contact interface of CPP implant with the bone elements, acting on the
centroids of contact areas, are shown in Figures 5.38 through 5.40. Convergence of the solution, based upon element size (a decreasing

difference in successive stress values with decreasing element size which was selected at
5%) was generally achieved for most of the parameters analyzed. Nevertheless, some of the parameters seemed to oscillate, such as the case of the shear stress on the yz-plane in

Figure 5.36. Another example is the variation of the reaction force acting upon the keel's
surface on the dorsal side where the increase of the number of elements result in the

continuous decrease of the reaction force as shown in Figure 5.40.
For both situations mentioned above, the solution was not considered converged

because the these parameters change by 17 % and 15 % respectively, relative to global convergence norm set at 13 %. The same type of analysis was conducted over specific points of the CPP implant contact surface with cancellous and cortical bone. Further investigation was restricted by

the element/node number retained by the Ansys license, nevertheless the results obtained
the information obtained was abundant and convincing for the accuracy of the solution

Experimental Verification

The final stage of the design consisted of an attempt at experimentally verifying

the finite element model. An implant, derived directly from CAD files of the final
implant (Section 5.2) was manufactured using advanced numerical machining methods by research partners at the University of Waterloo on supervision of Dr. Erkormaz. A

sheep tibia, to which the implant was secured, was obtained from research partners at Mt. Sinai hospital in Toronto. The bone preparation for implant hosting and the implant

insertion was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. P. Zalzal. The author potted the bone distally (Figure 5.41), and attached two strain gauges, and an instrumented compression
test was performed using an Instron universal testing machine at the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Toronto, with the assistance of Dr. J. Wang.

Procedure

Figure 5.41 Experimental set-up showing potted sheep tibia with attached strain gauges in Instron Universal Testing Machine

The first step in the model preparation for testing was the insertion of the

provided CPP implant into the hosting bone, as shown in Figure 5.41.

To accomplish

fixation, a screw with 3 mm diameter was used. As can be seen from Figure 5.42, there

was a large mismatch between the hosting bone and the CPP model because of the fact that the implant was derived from a different sized sheep tibial plateau than that which wa's provided for this test. Such large specimen to specimen variations in bone size and

material properties are an unfortunate reality in biological testing.

158

The bone was potted distally to a height 40 mm using Cerobend, a metal alloy of

bismuth, lead, tin, and cadmium with a melting temperature of 70°C, to provide a well
defined zero displacement boundary condition in the FE model, and a stably fixated bone for the testing. The potting of the bone into the container was facilitated by the use of a
commercial gas torch.

Figure 5.42 CPP implant attached to the host bone.

Three locations were chosen for the attachment of the strain gauges, two on the
medial side and one in the dorsal side. Figure 5.43 shows the locations and number convention of the gauges on the medial side. Both gauges attached in the medial side were located 17 mm from the vertical surface of the CPP implant, and with the of 4 mm

distance from the horizontal surface (mid axis of the gauge).

The attachment procedure of the strain gauges included the standard decreasing,
abrading, and conditioning of the attachment location. Initial attempts at attachment were

not successful due to the fact that the M-200 bond adhesive did not stay at the implant

159

surface, but quickly disappeared into the highly porous CPP ceramic material.

This

obstacle was overcome by the application of a very thin layer of plaster of Paris at the
application site, followed by abrading of the areas where the plaster was applied. In The
gauges were oriented in the proximal-distal direction.

Figure 5.43 also shows the pressure jig; consisting of resin material used in
cosmetic dentistry, which was used in order to have a uniform pressure distribution over

the implant surface, thus avoid any possible local fracture on the upper surface of the
implant. The pressure jig was produced with the generous assistance of the

Orthodenstitry laboratory of the University of Toronto, Faculty of the Dentistry. During this procedure, unfortunately, the pressure gauge attached to the dorsal side of the implant was accidentally removed from its attachment location due to the very tight space
in which the operation of generating the pressure jig occurred. The experimental results will therefore be considered only for the two gauges attached on the medial side.

Experimental Procedure and Results

As shown in Figure 5.44, the force exerted by the actuator was applied through the pressure jig over the upper surface of the CPP implant and the strain measurements
were registered by the data acquisition system. The force was applied with a step

actuator displacement rate of 0.2 mm/min to a maximum load of 650 N. Load and strain measurements as a function of time are shown in Figures 5.44 - 5.46.

Discussion of the experimental results

Visual inspection of the implant after the experiment did not reveal any damage to

the CPP implant.

Given that the maximum load applied, exceeded

the reaction force

registered for the sheep's gait cycle measurement [46] as mentioned in Section 4.2, this
was an encouraging indication that the design was sound.

Analyzing the strain data experienced by the two gauges, from Figures 5 A3 and
5.45, it can be seen that while gauge 1 experienced only compression, gauge 2

experienced a tensile load as well. The load transmitted through the resin pressure jig was

applied through a surface 258 mm2. Initially gauge 1 experienced a tensile load which
decreased as the applied load increased, until the applied load reached 37.81 N (0.154

MPa) value

for which this

gauge

sensed compression. This gauge

continued to

experience compression until the load was increased to 416.3 N (1.61 MPa) from which

point the strain that this gauge sensed was again tensile.

Saturation of the gauge was

experienced when the load was increased to 604.5 N value (2.34 MPa).

The scale applicable to the reading is that the gauge is a reading of 1000 [i when
the value obtained is 5. Thus, at the maximum load applied (650 N) the readings of the

gauges 1 and 2 are 340 u£ (compression) and 1.16x10 ~3 (tension).
A direct comparison between the existing FE models already investigated and the experimental model cannot be conducted. As mentioned before, there was a noticeable

difference between the assemblies due to the fact that the hosting bone was considerably larger than the original bone used to design the CPP implant (which resulted in a perfect match with the hosting bone). This difference in the volume occupied by the CPP implant relative to the removed volume of the hosting bone caused the contact surface between
the implant and cortical/cancellous bone to be greatly affected. Despite these discrepancies, the fact that the designed implant did not experienced failure indicates that the CPP implant designed displays considerable structural strength.

5.4.5

FE approximation of experimental model

An effort to approximate the experimental model with an FE model was made. To build the solid model of the tested bone would have required construction using CT scans, which were not available for the tibial host bone. The FE model was thus based on the pictures taken of the experimental bone assembly. Therefore, CAD modeling of the
new FE model was accomplished with the same procedure mentioned in Chapter 3. The

surface manipulations were conducted in the Rhinoceros 3.0 CAD modeling software, and consisted in the expansion of the dorsal cortical surfaces (inner and outer surfaces), expansion of the proximal tibia plateau surfaces, and expansion of the ventral side. The end result of the CAD modeling is shown in Figure 5.47.

In the model shown above, all the approximations of the CPP implant with

this section.

The location of the probes is shown in figures 5.48 and 5.49 the result at the desired location can be determined only by variations within a certain range and not by
an exact value.

All the data listed in the Table 5.15 and the strain distributions shown in the in the Figures 5.50 - 5.52 are based on the simulations with contact combination 3. Due to the

time required in the solution of the model with contact combination 7, it was not possible to present the results for that type of analysis.

Based on Table 5.4.1, both gauges experienced compression at the locations of the probes with an increase of the load generally, all but one of the probe, follow .the same pattern. It seems that a different pattern was observed for probe 3 at probe group 2 where for an increase of the load from 1.61 to 2.54 MPa, the strain is decreased by 30 %. For probe group 1, all probes experience the same increase in strain (56 %) which is the same as the load increase. The same assertion can be made for all the probes of the probe
group 2, with the exception of two highlighted probes, namely probes 3 and 4. The increase of the load from 1.6 MPa to 2.54 MPa (59 %) the probe number 3 experience

and increase of 300 % in strain while probe number 4 experience a drop of 30 %.

5.4.6

Comparison of Experimental and FE results. Experimental strain results show that for a load of 650 N, gauge 2 became

saturated after it experiences a shift in the nature of load it encounters. Initially the load is tensile with a decreasing trend, experiencing compression from a load of 38 N until
416 N. The positive strain increases until saturation is reached at 650 N. Gauge 1 experiences only compression with a maximum value of 340 u£. FE analysis reveals that
both probes experience compression with the trends that are explained in Section 5.4.5. There is a large disagreement between these two models especially in the

behavior of the gauge 2 for which the FE does not estimate a tensile type loading at the

location of the probe. For gauge 1, at load values of 38 N (0.15 MPa) and 416 N (1.61
MPa) the strain readings are 11 and 139 u£ respectively. Using probe tool 1

(corresponding to strain gauge 1), for 38 N and 416 N applied load, probe 2 gave 24 u£

and 234 (xe compression, respectively, and probe 5 gave 33 u£ and 329 u.£ respectively.
The FE analysis overestimates the state of strain at this region by between 68 and 200 %. There are several possible reasons for the poor agreement between experiment

and model, and the

bizarre behavior of gauge 2. There is the possibility that the use of

the thin layer of plaster of Paris to prevent strain gauge glue absorption may have affected the results, because it may have cracked below the strain gauge. Another possible reason is the alternation of the mechanical properties of the bone due to the
elevated temperature seen by the bone during the potting of the bone into the container.

Another factor is the notoriously large experimental scatter in bone material properties,
depending on its age, quality, specimen sex, etc. Also, during the FE simulations, a

fixation force of 75 N was applied, which in reality may differ from the actual force
exerted by the surgeon during the implant insertion.

Another factor of great importance is the type of contact between the bone and

CPP implant implemented in the FE model. To the author's knowledge, there is no information related to the friction coefficient of CPP with cortical and cancellous bone,
so that the no-separation type contact was applied in the model. Furthermore, the contact

areas between cortical and cancellous bone were visually estimated due to the misfit of
the bone with the implant, and therefore the exact contact areas and their ratio between

the assembly elements are not known. And lastly, a major factor affecting especially the

169

behavior of gauge 2 was the geometrical mismatches between bone and implant which were not considered during the FE analysis due to time limitations. As shown highlighted in blue in Figure 5.53 there was a gap between the cortical bone and the horizontal surface of the CPP, which was not implemented in the analysis and most likely greatly affected the results. Bone to implant mismatch is a major problem which the research

team will have to address in the future, perhaps by custom making implants for a
particular patient.

Finite Element Modeling of Articular Cartilage

171

FE methods have been widely used in the modeling of the cartilage layer, and this process has evolved from the single phase linear modeling to a biphasic analytical model. Modeling of the cartilage as a single linearly elastic material is valid only at the equilibrium when all the fluid flow ceases and in the situations where at the instant the load application the fluid has not yet start flowing. At every other instance under load,
the cartilage exhibits high viscous effects.

Nowadays there are many prevailing theories which describe the behavior of the

articular cartilage. They are divided into a number of groups, the first of which includes Biphasic and Poroviscoelastic theories. Despite the fact that both of these theories started from different roots, they reach the same conclusion. Both the theories can be used to

describe not linear and nonlinear behavior of the cartilage.

The other group is comprised of viscoelasticity and hyperviscoelasticity. In this project, the modeling of the cartilage layer was based in the second group.

6.1

Articular Cartilage Modeling:

According to quasi-linear viscoelasticity theory (Fung theory) the stress relaxation

function can be separated into two parts: time dependent and elastic portion which gives
[48]:

(6.1)

where the total stress relaxation function K depends on both time and the stretch ratio X,
given by elastic response T6 and the reduced relaxation function W. The time dependent
strain energy function of the cartilage can be expressed by the two term Prony series in
the relaxation form as:

,("*,·)

(6.2)

172

In formula (6.2), Wo represents the instantaneous strain energy function prior for the
incompressible materials, ii and x2 are the short and long term relaxation time constants

and A, and A2 are the relaxation magnitudes for short and long term.

The instantaneous strain energy function can be modeled by a three parameter
hyperelastic Mooney-Rivlin material model as follows:

(6.3)

where the Qo, On, and Cn

are the coefficients that need to be determined

experimentally, and coefficients Ii and b are the first and second invariants of the right Cauchy deformation tensor. In the case of a creep test, the creep compliance J(t) is given
by:

= J(t)-<70

(6.4)

Creep compliance function can be expressed in the form Prony series:

J(t) = Do\ 1-2, pl'(l-e

(6.5)

In this project the determination of the Prony terms were acquired using a standard nonlinear regression method (the Marquardt-Levenberg method). For a given set of
experimental data x, and ys, the nonlinear regression method approximates an error

function (02) with respect to some unknown constants which are defined as:

yi-y(xi,a)
(7,

(6.6)

173

where Oj is the standard deviation of the measurement error of i-th data point. A set of
unknowns constants a will be determined that minimize the error function given by
eq.(6.6), which can be approximated by its Taylor series of the quadratic form:

-

(6.7)

Where 'd' is the gradient of the error function with respect to 'a' which will be
minimized. Elements of the matrix D are the second order partial derivative of the error

function with respect to parameters 'a'. Final values of parameters 'a' are obtain by inserting into the nonlinear regression algorithm initial values which will be ultimately
improved.

For linear viscoelastic material, a superposition of hereditary integrals describes

the time dependent response. For a load applied at time t=0 with, the variation of strain
at time t+At is given by:

(6.8)

Loading of the creep experiment can be divided into two time segments which are given
by the following discretized stress function:

oft) :=

i

11

(tl - tO) JJ
0 otherwise

if 0 < t < 11

((ol)) if tl <t<t2
(6.9)

The hereditary integrals with Prony series kernels given by eq. (6.8) can be applied to model a loading process of the creep experiment in the following way. By assuming that
strain at t=0 is e0 =^(o) = Oand by assuming that the load requires a certain time t, to
reach the constant applied load, equation (6.8) takes the form:

174

£\t) = >

-((-£.)/
= 0

+0

(6.11)

t\~

(6.12)

This equation is valid only for the time interval t, - t2. In the same way as the equation (6.8) is transformed to equation (6.12). The same integration scheme can be implemented
for the interval to-ti resulting in :

-C-'i,)/

, Ar,

-t/

(6.13)

Because the number of equations is 2 the number of the variables in the nonlinear

regression algorithm is 2n+l, therefore several constraint conditions must be
implemented.

D, > 0

(6.14)

The nonlinear regression method was implemented in MathCAD software (Mathsoft Inc.,

Cambridge, Ma) where the procedure is provided in the Appendices. Because only the
creep data were known (no relaxation) this algorithm was used in determining the 1 term

Prony series. (Pi and x,). These parameters were then used to obtain the relaxation form of
the Prony series as described by [49], and implemented in the simplified FE model of the
cartilage layer. The hyperelastic, three parameter Mooney-Rivlin material was utilized to

represent the solid fibers of the cartilage layer [49]. The data of the 1 term Prony series
and the data obtained from [49] for the hyperelastic model are listed in Table 6.1.

Finite Element Modeling of Cartilage

Finite element analysis of the bone assembly with cartilage layers included was not completed. Instead the analysis was accomplished on a very simplified assembly
including cortical bone and the cartilage layer.

There were several reasons that the analysis was not completed with the real

model. The main reason was the limited number of elements, causing the presence of elements with poor shape in the cartilage layers volumes, which when combined with the
very complicated geometrical shape, required a large number of elements to be modeled. This fact left no possibility of improving the poorly shaped elements. The other
possibility to overcome this limitation was the use of superelements which, however,was

restricted because of the fact that in the creation

of the Matrix 50 element, all the

elements need to be defined and all volumes need to be meshed. Nevertheless, several
attempts at generation of the superelement failed due to the restricted number of degrees

of freedom allowed by the Ansys license. Due to the nonlinear characteristics of the analysis at hand, 6 DOF are required ,leaving little possibility for success. In Figure 6.1 is

176

shown the bone assembly in Ansys. Every element was imported individually with facet

option on, ensuring prior to the import in IGS format that all elements had the same defined coordinate system. Cortical, cancellous, fixation screw and CPP implant were
modeled with element type SOLID 92 while meshing of cartilage layers was

accomplished with element type SOLID 187. Problematic features that the cartilage layer exhibits are related to the its geometrical shape having an height of 0.4 mm and covering the entire surface of the tibia resulting in
87 element with poor geometrical shape.

Therefore, the analysis was shifted to a cylindrical shaped of height of 0.6 mm solid for

shown in figure 6.2

177

Meshing of the simplified model was done with SOLID 92 for the cortical bone

and meshing for the cartilage was done with SOLID 187. A static analysis was implemented for cartilage layer: linear viscoelasticity (small strain viscoelasticity) and
hyper-viscoelastic. This was accomplished by the model combination available in Ansys. For both types of simulations the Kevin-Voigt model was adopted. The contact between

cartilage layer and cortical bone was treated as 'bonded always' type, not allowing any
type of relative movement

Concluding Remarks and Future Work

179

7.1

Conclusions

A 3-dimensional solid model of the sheep's tibia bone was constructed based on

the provided CT scans. This model was used to generate the solid model of a
biodegradable CPP implant of the medial side of the tibial plateau, which is used as an
anchorage structure in the restoration of damaged cartilage layer in synovial joints. The purpose of this investigation was the determination of the optimal structural
shape which would address the two main requirements that a structure of this nature

needed to satisfy: sufficient bulk strength of the implant and only a limited amount of
allowed micromotion.

The overall stability and strength of the implant structure depended on many

factors which were considered: keel orientation cross-sectional geometry and dimensions,

fixation screw length, screw angle insertion, fixation screw force, and overall implant
height.

Implant height was maintained constant throughout project, due to assumptions

related to the area of the cartilage layer being repaired covering the entire medial tibial plateau. Keel orientation, the angle that the keel axis creates with the ventral-dorsal
direction, was found to be a very important parameter in implant design. However, there
was not an apparent clear pattern that related the implant performance to the orientation.

For each individual keel angle, the failure modes were unique to that orientation, with locations of destructive tensile and compressive stresses characteristic only for that
specific angle.

Keel dimensions, and more specifically keel cross-sectional dimensions, had a great effect in the overall stability of the implant structure. Two cross-sectional shapes

were investigated: trapezoidal and semicircular. For both shapes, as the cross-sectional
area of the keel was increased, the stresses and bone/implant relative sliding distances

decreased, indicating a stronger and more stable implant. The shape of the final design was based not only on the performance in terms of strength and stability, but also on the
easy of implantation.

The screw angle of insertion did not greatly affect the stress distribution on the implant structure. For the angles investigated, the variation of stresses was very small,

never leaving to implant failure based upon this parameter alone; however screw angle

insertion was strongly associated with the keel length due to the requirement of where the
screw exiting had to exit.

Keel length played a very important role in the performance of the implant. The

final design was based on the longest possible keel, however an increase in keel length
did not necessarily imply improvement of the performance, as the analysis for three
different keel length showed.

Another factor that was analyzed was the screw insertion force. The implant

performance was not affected by this force until it reached a value of 160 N. A further increase beyond this value causes the appearance of high and possibly destructive
stresses.

The analysis of the FE results for assessing the possibility of implementing a totally biodegradable implant (use of biodegradable screw) showed that it is not feasible.
Finally, the experimental verification showed that the implant displayed as a very

robust behavior, experiencing no fracture even though applied load was several times higher than that to which it would naturally be exposed. The experimental results did

not match those predicted by the FE mainly because of mismatch between the tested bone, and that for which the implant was originally designed, which was much smaller
than that used in the test.

7.2

Future work

The work involved in this project has also lead to specific recommendations for
improvement in future work related to the design of models of biodegradable structures.
Such recommendations include:

1) The accuracy of the measured distributed load applied over the tibia plateau needs to be improved. Because of the lower threshold with
pressure sensitive files, it is not possible to measure load lower than 2
MPa, resulting in a significant uncertainty in applied load.

2) The performance of the implant is strongly related to the type of contact conditions implemented. The accurate assessment of the bone ingrowth
rate would lead to a better specification of these contact conditions as a
function of time.
3) During the experimental set up the cut on the bone was L

visual comparison between the solid model and the sheep's tibia. Further more the cut was accomplished by an electrical jigsaw. Application of sophisticated cutting tools such as laser operating cutters, would

significantly improve the quality. The cut on the host bone which directly
not only affect the initial performance of the implant by providing a better

fit with the implant but as well prevent the bone to grow over the cartilage

compromising the very purpose this procedure is being implemented. Another effect of this kind of improvement is that it would easy the

surgical procedure that the surgeon has to perform. The implementation of
this type of procedure in vivo is accomplished in very tight places where
the room to maneuver is very small and

4) Another way that would improve the success rate of the procedure is the

possibility of the application of in vivo sizing of the hosting bone. This
would lead to the perfect fit between the hosting bones, placing the
implant in perfect support conditions (contact with the cortical bone). 5) The design of the implant in this project was based only on the CT scans

of only one sheep tibial bone. Size averaging of a large population of

sheep's, would decrease the size difference between the implant and host

bone, consequently increasing the chance for success of the biodegradable
implants.
