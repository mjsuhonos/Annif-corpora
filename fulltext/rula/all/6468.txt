SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION WITH TRADE CREDIT AND PRICE DISCOUNT WITH/WITHOUT ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS Doctor of Philosophy in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (2017) Salem Mousa Salem Aljazzar Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada

Abstract

For a supply chain coordination to be effective and profitable, it requires a working mechanism among its members to entice some players to join a partnership. Two of the well-known trade credits that are widely used by businesses are the permissible delay in payments and price discounts. This thesis presents models for coordinating supply chains with both trade credits. The first model investigates the effect of utilizing delay in payments in a two-level (manufacturer-retailer) supply chain. It modifies and analyzes three known models of different production and shipping policies to account for delays in payments; it then compares them and highlights the production policy that performed the best with the total system cost being the performance measure. The second model analyzes the coordination of a three-level (suppliermanufacturer-retailer) supply chain with the delay in payments. It analyzes nine iii

different scenarios of permissible delay among the three players. A simulation study was performed and a thorough analysis of the results was used to identify the limitations of all scenarios and to draw some managerial insights and findings. The third model investigates the effect of coupling permissible delay in payments and price discounts for coordinating a three-level. The analysis considers nine different cases of delay-in-payments along with eight cases of price discounts among the three players in the supply chain, totaling seventy-two cases. The numerical examples and the sensitivity analyses show that the coupling of delayin-payments and price discounts maximizes the supply chain profit more than when using a single mechanism at a time. The fourth model investigates a two-level supply chain by studying the effects of various scenarios for delay-in-payments when including some environmental costs such as fuel and emissions from manufacturing and transportation. The objective of the model is to optimize the environmental and the economic performance of the supply chain. The results show that delay-in-payments improves the economic and the environmental performance of a supply chain.

1.1 Supply Chain Management
The supply chain is a topic that has been the center of attention for researchers from academia and industry for some time. Many studies have been published on this subject to enhance our knowledge on how supply chain management tools can increase customer satisfaction and profitability. It helps companies in improving their competitiveness in markets. The effective and efficient coordination among the members of a supply chain is necessary for its success. Some researchers claim that coordinating a supply chain may reduce its cost by 25% - 30% (Lee, Padmanabhan, & Wang, 1997; Sahin & Robinson, 2002). The Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP) defines supply chain management as: "The planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing and procurement, conversion and all logistics management activities. Importantly, it also includes coordination and collaboration with channel partners, which can be suppliers, intermediaries, third-party service providers and customers" (CSCMP, 2013). Therefore, a supply chain is a system that represents the movement of services or products from the furthest tier supplier to the end customer in an efficient and effective manner. The objective of supply chain management is to increase the value to customers (end users) and to maximize the total profit of the supply chain. Supply chain management tools are applied in different departments of an organization, such as purchasing, operations, and logistics. The process of transferring raw materials into products and delivering them to customers consists of many stages, which include 2

procurement, production and distribution (Thomas & Griffin, 1996). Each stage of the supply chain involves several firms of different locations.

1.2 Decision making
Organizational decisions are operational (daily), tactical (medium-range), and strategic (long-range). Organizations delegate decisions differently. Decisionmaking can either be centralized or de-centralized. Some organizations combine both. Next, these decisions are described with their advantages and disadvantages briefly discussed.

1.2.1 Decentralized Decision Making
A decentralized decision involves several decisions (makers from the

organizations forming a supply chain) who prioritize the goals of their own organizations. However, this may result in conflicts between partnering organizations. Conflicts may affect the performance of a supply chain; however, it has some benefits: "First: It encourages motivation and creativity. Secondly, it allows many minds to work simultaneously on the same problem. Finally, it accommodates flexibility and individualization" (Malone, 2004).

1.2.2 Centralized Decision Making
Centralized decision-making is the most commonly used policy in the literature (Glock, 2012; Jaber & Zolfaghari, 2008) with the objective of maximizing (minimizing) supply chain profits (costs). It assumes that there is a single

3

decision-maker (a group working together) to manage the flow of goods, information, and services in a supply chain. One of the advantages of centralized decision-making is that employees generally have some idea of what their organization expects from them. In addition, applying this strategy gives top management the ability to closely monitor and control the operations in their organization. It is costly to some of the players because they have to shift their inventory policies to facilitate coordination. To make coordination work, the player with the most savings, usually a vendor or a supplier, would compensate the losing player by offering it a trade credit option, such as quantity discounts, permissible delay in payments, price discount, volume discount, etc. Moreover, to further entice players in a supply chain to coordinate, profit sharing (or sharing of savings) scenarios could be considered. This research will consider a centralized decision-making model according to the literature (Glock, 2012; Jaber & Zolfaghari, 2008).

1.3 Supply Chain coordination
Jaber and Osman (2006) defined the coordination of supply chain as "a joint decision policy achieved by a supplier(s) and a retailer(s) characterized by an agreement on the order quantity and the trade credit scenario (e.g. quantity discounts, delay in payments)". Researchers in the area of supply chain management highlighted the many benefits of coordination that help the players in a supply chain maximize (minimize) their total profits (costs). They noted that coordinating a supply chain reduces risks that might arise from disruptions, 4

eases access to resources, and provides a competitive advantage (Haghighat, 2008).

1.4 Coordination mechanisms
Coordination mechanisms in supply chains have been defined by (Haghighat, 2008) as "...the tools by which, every member of the supply chain can achieve more benefits". Sahin and Robinson (2002) classified coordination mechanisms into price, nonprice, buy-back and returns policies. Moreover, Fugate, Sahin and Mentzer (2006) adopted Sahin and Robinson's (2002) classification and classified the coordination into price, non-price and flow coordination, shown in Figure 1.1.

The following is a brief description of the elements of the coordination mechanisms used in the literature as per the classification provided in Figure 1.1.

1.4.1 Price Coordination:
Price/Quantity Discount: One of the useful tools that suppliers use to entice buyers to order larger quantities is to offer them discounts associated with the quantities purchased. As the quantity ordered increases the discount increases. There are two types of quantity - discount in the literature, which are all-unit discount and incremental discount. In all-unit discount, higher orders are subjected to more discounts. The incremental discount applies a discount bracket to a specified range of quantities. This makes the price like a descending staircase. There are several factors that affect the amount of discount such as annual order volume, annual number of orders, and when the demand is dependent on the price. Permissible delay in payment: The permissible delay in payment is one of the coordination mechanisms that have been used in the business world. It suggests that a supplier gives its customers some time to settle an outstanding balance or the payment. A delay period is the elapsed time between receiving a shipment and paying for it at no additional charges. No interest is usually charged. If a customer delays a payment beyond its due date, then an interest is charged on the owing balance over the extended period. This is part of the agreement between the parties.

6

Consignment Stock Agreement Consignment Stock Agreement is one of the useful coordination mechanisms. A vendor agrees with a buyer to store items at its facility. The buyer sells these items and pays the supplier once withdrawn from inventory. Both players benefit: the vendor saves on storage costs and frees space for other products, while the buyer frees the capital tied up in inventory.

1.4.2 Non-Price Coordination:
Quantity Flexibility (QF): QF is a method for coordinating information and material flow in supply chains. The most important advantage of using QF is that allows "buyers to obtain a different quantity than the previous estimate" (Tayur, Ganeshan, & Magazine, 1999). Allocation Rules: Product allocation rules used by suppliers allocate their insufficient capacity among their customers (Fugate et al., 2006). Promotional Allowances/ Cooperative Advertising: The promotional allowance is a reduction in the price of products that is offered by a player in the supply chain to its customer in support of supplier's products.

Exclusive Dealings: When suppliers give their customers an exclusive deal, they retain the customers' loyalty toward future purchases.

7

Exclusive Territories: In this type of coordination, a supplier chooses a customer as the exclusive representative of its products in a territory, region or country.

1.4.3 Flow Coordination
Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI): It is a coordination mechanism where the vendor is responsible for managing the buyer's inventory. VMI is usually coupled with consignment stock. Quick Response (QR): QR speeds communication (e.g. placing orders, purchasing requests) between suppliers and retailers by using computerized equipment such as barcodes and electronic data interchange (EDI). This coordination mechanism reduces the order response time, improves shipment and inventory accuracy, reduces operating expenses, and avoids stock out situations in supply chain. Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR): CPFR is a collaboration mechanism where players in a supply chain share their information from production and delivery of raw materials to production and delivery of final goods to end customers. This collaboration smooths the flow of goods and services, forecasts, and delivery schedules. Efficient Consumer Response (ECR): This coordination mechanism reduces the order response time, improves shipment and inventory accuracy, reduces operating expenses, and avoids stock out situations in a supply chain.

8

Postponement: Postponement is one of the coordination mechanisms in which manufacturers delay further investment or the production of a product (usually in the production final stages) until they have received final commitment from customers.

Another way to coordinate a supply chain system is through the Joint Economic Lot Size (JELS), which is to determine the order, production and shipment quantities between the players in a supply chain.

1.5 Supply chain and the environment
Supply chain management is the process of managing and planning resources from a raw material until it reaches to the end user. It includes purchasing, producing and all logistics activities. Most of the Green House Gases (GHG) emissions that are generated by a supply chain come mainly from production and transportation activities. In today's globalized economy, the market demand is increasing and so are the environmental implications (Beamon, 1999a). There is enough evidence that increased consumption increases GHG emissions and waste. Today, the area of analyzing the effects of the supply chain activities on the environment is an attractive topic for researchers.

2.1 Introduction
This thesis deals with coordination in a supply chain where the decision-making process is centralized. It adopts the JELS approach, i.e., determining the size and the number of shipments that minimizes the total supply chain cost. They are listed and classified by keywords in Table 2.1. The table also shows how the models in this thesis differ from the literature. The keywords are the number of levels in a supply chain (supplier, vendor or manufacturer, and buyer), and the trade credit mechanism used (e.g., delay in payments, quantity discounts). The literature is limited to supply chains of three levels (supplier-vendor-buyer). To the author's knowledge, the only work available in the literature that investigated the JELS in a four-level supply chain is the work of Jaber and Goyal (2009). In this thesis, a vendor is not a manufacturer, but a distributor. A manufacturer is the one who fabricates raw materials received from the supplier into products. A brief literature review of the types of trade credit applied to supply chain modeling is provided next.

2.2 Permissible delay in payment
The inventory literature assumes that a buyer (vendor or supplier) pays for its purchased goods upon delivery, an uncommon business practice. Businesses today give customers time (a permissible delay period) to settle what they owe them at no cost. Payments not received on time are subject to interest charges. Delay in payments has benefits. The vendor can move more items to the side of the buyer saving on storage costs. The buyer can free the capital tied up in inventory. Goyal (1985) developed a two-level supply chain model (vendor-buyer) with delay in payments. He assumed that the length is determined by the vendor and considered cases when the delay in payment is less or longer than the buyer's cycle time. Jamal, Sarker and Wang (2000) developed a model for a retailer (buyer) in a two-level supply chain system (supplier-buyer) with a deteriorating item inventory to coordinate the retailer's optimal cycle and payment time. In their model, the wholesaler (supplier) allows the retailer a certain permissible delay in payment with no interest charges, and if the retailer goes beyond this period, an interest amount is charged based on the agreement. They modeled it as a cost minimization problem with two decision variables, which are the length of the delay period and the length of the inventory cycle. Jamal et al. (2000) assumed no shortages and an interest-free delay period by the supplier. Due to the loss from deteriorating in inventory, they assumed that the inventory level varies with time.

13

Jaber and Osman (2006) presented a mathematical model for coordinating a twolevel supply chain (supplier-retailer) when the length of the permissible delay in payment is a joint decision variable for the buyer and the seller. They were the first to make such an assumption. In addition, they considered the holding cost in their calculations to consist of two components: holding cost and storage cost, which is more realistic than what has been assumed in the literature. Moreover, their point of view was that coordination involves the collaboration of the players in the supply chain, so they proposed a profit sharing scenario of the savings generated by the coordination. They showed that besides a delay in payment some discount could be offered either forward (from supplier to the buyer) or backward (from buyer to supplier). Sarmah, Acharya and Goyal (2007) proposed a coordination mechanism in a two-level supply chain system (manufacturer ­ buyer). The objective of their coordination is to divide the surplus generated from the coordination equally between the players after satisfying each player's profit target by using a delay in payments mechanism. They used the credit period as an incentive to coordinate the activities for the two members of the supply chain for two cases. The first case is when players do have target profit and the second case when the two players do not have targeted profit. Sarmah et al. (2007) assumed in their paper that shortages are not allowed and replenishment is instantaneous. They solved a numerical example to illustrate and demonstrate the difference between the two cases with the credit option. In addition, they included a comparison between two incentive mechanisms (credit and discount policy). 14

2.3 Price discount
Price discount is a coordination mechanism that has been introduced in the literatures as an enticement for customers to order in larger quantities than their Economic Order Quantity (EOQ). Gupta and Goyal (1989) proposed a coordination for a two-level supply chain system (vendor ­ buyer) through implementing a price-quantity discount mechanism. They made the following assumptions: the demand at the buyer's end is deterministic, shortages are not allowed, and the buyer's and vendor's inventory policies are based on a simple EOQ inventory model. Chen, Federgruen and Zehng (2001) suggested a coordination mechanism for the distribution system in a centralized two-level supply chain system (supplier ­ multiple retailers). Their objective was to identify an optimal strategy that will maximize the total supply chain system's profit. They assumed that the supplier distributes a single product and the holding cost is of two components, physical (variable) and capital (fixed). Moreover, they assumed that the retailers pay the supplier upon the arrival of their orders and showed that the proposed optimal strategy can have the same effect in a decentralized system by considering a nontraditional price discount. In addition, they showed that offering a nontraditional price discount also works when multiple non-identical retailers are considered. Klastorin, Moinzadeh and Son (2002) investigated a coordination of a two-level supply chain system (supplier ­ multiple retailers). Their proposed coordination

15

model is where the manufacturer offers a price discount to retailers when the retailers coordinate their order based on the manufacturer's order cycle. Klastorin et al. (2002) assured that their proposed policy enhances and improves the efficiency of the supply chain. Moreover, they found a simple method to identify the optimal price discount for the manufacturer in a decentralized supply chain. Jaber, Osman and Guiffrida (2006) used a price discount coordination mechanism to maximize the profit of a three-level supply chain system (suppliermanufacturer-retailer), where the supplier offers a discounted price to the vendor and the vendor to the buyer whose demand is price discount dependent, where the price discounts offered, order quantities, and numbers of shipments are decision variables. In addition, they enhanced and sustained coordination by proposing two profit-sharing scenarios. The first scenario, semi-liberal, which is maximizing the total chain profit for a new market, guarantees that the profit of each player should be higher with coordination than without. However, it does not guarantee an identical return on investment per dollar invested for all players. In addition, their second scenario was a strict profit sharing scenario that suggested each player in the supply chain gets an equal return on each dollar invested. Jaber et al. (2006) assumed in their paper a single product case, shortages are not allowed, lead time is zero, perfect quality items, and an infinite planning horizon. In addition, they assumed that the demand of the retailer is price dependent and that the cost parameters are fixed and will not vary over time. 16

Yue, Austin, Wang and Huang (2006) investigated the coordination of a two-level (manufacturer ­ multiple retailers) cooperative advertisement supply chain. In their model, the manufacturer offers a price discount to the retailers to increase local advertisement. Moreover, Yue et al. (2006) found an adequate condition for a price discount to ensure an increase in manufacturer's profit and therefore the optimal national brand investment and the local advertisement for a manufacturer-retailer system. They assumed that the manufacturer gives the retailer a price discount that varies over time; however, they did not treat it as a decision variable. The literature shows that price discount received little attention in the literature.

2.4 Price dependent demand
As many authors usually based their studies on scenarios practiced by businesses, price-dependent demand is one of those assumptions that have been adopted in the literature. Jaber et al. (2006), surveyed above, used the price discounts coordination mechanism to maximize the profit of a three-level supply chain system (supplier-manufacturer-retailer). They assumed that the demand of the retailer is a price-discount dependent demand, and it is a decision variable. Chen, Chen, Chiu, Choi and Sethi (2010) studied a coordination in a two-level supply chain system (supplier-retailer), where the supplier provides the retailer with a single product whose demand is price-dependent. They included a scenario where the supplier reserves production capacity in advance for the

17

retailer. In addition, in their paper, they included restriction: after the supplier updates the demand during the lead-time, the retailer cannot place an order larger than what the supplier has reserved. Moreover, Chen et al. (2010) developed a two-stage optimization problem, with the first stage is when the supplier determines the reserved capacity. The second stage is when the retailer decides how the order quantity and the selling price after analyzing the demand information. Moreover, (H. Chen et al., 2010) suggested that coordination of a supply chain can be achieved by providing a three-parameter risk and profit sharing model. To the author's knowledge, Jaber et al. (2006) is the only work in the literature that assumes a price-discount dependent demand, where price discounts are offered by an upstream player to a downstream one, and by the retailer to customers.

2.5 Supply chain and the environment
Reducing the cost of a supply chain in a non-coordinated environment and optimizing it in a coordinated environment is desirable. Various coordination mechanisms for supply chains of different structures and assumptions presented in the literature have been shown to reduce costs and improve profitability (Bushuev, Guiffrida, Jaber, & Khan, 2015; Glock, 2012; Glock, Grosse, & Ries, 2014; Mohamad Y. Jaber & Zolfaghari, 2008; Li & Wang, 2007; Sahin & Robinson, 2002). Some lag in payments after receiving a shipment is

18

understandable since accounts receivables are usually slower to collect and there is not always a surplus of cash. This is becoming increasingly important to many firms who are investing in their processes to become environmentally sustainable. Although there has been some increasing interest by researchers to incorporate environmental factors into supply chain modeling due to their importance (Bonney & Jaber, 2011 ; see Andriolo et al.(2014) and Bushuev et al. (2015) for a review of the literature), there are no papers that investigated if a delay-in-payments (trade credit) would enhance or deteriorate the performance of a supply chain when environmental issues are considered. In this regard, this thesis investigates the effects of delay-in-payments in a two-level supply chain while taking into account the emissions costs from manufacturing and transportation, and fuel cost and truck capacity, and analyzes their combined effects on inventory policies in a manufacturer-buyer supply chain. The economic order quantity (EOQ) model (Harris, 1913) has been used as a vehicle to demonstrate the combined effects of the above parameters on lot sizing policies and total costs. Next, the importance of environmental issues in supply chain management (SCM), the purpose of offering delay in payments, and a review of the papers that investigated coordination in supply chains with environmental performance are briefly discussed. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are generated from different sources, of which manufacturing and transport activities are primary sources, and are a welldiscussed topic in the literature. Many authors have analyzed the volume of transport emissions under various modes of transportation and unanimously 19

suggested to reduce it using various methods (e.g., Bazan et al., 2015; Cadarso et al., 2010; Cristea et al., 2013; Dalsøren et al., 2009; Fuglestvedt et al., 2010; Gilbert and Bows, 2012; Gurtu et al., 2015; Howitt et al., 2011). Fossil fuel is not only the cause of transport emissions, (Polatoglu & Sahin, 2000) but is also a major component of the transportation cost. However, it has traditionally been included in the order cost because of the assumption that an increase in oil prices is in line with the inflation. Fuel cost is important to be considered separately because it increases at a rate much higher than the inflation rate and It accounts for about 35% of the total truck transport cost (Gurtu et al., 2015). Similarly, the fuel cost in shipping is about 30% (Notteboom & Vernimmen, 2009). Separating it from the order cost will show its influence on the order costs as well as on the lot size. A large body of the literature has addressed the alarming trends of increases in emissions at disproportionate rates (e.g., Gurtu et al., 2016; Paul et al., 2009; Peters et al., 2007; Schipper et al., 2001). These studies have suggested various mechanisms for reducing it by introducing a carbon tax and/or a cap-and-trade scheme, which have been investigated in a few studies that deal with a two-level supply chain (Bazan et al., 2015; Jaber, Glock, & El Saadany, 2013).

20

2.6 Research gaps and objectives:
The main purpose of research is to develop and investigate real life scenarios that would be helpful for academicians and practitioners and that have not been addressed in the literature. The following research gaps were identified after surveying the JELS literature:  No study investigated the effects of permissible delay in payments in coordinating a two-level (manufacturer-retailer) supply chain, when the length of a delay in payment is treated as a decision variable, for three different production policies.  No study investigated the effects of delay in payments in coordinating a three-level (supplier-manufacturer-retailer) supply chain, where the permissible delay in payments is offered by the upstream player to the downstream one.  No study investigated and analyzed the effectiveness of integrating two coordination mechanisms, delay in payments and price discounts, in coordinating a three-level supply chain.  No study investigated how offering a trade credit, particularly delay in payments, improves the environmental performance of a supply chain. The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 3 presents a coordination of a two-level (manufacturer-retailer) supply chain with the delay in payments.

CHAPTER 3 : Coordination of a two-level supply chain (manufacturer-retailer) with permissible delay in payments

23

3.1 Introduction
The success of a supply chain can be measured by its efficacy and profitability. It can be achieved through the cooperation between all of its players. A working mechanism is required to motivate the players to cooperate and increase the profitability of the supply chain. One of the common mechanisms in practice is permissible delay in payments. It allows a customer some time to settle its balance at no charge (interest-free-period). However, if the customer wishes to prolong the permissible delay period beyond what initially agreed upon, then an interest is charged on the owing balance. This chapter presents an investigation of coordinating a two-level supply chain (manufacturer-retailer) with delay in payments being a decision variable. The chapter revisits three well-known production policies, which are those of Goyal (1988), Hill (1997) and Jaber, Bonney and Guiffrida (2010), and modifies them. The objective of this chapter is to determine which production policy provides the minimal total cost when permissible delay in payments is considered. The remainder of chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.2 introduces the assumptions and notations. Section 3.3 provides the mathematical models of the modified versions of the production policies considered in this chapter. Section 3.4 illustrates the behavior of the models and compares them using numerical examples. Section 3.5 presents a sensitivity analysis to show the limitations of the presented models. Finally, a conclusion and a discussion are provided in section 3.6.

24

3.2 Assumptions and notations
This chapter considers the following assumptions       A single product is assumed. Shipment lots are equal. Demand is deterministic and constant over time. Shortages are not allowed. The production rate of the manufacturer is larger than the demand rate. The holding cost consists of two parts: financial and physical (storage) holding costs.  The manufacturer allows the retailer for an interest-free period to settle its outstanding payment.  Interest will be charged if the retailer settles its outstanding payment beyond the permissible period.  The retailer is not allowed to have more than one out-standing payment and pays the balance to the manufacturer at  and in a single payment. The following notations have been used to develop the mathematical models of this chapter:

3.3 Mathematical modeling
This section summarizes the mathematical models of Goyal (1988) (as shown in Model 1), Hill (1997) (as shown in Model 2) and Jaber et al. (2010) (as shown in Model 3).

26

3.3.1 Goyal (1988) with a permissible delay in payments
Goyal (1988) extended the work of Banerjee (1986a) and relaxed the finite assumptions for lot-for-lot (LFL) shipments. He considered a situation where the vendor (manufacturer) produces an integer multiple () of the retailer's order quantity ( ). The inventory behavior of Goyal (1988) is illustrated in Figure 3.1,where the manufacturer is at the upper level and the retailer at the bottom level.

Figure 3.1: Inventory behavior of the manufacturer as suggested by Goyal (1988).

For this chapter, the work of Goyal (1988) was modified by accounting for delays in payment as a coordination mechanism and for a financial holding cost. As

27

suggested in Jaber and Osman (2006), the length of the permissible delay in payments, , and the time to settle the account, , are decision variables, whose values are jointly determined along with the number of shipment n and the size of shipment Q. As per Jaber and Osman (2006), there are three possible cases considered: Case I: 0   =    , Case II: 0       , and Case III: 0      .

Case I: 0   =    In this case, the manufacturer allows the retailer  period of time to settle its outstanding payments, and the retailer's settlement period  is equal to . Accordingly, the manufacturer's total annual cost, which includes setup, production and financial holding costs, is written as follows, where  is replaced by :
1,  =

   +   +   + (  +  - 1)  +   + ( -  )    2  -   (-)

(3.1)

In this case, where  =  the term   (-) reduces to  . When P approaches infinity (instantaneous replenishment), Eq. (3.1) reduces to Eq. (4) in Jaber and Osman (2006). The assumption is made that the retailer invests  , which is owed to the manufacturer, in a risk-free investment. Accordingly, the retailer's total annual cost, which includes order, purchasing, physical holding costs and interest earnings, is as follows:

28

1, 

( - )2    = +   +  +  +  (1 -    )  2  2

(3.2)

shown to be convex in  and  (see e.g. Appendix in Jaber and Osman, 2006). Therefore, the proof of convexity for each model  were not provided. The solution for Eq. (3.3) is, after setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving for  , given as:  2 (  +  ) +  ()2 =   +  + ( +  ) (   +  - 1)

note that  is an integer and the computed value is either n or n. Further analysis is conducted to understand the behavior of Eq. (3.3), as follows. The second derivative of Eq. (3.3) with respect to  is positive (i.e.: 1, =

.

Case II: 0   <    In this case, the retailer settles its owed balance with the manufacturer at a time after the delay in payment but before the end of its cycle and before receiving the next shipment. Subsequently, the retailer's annual cost is:
1,  =

( - )2    +   +  +  +  ( (-) -    )  2  2

(3.5)

The solution for Eq. (3.6) is the same as for Eq. (3.3); i.e., 1, = 1, . The number of shipments n is the same as that for Eq. (3.3); subsequently,  1, =  1, . The
1, second derivative of Eq. (3.6) with respect to Q is positive, i.e.,  =    2

Case III: 0       30

This case considers a situation when the retailer settles its balance after the first cycle. Accordingly, the retailer's annual total cost is written as:
1,  =

   +   +  +  ( (-) -    )  2

(3.7)

1,  for this case is the same as that for Case I after replacing  with  in the

term   . Subsequently, the annual total cost of this supply chain can be written as follows:
1,  = ( +  )

  +   + ( +  ) + (  +  - 1)  +    2   -     2

(3.8)

+ ( -  )   + 

The solution for Eq. (3.8) is, after setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving for Q, given as:  2 (  +  ) =   + ( +  ) (   +  - 1)

31

3.3.2 Hill (1997) with a permissible delay in payment
Hill (1997) proposed a different production policy than that of Goyal (1988) by allowing shipments to be delivered to the retailer during the production segment of the manufacturer's cycle, with the first shipment reducing the manufacturer's inventory level to zero. The inventory behavior of Hill's model is illustrated in Figure 3.2.

Similar to Goyal (1988), the model of Hill (1997) is modified to account for the three cases of delay in payment discussed above and a financial holding cost. 32

Case I: 0   =    This case considers that the retailer's period  to settle its payment is equal to the permissible period offered by the manufacturer . Consequently, the manufacturer's annual total cost can be written as follows where  is replaced by :    +    +   + [2 + (1 - )  - 1]  +   + ( -  )   2   -   (-)
(3.10)

2,  =

(3.12)

For the same values of the input parameters and fixed values of the decision variables  and , the order quantity for case I of Model 1 is larger than that of Model 2 for the same case, 1,   2,   3, when n  1, since the denominator in 1,I is larger than the denominator in  2,I which is larger than the denominator

Case II: 0   <   
2,II 1,II The retailer's annual total cost  is the same as  for Case II. In addition, 2,II  for this case is the same as that for Case I but after replacing t in the term

The solution for Eq. (3.13) is the same as for Eq. (3.11); i.e.,  2,I =  2,II . The number of shipments  is the same as that for Eq. (3.11); as well, the manufacturer's lot size is the same for Case I; i.e.,  2,I =  2,II . The value of  is the same as for Case II of model 1:  =  [

(3.15)

The number of shipments  is the same as that for Eq. (3.9) and  2,  (

III of Model 1 can be made here, where  =  and  = 0.

3.3.3 Jaber et al. (2010) with a permissible delay in payment
The last production policy that is investigated in this chapter is that of Jaber et al. (2010) who assumed that the manufacturer starts producing when its inventory reaches zero. Similar to Hill (1997), they assumed that the manufacturer ships to the buyer while production is running. The only difference between the two policies is that the manufacturer's inventory does not reach zero after sending the first shipment. The inventory behavior of this policy is illustrated in Figure 3.3.

Figure 3.3: Inventory behavior of the manufacturer as suggested by Jaber et al. (2010).

Note that Jaber et al. (2010) considered learning and forgetting in production, whereas this chapter rests this assumption. Similar to the earlier two models, the model of Jaber et al. (2010) is modified to account for the three cases of delay in payment discussed above and a financial holding costs. Case I: 0   =    This case assumes that the retailer settles its payments with the manufacturer at time , where  is equal to the permissible period offered by the manufacturer . Therefore, the annual total cost for the manufacturer can be written as follows, where  is replaced by : 37

(3.16)

3,I 1,I In this case, the retailer's annual cost,  , is the same as  in Case I for model 3,I 3,I one. Therefore, the annual total cost of the system,  =  + . (3.2), can be

written as follows:

3,I  = ( +  )

 3, =

(3.18)

For the same values of the input parameters and fixed values of the decision variables  and  = , the order quantity for Case I of Model 1 is larger than that of Model 2, which is larger than that of Model 3 for the same case; i.e.,  3, >  2, > 1, . The value of  for Model 3 and Case I is the same for Model 2 and Case

Case II: 0   <   
3,II 1, The annual total cost for the retailer  is equal to  in Case II. Moreover, 3,II  for this case is the same as Eq. (3.16) after replacing  with  in the term

3,II 3,II  =  + . (3.5), can be written as:

The solution for Eq. (3.19) is the same as for Eq. (3.17); i.e.,  3,I =  3,II , except for replacing  with  in the numerator. The number of shipments () and the manufacturer's lot size are the same as for Case I of Model 3, where  =  [
 - +

3.4 Numerical example
In this section, numerical examples are provided to compare the models that were modified in Section 3.3, which are Goyal (1988), Hill (1997), and Jaber et al. (2010), to account for the delay in payments as a coordination mechanism with its length and the time to settle the balance with the manufacturer, along with the number of shipments and the shipment size, as decision variables. The purpose of the numerical examples is to identify which of the production policies provide the minimum total cost. The values of the parameters used in numerical examples were adopted from Jaber and Osman (2006), who assumed a supplier (rather than a manufacturer) where the inventory replenishment rate is

41

instantaneous. The values of the production rate are greater than the demand rate of the retailer; this avoids shortages. The numerical examples (567 examples) were solved using Matlab software. Table 3.2 lists the values of the input parameters for the base example. Similar to Jaber and Osman (2006),  +  = 16 and  +  = 12. Note that the values of , ,  ,  ,  ,  ,    were divided by 365 to be converted to days before using them in the calculations. The results of the numerical example for the three Models, run over the three Cases, are summarized in Table 3.3. The Matlab software was used to find the minimum total cost with ,  ,  and  as decision variables.

The result showed that the model of Hill (1997) performed the best of the three models for the three cases by about 16%, with Goyal (1988) and Jaber et al. (2010) being second and third respectively, where the costs of the last two models were very close. The results also showed that Case III is the best of the three cases where  = 3,   = 989 and   = 3.01 and the cost is $80.31/day. In addition, the analysis can be made that, to make coordination possible, the retailer accepts a non-interest-free-period of delay in payments; i.e.,  = 0 and  > 0.

3.5 Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis is performed to test how changing the values of some of the input parameters affects the three models. The results of the analysis show which model is better/worse, and the required conditions for these variations. The first study was performed to test the effect of varying the demand over the production rates on the total cost. Varying the ratio of the demand rate to the production rate, /, as shown in Figure 3.4, reveals that the three models have their lowest costs when / is small, 0.1, and that the cost of Goyal's model increases as / increases for Cases I, II and III. The total costs of Hill (1997) and Jaber et al. (2010) are shown to have a concave behavior for increasing values of / . The model of Jaber et al. (2010) performed the worst for / < 0.4 (Case I) and / < 0.35 (Cases II and III); however, it performed better than that of Goyal when the earlier / values are exceeded. Figure 3.4 also shows 43

that the models of Goyal (1988) and Hill (1997) performed very close for very low values of /  0.1, while Jaber et al. (2010) and Hill (1997) performed the same for high values of /  0.9.

The second study was implemented to investigate the effect on the total cost that can be found by varying the retailer's financial holding cost over the manufacturer's financial holding cost. As shown in Figure 3.5, varying the ratio of the retailer's financial holding cost to the manufacturer's financial holding cost results in all models having their lowest costs when  / is small,  0.25. 44

The model proposed by Jaber et al. (2010) performed the worst for Cases I and III; however, it performed better than the model of Goyal (1988) for Case II when  / > 1.0. In Case III, the retailer settles its outstanding payments in a single payment where its inventory level will be zero. Accordingly, the total costs of all models behave the same (constant behaviour) as shown in Figure 3.5. This figure also shows that the total cost of Hill (1997) performed the best amongst all three models in Cases I, II and III.

The third study was performed to study the effect of varying the retailer's ordering cost ( ) over the manufacturer's setup costs ( ) on the total cost of the system. As shown in Figure 3.6, varying this ratio according to  / results in the three models having their lowest costs when  / is small, 0.25, with the cost increasing as the  / increases for Cases I, II and III. Figure 3.6 also shows that the models of Goyal (1988) and Jaber et al. (2010) performed very close for low values of  / ,0.25, while Goyal (1988) and Hill (1997) performed the same for high values of  / ,2.0, in Cases II and III.

3.6 Conclusion
This chapter extends the work of Jaber and Osman (2006) by assuming that the vendor is not a supplier (instantaneous replenishment) but a manufacturer for a final product (that produces at a finite replenishment rate), which is shipped to the retailer in several batches. The chapter investigates and compares three different production policies for the manufacturer to determine which one works better when a permissible delay in payments is adopted as a coordination mechanism. Each production policy, Goyal (1988), Hill (1997) and Jaber et al. (2010), was tested for three different cases relating to the length of the delay in payments and the time to settle the balance with the manufacturer. In the first case, the retailer settles its balance in a single payment by the end of the interestfree delay period and before receiving the next shipment. In the second case, the retailer settles its payment after the interest-free period and before receiving the next shipment. In Case III, the retailer settles its balance after receiving the next shipment, which is an interest-bearing period. In the three models and for the three cases, the manufacturer and the retailer treat delay in payments as a coordination mechanism and jointly decide on the length of the interest-free and interest-bearing delay periods. Numerical examples were solved to compare between the three production policies under three different cases of delay in payments mentioned above. The results showed that in Cases I and II, it is better for the manufacturer to adopt the production policy of Hill (1997) as it provides the least total cost for the

47

manufacturer and the system. However, for the retailer, the minimum total cost is achieved when the manufacturer adopts the policy of Goyal (1988) for Cases I and II. For Case III, the best result for the manufacturer is obtained when it works under the policy of Jaber et al. (2010). On the other hand, the best outcome for both the retailer and the system is shown when the manufacturer follows the production policy of Hill (1997). A sensitivity analysis was performed to analyze the effect of changing the values of some input parameters on the behavior of the total cost of the three developed models. The first analysis was implemented to test the effect of varying the demand over the production rates. The results concluded that the production policy of Hill (1997) provided the least total cost of the system in all cases. As well, the production policy of Hill (1997) showed more flexibility, when compared to the others, on incorporating the permissible delay in payments. The second study was applied to test the effect of varying the ratio of the retailer's financial holding costs over the manufacturer's financial holding costs. The results of this study, in all cases, shows that the production policy of Hill (1997) is also the best as it gives the least total system cost. As the retailer settles its payment after receiving the next shipment in Case III, the results show that the total cost of the system is insensitive to the retailer's financial and storage holding costs in all models in this case. The last test was performed to investigate the effect of varying the ordering cost of the retailer over the setup cost of the manufacturer on the total cost of the system. The results also show that the production policy

48

of Hill (1997) was the best among the others by providing the least total system cost in all cases. From the results, this chapter concludes that the production policy of Hill (1997) is the best among the others to be followed by a manufacturer in conjunction with a permissible delay in payments (as a decision variable) in a two-level supply chain system, from a total-cost-minimization perspective. There are a couple of reasons for this conclusion. First, the production policy of Hill (1997) gave the least total cost for the supply chain system in all cases compared to Goyal (1988) and Jaber et al. (2010). Furthermore, it provided a range of flexibility when varying the ratio of the demand over the production as well as the ratio of the retailer's financial over the manufacturer's financial costs. Note that the assumptions of the numerical examples are the common assumptions in most of the literature, where the holding cost of the retailer is larger than the manufacturer's holding cost, and that the manufacturer's setup cost is larger than the retailer's order cost. There are different possible extensions for the models presented in this chapter. The first extension is to assume a fixed period of the permissible delay in payments in order to compare between the three policies. In addition, one can assume that the demand and the production rates are stochastic rather than deterministic. Finally, this chapter could be extended by assuming a three-level supply chain system (supplier-manufacturer-buyer) instead of two-level.

CHAPTER 4 : Coordination of a three-level (supplier-manufacturer-retailer) with permissible delay in payments

50

4.1 Introduction
Supply chain management is considered one of the most useful management practices for industries to increase their sustainability and competitiveness. In today's globalized economy, supply chain sustainability is key to ensuring business continuity and managing operational costs (Gold, Seuring, & Beske, 2010). With the growing focus on sustainable supply chain management, firms realize that inventories across the entire supply chain can be more efficiently managed through greater cooperation and better coordination. The collaborative paradigm in supply chain management is a crucial source of competitive advantage, as it can increase the impact and efficiency of the supply chain. As collaboration increases among supply chain players, the total costs reduce by up to 30% (Lee et al., 1997; Sahin & Robinson, 2002).

Coordination in supply chain management is based on centralized and decentralized decision making. The objective of supply chain coordination is to minimize the total supply chain cost. In a decentralized supply chain, each player tries to maximize its own performance, resulting in an inefficient supply chain. In centralized decision making, coordination allows supply chain players to work closely to streamline their decision making, with the objective being to maximize the entire supply chain performance. Inefficiencies reduce throughout the entire supply chain, with better matching of supply and demand. As a result, costs reduce and sales increase, leading to increased supply chain profitability.

51

Permissible delay in payments, a trade-credit option, facilitates coordination by enticing the buyer (retailer) to order in larger lots than its Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), whereby the buyer is allowed by the vendor (manufacturer) to settle its balance by a certain time at no additional charges (interest-free period). For example, a Walmart supplier reduced its capital expenditure by 1.2% by offering Wal-Mart a one-month delay in payment (Murfin & Njoroge, 2015). In addition, the buyer will benefit from the permissible delay by investing its owed balance in a risk-free investment during the interest-free period. However, interest charges will be applied to the buyer if the settlement occurs after the permissible period. However, the retailer accrues interest by investing cash from sales over the delay period. The benefits for the vendor when offering a permissible period are an increase in sales and savings on storage costs by moving some of the inventory to the buyer's side.

The main contribution of this chapter is that it investigates the coordination of a three-level (supplier-manufacturer-retailer) supply chain, using the

permissible delay in payments as a decision variable. Although in real life practices, the length of the permissible delay in payments is not considered as a decision variable, treating it as such will shed light on the optimal permissible period that would minimize the total cost of the supply chain. Coordinating a three-level supply chain with the permissible delay in payment between each two-level set of players has not been considered in the literature. Such a situation is very common in real life and a thorough analysis of the real scenarios 52

involved would allow us to provide useful recommendations that more accurately reflect the structure and practices of a three-level supply chain. In this model, the manufacturer purchases raw material from the supplier and converts it into finished goods, following Hill's (1997) policy, according to which the manufacturer produces and ships to the retailer during the production period. Specifically, this chapter considers a supplier, a manufacturer, and a retailer coordinating their decisions through delay in payment. During each period, the supplier offers the manufacturer a delay in payment period, after which the supplier starts charging interest to the manufacturer on any outstanding balance. Also, the manufacturer offers the retailer a permissible delay in payment period during which the retailer pays no interest on any outstanding balance, and after which the manufacturer starts charging the retailer an interest on any outstanding amount. This chapter considers a centralized decision-making model with the delay in payments, in which the three players coordinate their decisions of how much to order from the upstream player, and how to set the length of the permissible delay in payment. In this chapter, the duration of the delay in payment period is a decision variable to be determined by the upstream player. Nine real-life scenarios are considered in this study to cover all possible real situations that might occur in practice when a permissible delay in payments is integrated into the supply chain.

The problem in this chapter is modeled and solved, first by assuming a common cycle length for all the three different players, and then, by assuming uncommon 53

cycle length. Using simulation, this chapter compares the performance of the two models corresponding to each of the two assumptions and conclude that adopting the common cycle length assumption considerably reduces the total supply chain costs when compared to uncommon cycle length. Adopting the common cycle length assumption, a simulation run was conducted for 10,000 numerical examples that were randomly generated with a uniform distribution and solved for each of the nine scenarios, with varying the input parameters randomly in specific ranges. The first is a comparison of the total supply chain cost under the case when no delay in payment is offered in each of the nine scenarios of the model with the delay in payment. It has been observed that the total supply chain cost is the highest when no permissible delay in payment is offered. Among the nine scenarios of the delay in payment model, the total cost is the lowest in the case when the manufacturer settles its balance to the supplier beyond the permissible delay period and before receiving the next shipment from the supplier, and the retailer settles his/her balance by the end of the delay in payment period. This chapter analyzes the effect of each input parameters on the total supply chain's cost under each scenario and identifies the parameters with a significant effect on the total cost. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for each of the nine scenarios, by varying the interest rates and holding costs of each player, and the demand to production ratio. For each sensitivity case, the total cost is obtained for all the different scenarios and the lowest cost is identified. This allows the different players in practice to identify the best scenario that will optimize the entire supply chain cost, based on the 54

specific values of their interest rates, holding costs, and demand to production ratio.

4.2 Assumptions and Notations
This chapter considers the following assumptions:  The supply chain consists of a single supplier, a single manufacturer and a single retailer.  Demand at the manufacturer and retailer is deterministic and constant over time.  Production rate of the supplier is greater than the demand of the manufacturer for raw material, and the manufacturer's production rate is greater than and retailer's demand.     Shortages are not allowed. All shipments in this supply chain are equal-sized shipments. The system has a single product. The holding costs consist of two components: financial and physical holding costs.  A permissible delay in payment is offered by the supplier to the manufacturer and by the manufacturer to the retailer.  The permissible delay is assumed to be a decision variable.

55



The manufacturer and the retailer invest what they owe to their vendors (supplier or manufacturer) in a risk-free investment during the permissible period.



The retailer and the manufacturer pay the balance on their account in a single payment by .



The manufacturer has two individual warehouses: one for the raw materials and the other for the finished goods.

The following notations have been used to develop the mathematical models of this chapter: Corresponds to the supply chain member as indicated by the i subscript (i.e. `s' for supplier, `m' for manufacturer and `r' for retailer) Corresponds to the inventory level at the supply chain member as indicated by the subscript (i.e. `w' for raw material and `f' for  finished goods), where j=0 when the member has a single inventory e.g. As stands for the setup cost for the supplier and Am,w stands for the order cost of the manufacturer's raw material. , , , ,  1 Setup/order cost for player `i' Production/purchasing cost per item for player `i' Financial holding cost per item for player 'i' Physical (storage) holding cost per item for player `i Order quantity for the buyer Number of shipments delivered by the supplier to the manufacturer -per the manufacturer's raw material cycle

The system that is presented in this chapter is a three-level supply chain (supplier-manufacturer-retailer), as illustrated in Figure 4.1. The retailer orders a lot size  from the manufacturer at the beginning of each retailer's cycle, and the manufacturer produces and then delivers an equal lot size shipment by the end of each retailer's cycle . The retailer is permitted by the manufacturer to delay the payment of each shipment for an interest-free period ( ). Accordingly, the retailer will not pay anything at the time of receiving the shipment. Similarly, the manufacturer orders from the supplier 57
2  1 

at the beginning of each raw

material's cycle, and the supplier ships the equal lot size shipment accordingly. The manufacturer will not pay the supplier at the time of the receiving the raw materials due to the permissible delay that is offered by the supplier. To investigate all the possible scenarios that could be encountered in a real-life setting, this chapter considers nine scenarios as illustrated in the next section.

4.3 Mathematical model
This section provides the mathematical models of a coordinated three-level supply chain, with the permissible delay in payment considered as a decision variable. In order to adequately compare between the scenarios, two major assumptions are considered in the calculations: a common cycle length between the players, and an uncommon cycle length. Then, the assumption with the minimal resulting total cost will be adopted for the rest of the chapter.

4.3.1 Common cycle length
In this case a common cycle length is considered when formulating the mathematical models, where the cycle length is  = inventory and the common cycle length.

Figure 4.1: Inventory behavior for a common cycle assumption.

The manufacturer adopts the production policy of Hill (1997), where the manufacturer delivers shipments of equal sizes at equal intervals of produced items to the retailer over its cycle including during the production segment. The manufacturer builds inventory, to a maximum, after the first shipment, where the manufacturer's inventory hits zero after it is shipped out to the retailer. The

59

next manufacturer's cycle starts once all shipments are delivered to the retailer. The different scenarios under this assumption are as follows: 4.3.1.1. Scenario I-I 0   =  
2  1

& 0   =    :



In this scenario, it is assumed that the supplier grants the manufacturer  units of time to settle its payment without interest charges. The manufacturer pays its balance by the end of this period ( ). In addition, it is assumed that the manufacturer grants the retailer  units of time to settle its payment without interest charges; however, the retailer may find it beneficial to settle its payment by time  . For this scenario, it has been considered the case when  =  and  =  (refer to Appendix A for detailer derivations). Therefore, the supplier's total annual cost, that includes setup, production, physical and financial holding costs, can be written as follows:

1,I  =

(1 - 1)( +  ) 2    +   + +    + ( -  )    2  21 -  , 
 ( - )

(4.1)

It is assumed that the manufacturer invests , , which is owed to the supplier, in a risk-free investment. Correspondingly, the manufacturer's raw material annual cost, which includes order, purchasing, storage and financial holding costs and interest earnings, is as follows:

(4.2)

In addition, it is assumed that the manufacturer allows the retailer a period (interest-free) to settle its payment  . However, this will cost the manufacturer the opportunity to invest the money it should have received from the retailer. Accordingly, the manufacturer's annual cost, which includes setup, production, holding and losing opportunity costs, is:

I-I , =

,  (2 + ( - )2 - ) + ,  + (, + , ) ( ) + ,   2  2 + ( - , )   -   ( -)

(4.3)

Similarly, for the manufacturer's raw material outstanding balance, it is assumed that the retailer invests the balance owed   to the manufacturer in a risk-free investment. Therefore, the retailer's annual cost, which includes order, purchasing and holding costs (storage and financial), and interest earnings, is as follows:
I-I  =

( ( -  )2 )     +   + + +  ( ( -) -    )  2 2

4.3.1.2. Scenario I-II 0   =

& 0   <    :



This scenario assumes that the manufacturer settles its balance with the supplier by the end of the permissible period given by the supplier, and the 62

retailer settles its balance payments with the manufacturer beyond the permissible period given by the manufacturer, and before receiving the next shipment. In addition, the retailer invests the balance it owes to the manufacturer ( ) in a risk-free investment. Therefore, the retailer's annual cost is as follows:
- 

   ( -  )2   = +   + + +  ( ( - ) -    )  2 2

(4.7)

4.3.2 Uncommon cycle length
The purpose of this section is to illustrate the adoption of an uncommon cycle length approach in constructing the mathematical models. In this case, the total cost model per cycle for each player has to be divided by the cycle length of the player. For illustrative purposes, the total cost model per cycle of the supplier under scenario I-I is as follows:
I-I  = As +  2  +

1 (1 - 1) 2  2 ( +  ) ( 2 2 ) +   2  2 1

(4.31)

The total cost of the supplier per unit per year is determined by dividing Eq. (4.31) by the cycle length of the supplier (, =
I-I  = 2  

), which becomes as follows:

As  1 (1 - 1) 2  ( +  ) ( 2 ) +    + (, -  )   +   + 2  2 1 - ,   (- )

(4.32)

The mathematics for the other scenarios can be easily determined following the same procedure as in Eq.(4.32) , and for keeping the chapter concise they have been left out. Figure 4.2 shows the different cycle lengths for each player involved in the supply chain.

4.4 Numerical results
In this section, numerical examples are presented to differentiate between all scenarios that were developed in Section 4.3, when a delay in payment is considered as a coordination mechanism in a three-level (supplier-

manufacturer-retailer) supply chain. The length of the permissible period and 75

the time of the payments are considered as decision variables. The purpose of the numerical examples is to identify the best scenario that gives minimal total cost under permissible delay in payments. The values of the input parameters and their ranges used in the numerical examples are from the literature. The values of the financial and physical holding costs are determined as suggested by Waters (2008). The number of simulation runs was decided to cover a wider range of possible numerical examples. Also, it was mentioned in Burton et al. (2009) that the number of runs varied from 100 to 100 000 runs. Increasing the number of runs in a simulation reduces the error percentage. For example, in the numerical analysis, the annual demand was varied for a thousand run, which gave an error range of 0.34% to 4.08% with a standard deviation of 1.12%. Then, the simulation was run five thousand times and found that the error range was from 0.32% to 3.92% with a standard deviation of 1.17%. Finally, it was run ten thousand times, and the error ranged from 0.35% to 1.61% with a standard deviation of 0.46%. Accordingly, ten thousand runs are considered in the numerical example as it provides good accuracy of the analysis and the computational time is reasonable; the ranges of the input parameters are shown in Table 4.1. The physical holding cost ranges between 9% and 20% of the unit cost and the financial holding cost ranges between 10% and 15% of the unit cost. One of the assumptions in this chapter is to avoid shortages; to satisfy this assumption the production rate was always kept greater than the demand rate. In addition, the value of the product increases as it moves down the supply chain. This assumption is kept when solving the numerical examples by having 76

the financial and physical holding costs of the supplier the lowest and those of the retailer the highest of the three levels.

4.4.1 Comparison between uncommon and common cycle length
Using simulation, the worst and best numerical examples were used to compare between the common and uncommon cycles in each scenario, as illustrated in Table 4.2. Ten thousand numerical examples were solved. The results showed that having a common cycle is always cheaper for the supply chain. Accordingly, the numerical examples and the discussion from this point will be based on the common cycle length assumption.

4.4.2 Detailed examples for common cycle length
For illustrative purposes, a numerical example was selected randomly and is presented in this section, where Table 4.3 shows the input parameters for this numerical example. Solver is one of the analysis tools available in Microsoft Excel that is used for optimization problems. It was used to find the minimum total cost by setting 1 , 2 ,  ,  ,  and  as decision variables. In the calculations of the numerical examples, the purchasing of raw materials and the production costs (some of the fixed costs in the system) at the manufacturer have been neglected, to clarify the difference between the total costs.

Table 4.4 illustrates the results of the numerical example for nine scenarios, and a scenario without the permissible delay in payments. The results show that the supplier achieves its minimum cost when no delay in payments is offered to downstream players. The reason is that the supplier's rate of return is very low. The manufacturer attains its minimum cost under scenario III-II because it does not incur a financial holding cost, generates profit from investment during the delay period, and receives interest from the retailer on a delay balance. The

retailer achieves its minimum cost under scenario III-III, since the retailer does not incur a financial holding cost for items in its inventory and has more time to invest its money before paying the manufacturer. As this chapter considers a centralized system, the decision of the best scenario is made based on the scenario that minimizes the total system cost (i.e. scenario II-I), where 1 = 1, 2 = 2,  = 0,  = 0.1068,  =  = 0.0181,   = 296 and the total cost is 77,405.45 $/ year.

Note: Numerical examples are the number of examples that the corresponding scenario (the first column) achieved the best minimum cost from the 10,000 numerical examples, R= Ranking is based on the number of numerical example that each corresponding scenario achieved the best minimum total cost from the simulation run.

Ten thousand numerical examples were randomly generated and solved under the nine scenarios. Table 4.5 summarizes the results of the simulation run. It shows the number of numerical examples for each corresponding delay in payments' scenario that achieved the best minimum cost among the other scenarios. The results in Table 4.5 also show the average total cost for these numerical examples and the difference in the average total cost and the average cost for each scenario (on the same row). For example, the third row was for scenario I-II, and the number of numerical examples where it achieved the best minimum total cost was 106 numerical examples from the 10,000 numerical examples (simulation run). The average cost for the 106 numerical example was $327,436 and it achieved a lower average total cost that was $569 less than when no delay is adopted. To form a conclusion about the most preferable scenario, a regression analysis was run for the 10,000 numerical examples with the dependent variables being the permissible periods, the number of shipments and the total cost of the supply chain. The regression analyses show that the following input parameters, ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  and  , significantly affect the total cost in all scenarios. Moreover, the holding cost of the raw materials ( ) has a significant effect on the total cost when delay in payments is not offered in a supply chain. In addition, the retailer's interest rate ( ) has a significant effect in the following scenarios, I-III, II-III and III-III. However, the analysis shows that the supplier's interest rate ( ) has an insignificant effect on the total cost in all scenarios. The production rate () is one of the input parameters having an insignificant effect 82

in scenarios I-III and II-III. In addition, the manufacturer interest rate ( ) has an insignificant effect when there is no delay in payments applied in coordinating the supply chain and in scenario I-III. Table 4.6 illustrates the coefficients of each input parameter in all scenarios.

Note: The coefficient values show how much the total cost would increase (decrease) when a parameter increases (decreases) by one unit.

In the simulation run, different cases have been considered. First, the ratio of demand over the production rate is varied between 0.1 ­ 0.99. Also, all scenarios are tested under five possible cases of interest as illustrated in Table 4.7. The first case,  >  >  , is when the interest rate of the manufacturer is between the supplier's and the retailers', with the retailer having the highest interest rate. The second case,  >  >  , is when the interest rate of the manufacturer is 83

the highest, and so on, as illustrated in Table 4.7. Moreover, different possible cases of comparing the holding cost between the players are considered in Table 4.8.

4.5 Managerial insights
Permissible delay in payments has been widely implemented as a business practice as it is a coordination mechanism that helps companies in reducing their total cost. For instance, Walmart has achieved a 1.2% reduction in its capital expenditures by having a one-month delay in payment (Murfin & Njoroge, 2015). The permissible period varies across companies, from just a few weeks to months, as in the case of Walmart. The scenarios and cases presented in this chapter considered the delay in payments offered between adjacent players in a supply chain as a decision variable. One may argue if such an approach is practical. However, the suggested approach provides some guidelines to decision makers in a supply chain when negotiating credit terms and payments schedules. For instance, it is best when the three players coordinate using a permissible delay in payment and operate under scenario II-I, i.e. when the manufacturer settles its balance beyond the permissible delay period and before receiving the new shipment from the supplier, while the retailer settles its balance before the end of the permissible delay period. This can be achieved by sharing the additional supply chain profit proportionally among the three players, so all of the players have an incentive to operate under the best scenario.

88

The results are insensitive to the demand to production ratio, as the best scenario is mostly the same for different values of the ratio. An important outcome of the analysis is to provide decision makers with insights into which parameters significantly affect the total cost, so a closer look at these parameters is required, versus the ones that can be ignored. For instance, the raw material holding cost does not have a significant effect on the total cost, unlike manufacturer's and retailer's holding cost parameters. Thus, actions and best practices towards reducing the holding costs at the manufacturer and retailer are important to keep the supply chain cost low. Also, the supplier's and retailer's interest rates can be ignored as they are insignificant in affecting the supply chain's cost, unlike the manufacturer's interest rate. The production rate is another parameter that needs to be closely monitored as it significantly affects the cost, in addition to the fixed setup costs for each player. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to study the effect of the relative comparison of the interest rates on the best scenario. Based on the relative ranking of the interest rates, decision makers can simply identify the best scenario and work together to operate under this specific scenario to minimize the total supply chain cost.

89

4.6 Summary and Conclusions
This chapter considers a three-level supply chain (supplier-manufacturerretailer) with the permissible delay in payments as a decision variable. The supplier offers a permissible delay in payments to the manufacturer who, in turn, offers the retailer a permissible delay. The chapter investigates nine different possible scenarios that occur in real life when a permissible delay in payments is used as a coordination mechanism. Ten thousand numerical examples were considered to compare between all nine scenarios. In addition, the case when no permissible delay is assumed was considered. A numerical example was selected randomly out of these ten thousand to illustrate the behavior of each scenario. For the supplier, it is better not to have a permissible delay between the players in order to minimize its total cost. The manufacturer reduces its total cost to the best minimal cost when the supply chain follows scenario III-II. The retailer gets its best minimal cost when the supply chain follows scenario I-III. However, the best scenario that generates the minimal total cost for the whole supply chain is scenario II-I. Regression analyses were conducted to analyze the simulation run of ten thousand numerical examples, to illustrate which input parameters have a significant effect in each scenario. The input parameters that do not have a significant effect were  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  and  . Ranking the best scenarios, it was observed that scenarios II-I, I-I and II-II are the best three. The worst three performing ones are I-III, II-III and III-III. A sensitivity analysis

90

was implemented to check the limitations of the proposed model. All scenarios were tested under five different interest rates cases of interest rate comparison, besides varying the ratio of demand to production rate. The total cost of all scenarios increase by increasing the ratio of  . Under each interest case and for each ratio considered, the scenario that attains the best minimal total cost is scenario II-I, where the manufacturer settles its balance beyond the permitted period and the retailer settles its balance by the end of the delay's period. In summary, it was concluded that the best scenario to follow is II-I when coordinating a three-level of the supply chain with the permissible delay in payments. First, it achieved the best minimal total cost in 70% of the cases of the simulation run. Second, this scenario helps the manufacturer in managing its financial flow, as the manufacturer would first receive the payment from the retailer and then pay the supplier. Third, although the total cost difference between all scenarios is small, it is better to execute a single scenario instead of alternating between multiple scenarios, which could cost more effort and time; a positive result could be achieved by getting all players in the chain to agree upon the scenario II-I. The models that are presented in this chapter can be extended in different possible directions. First, one option is to investigate the effect of the permissible delay in payments under different production policies rather than Hill's (1997). Second, assuming a stochastic demand and including a production policy at the supplier is another possible extension. One can also consider multiple un-identical retailers and suppliers.

CHAPTER 5 : Coordination of a three-level supply chain (supplier-manufacturer-retailer) with delay in payments and price discounts

92

5.1 Introduction
Global market changes, such as the drop in oil prices, rapid product development, high product variety, and short product life cycle, have dramatically increased competition among companies, making it more difficult to sustain the desired levels of profitability. One of the most useful tools that can help industries to survive is enhancing and optimizing their supply chains. Supply Chain Management (SCM) is defined as the planning and analysis of all processes involved in acquiring and delivering raw material and components, transforming them into finished products and selling to customers. SCM has been the focus of researchers and practitioners, as effective supply chain management tools have resulted in document improvements in performance for many firms. A supply chain can be coordinated by adopting different mechanisms. The Joint Economic Lot Sizing (JELS), which was first studied by Banerjee (1986b) and Goyal (1977), is perhaps the most common coordination mechanism used in the literature. It minimizes the total supply chain cost by treating the lot size and the number of shipments as decision variables (Jaber and Zolfaghari (2008), Ben-Daya, Darwish and Ertogral (2008) and Glock (2012)). Although JELS minimizes the supply chain, not all members would benefit as the savings would cluster with a few players in the chain. The buyer is the one who is most likely to doubt this process, as the JELS suggests a lot size larger than its economic order quantity. So, the coordination of a supply chain has to include incentive schemes to entice the buyer and make it work.

93

Many incentive schemes were introduced and studied in the literature e.g. permissible delay-in-payments, price/quantity discounts, common

replenishment period and consignment stocks (e.g., Jaber and Zolfaghari (2008), Seifert, Seifert and Protoppa-Sieke (2013)). Permissible delay-in-payments is a coordination mechanism that allows a buyer (customer) to settle its balance with a supplier (vendor) by a specified period without being charged interest on the amount owed (an interest-free period). However, if the buyer settles its payment after the permitted period, interest is charged on the unpaid balance until it is settled. The advantage for the buyer is that the cash owed to the supplier/vendor can be invested during the permissible period for some return. Reduction in price, or price discounts, which is widely applied in practice, is usually offered by a supplier/vendor to its customers (buyers) to entice them to order in larger quantities. There are two types of price discounts: all-unit discount, which applies to all items purchased in every order, and incremental discount, which applies only if the customer's order quantity falls within a certain quantity range Offering a price discount along with permissible delay-in-payments was suggested by many consultants and practitioners. Deloitte indicated that, in practice, some businesses offer a discount for early-paying customers (Bryk, Lee, Thibault, & Stewien, 2016). Similarly, Bertsch, the founder of Dryun, a software developer of accounting and cash flow management, recommends business owners to speed up the payments of their customer by offering price discounts 94

(Bertsch, 2016). To the best of the author's knowledge, integrating price discount along with a permissible delay in payment has not been investigated in the literature. Herein is the contribution of this work. This chapter presents a coordination of a three-level (supplier-manufacturer-retailer) supply chain system by integrating two coordination mechanisms, delay-in-payments and price discounts. To reflect the real-life scenarios that are encountered in practice, this chapter analyzes detailed cases of permissible delay and price discounts. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 5.2 lists the notation and assumptions. Section 5.3 presents the mathematical models. Section 5.4 provides numerical examples and sensitivity analysis. In Section 5.5, a discussion of the managerial implications and recommendations is presented. Finally, the conclusion of this study presented in Section 5.6.

5.2 Assumptions and notations
This chapter considers the following assumptions:  The supply chain consists of a supplier, a manufacturer and a retailer (buyer).  A single product consisting of multiple () raw materials is produced and sold.   The demand is discount dependent. The supplier's production rate is greater than the manufacturer's demand for raw materials, and the production rate of finished goods at the manufacturer is greater than the retailer's demand. 95

 

Shortages are not allowed. The manufacturer's production policy follows that of Hill (Hill, 1997), where equal batches are produced, and equal-sized shipments are made.

 

The holding cost consists of two components: physical and financial. Price discount and permissible delay-in-payments are offered respectively by the supplier to the manufacturer and by the manufacturer to the retailer.



Price discounts and the permissible delay-in-payments are decision variables.



During the permissible period, the manufacturer and the retailer invest the accumulated balances.

 

The manufacturer and the retailer pay their balances in single payments. The maximum price discount that is offered by the supplier, manufacturer, or retailer cannot exceed the profit margin.

The following notations have been used to develop the mathematical models: Corresponds to the supply chain member as indicated by the  subscript (i.e. `s' for supplier, ` ' for manufacturer's raw material, `m' for manufacturer's finished goods, `' for retailer and ` ' for customer)  Setup/order cost for player ` '

The supply chain system presented in this chapter consists of a three-level supply chain (supplier-manufacturer-retailer), as illustrated in Figure 5.1. In this system, the retailer orders a lot size  of finished items for an annual demand rate of  units. The manufacturer produces finished items at an annual rate of  units, where  > . In addition, the manufacturer orders  from the supplier, where  is the number of raw material units required to manufacture one finished product.

The retailer may postpone its payment to the manufacturer till after  , where the manufacturer charges an interest rate,  , on any outstanding balance. The retailer invests the balance it owes to the manufacturer at an interest rate,  . Besides offering delay in payments, a price discount is offered from each upstream supply chain party to the downstream one.

5.3 Mathematical model
This section presents the mathematical models of coordinating a three-level supply chain (supplier-manufacturer-retailer) with delay in payment and price discount. There are nine possible scenarios of delay in payments that would occur in real practice between the players in the considered supply chain. The profit function for each player in the following models is the annual revenue minus the annual cost. Therefore, the supplier's annual revenue ( ) includes revenue from selling raw materials to the manufacturer ((, -  )( )) and from interest charges that will be paid by the manufacturer ((, -  )( )(  (, - ) - 1)). Accordingly, the annual revenue for the supplier can be written as follows:

 ( , , ,  ,  ) = (, -  )( ) + (, -  )( )(  (,- ) - 1)

(5.1)

In addition the total annual cost for the supplier ( ) that includes setup cost (
 ( ) 2 

), production cost of raw materials ( ( )), financial and storage
(1 -1) 2

holding costs (

( +  )

2 ( ) 1

), financial holding cost due to the delay

offered to the manufacturer ( , ( )) and losing opportunity of investing the profit from sales in a risk-free investment due to the delay in payments ((, -  -  )( )(   - 1)). Thus, the total annual cost for the supplier is as follows: 100

 ( , , , 1 , 2 ,  ) = (1 - 1)  ( ) 2 ( ) ( +  ) +  ( ) + +  , ( ) 2  2 1
(5.2)

+ (, -  -  )( )(  - 1)

As a result, the total annual profit for the supplier ( ) is equal to Eq. (5.1) minus Eq. (5.2)
 ( , , , 1 , 2 ,  ,  ) = ((, -  )( ) + (, -  )( )( (,-) - 1)) - (
 ( ) + 2 

 ( ) +

(1 -1) 2

( +  )

2 ( ) + 1

 , ( ) + (, -  -

(5.3)

 )( )(   - 1))

In addition, the total annual revenue for the manufacturer ( ) includes revenue from selling the finished products to the retailer (( -  )( )), interest charges that will be paid by the retailer to the manufacturer if the retailer settles its balance with the manufacturer beyond the permitted delay period (( -  )( )( ( -) - 1)) and the interest earned during the permissible period offered by the supplier ((, -  )( )( , - 1)). The annual revenue for the manufacturer can be written as follows:
 ( , , ,  ,  ,  ,  ) = ( -  )( ) + ( -  )( )( ( -) - 1) + (, -  )( )( , - 1)
(5.4)

Moreover, the total annual cost for the manufacturer ( ) includes the order cost of raw materials (
1 , ( ) 2 

), purchasing cost of raw materials ((, -

101

 )( )), storage holding cost for the raw materials in inventory (

, 2 ( ) 21

),

financial holding costs of raw materials in inventory (, (,  , , )), interest charges if the manufacturer settles its balance with the supplier beyond the permissible period offered by the supplier ((, -  )( )( (, - ) - 1)), setup cost of finished products (
 ( ) 2 

), production cost of finished products

( ( )), financial and storage holding costs for finished goods in the inventory (( +  ) [
(2( )+(-( ))2 -) 2

]), financial holding costs due to offering a

permissible delay for the retailer (  ( )) and the losing opportunity of investing the profit of the manufacturer during the permissible period offered to the retailer (( -  -  )( )(  - 1)). Thus, the annual total cost for the manufacturer is as follows:
 (,  , , , 1 , 2 ,  ,  ,  ) =
1 , ( ) 2 

+ (, -  )( ) +
 ( ) + 2

In the case of settling the balance after receiving the next shipment in a single payment, the inventory of the player will be zero. Therefore, some of the financial holding costs illustrated in Table 1 are zeros.

5.4 Numerical example
In this section, a numerical example is first solved for a given set of parameter values, when a delay in payment is not offered and for each of the delay in payments' nine scenarios presented in Section 3. Each scenario has been investigated for different cases of price discounts. Then, a sensitivity analysis is performed to analyze all models developed in this chapter when varying certain parameters. Throughout the numerical analysis, the objective is to maximize the supply chain total annual profit. The decision variables comprise the length of the permissible delay periods ( and  ), the length of the extended delay times ( and  ) and the price discounts ( ,  ,  ). The scenarios considered in Section 3 are analyzed, in addition to eight different price discount cases under each scenario. A price discount case denoted by (0,0,1) indicates that only the retailer offers a price discount to its customer, while (1,1,1) implies that each player among the supplier, manufacturer and retailer offers a price discount to the downstream party. Accordingly, 0 means that no price discount is offered, while 1 indicates that a price discount is offered by the supplier, manufacturer, and the retailer respectively, in the above notation. The purpose of considering all different scenarios is to identify the combination of a delay in payments scenario and price discount that maximizes the annual total profit of a three-

106

level supply chain (supplier-manufacturer-retailer) and gain managerial insights that would help in guiding the decision makers' actions in each stage of the supply chain. First, one numerical example that has been setup based on surveying a few papers that have investigated the coordination of a three-level supply chain is shown; e.g. Jaber et al. (2006), Moussawi-Haidar et al. (2014), and Aljazzar et al. (2016). The parameters of the numerical example are as follows:  = 1,000 units/year, 1 = 70, = 3,000 unit/year,  = 1, = 264 $/order, = 20 $/unit,  = 3 $/unit/year,  = 2 $/unit/year,  =10 % ,  =355 $/order,  = 28 $/unit,  = 4.2 $/unit/year,  = 2.8 $/unit/year,  = 125 $/order,  = 50 $/unit,  = 7.5 $/unit/year,  =5 $/unit/year,  = 8 %,  = 242 $/order,  = 70 $/unit,  = 10.5 $/unit/year,  = 7 $/unit/year,  = 5%,  = 98$/unit. Table 2 illustrates the results of the numerical example under all scenarios and price discount combinations. Solver (an add-on for Microsoft Excel) was utilized to maximize the total profit of the proposed supply chain by setting 1 , 2 ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  and  as decision variables and finding their optimal values. Table 5.2 illustrates the optimal results of the numerical example for all scenarios.

The results of the numerical example showed that the majority of delay in payments scenarios obtained their maximum profit when the price discount is offered by the manufacturer and the retailer (0,1,1). However, the maximum total profit for the supply chain is achieved when the manufacturer settles its balance with the supplier by the end of the permitted period, and the retailer settles its balance with the manufacturer beyond the permissible period and before receiving the next shipment (I-II). In addition, the price discount is offered by the supplier and by the retailer (1,0,1) along with a delay in payments. Also, the results showed that offering a mixed trade credit of delay in payment and price discounts increases the total profit of the supply chain. It is noticed that the optimal solution of many cases is not to offer a price discount e.g. the total profit of scenario I-II under case (0,0,0) is the same as scenario I-II case (0,1,0). The reason behind that is that the optimal solution in scenario I-II under case (0,1,0) suggests not to offer a discount for the retailer, which reduces to the case of not offering a discount between all players (0,0,0). Table 5.3 ranks from highest to lowest profit the different combinations of delay in payments and price discounts. The results show that a (1,1,1) policy is dominant, offering delay in payments along with price discounts.

Next, two sensitivity analyses are performed to investigate all developed models under changing critical input parameters, i.e. varying customers' elasticity to discount and varying the interest rate for all players. First, when varying the customer's elasticity from 0 to 100, i.e. the increment of customers toward a onedollar discount offered by the retailer. When the elasticity of the customer to discount is between 0 and 40, all scenarios of delay in payments are insensitive to the elasticity. Scenario I-I achieved its maximum total profit when the supplier and the manufacturer offer a price discount to their customers which is under case (1,1,0). Scenarios I-II and I-III obtained their maximum profit when the supplier offers a price discount to the manufacturer under cases (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0) and (1,1,1). The remaining delay in payments' scenarios achieved their maximum total profit when the discount is offered by the manufacturer to the retailer, i.e. (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,1,0) and (1,1,1). The total profits for these cases are the same because both supplier and retailer are not offering a discount. Offering a discount by the supplier and the retailer under those cases will reduce the total profit. Incurring holding costs and interest charges for long periods as in this scenario III-III, prevent the system of offering a discount to maximize the total profit. The maximum total profit obtained when the elasticity of the

111

customer is between 0 and 40 was $ 21,600.34 under scenario I-II under the discount cases where the supplier offers a discount to the manufacturer. However, all cases are sensitive to the price discount offerred by the retailer to customers, and very sensitive to when demand elasticity is between 50 to 100. The total profit in those cases increases with the increase of the elasticity. The best total profit that the system achieved while varying the customer's elasticity was $ 27,100.13 under the scenario I-II when the supplier and the retailer offer a discount to their customers (1,0,1) and (1,1,1). The optimality of maximizing the total profit forces the manufacturer not to offer a discount. Accordingly, both cases (1,0,1) and (1,1,1) achieved the same total profit. Another sensitivity result is obtained by varying the interest rate combinations between the three players. Thirteen possible interest combinations, illustrated in Table 5.4, have been considered for the 72 cases of combining delay in payments' scenarios with price discount's cases.

It is observed that when the retailer's interest rate is equal to the manufacturer's interest rate but greater than the supplier's interest rate ( =  >  ), all cases of combining a delay in payments with a price discount, i.e. (1,1,1), obtained their highest total profit compared to the remaining interest combinations. However, all delay in payments cases without a price discount (0,0,0) obtained their best total profit when the retailer's interest rate is higher than the interest rate of the manufacturer, and the interest rate of the manufacturer is higher than the supplier's interest rate ( >  >  ). The best total profit between all cases considered in this analysis was obtained when the manufacturer settles its balance by the end of the permissible period, and the retailer settles its balance beyond the permissible period that offered by the manufacturer and before receiving the next shipment, (I-II) and when the retailer offers a discount to its customer (0,0,1), where the total profit was $24,399.42/year. Although, scenario I-II under case (0,0,1) achieved the highest total profit, the difference between the highest total profit and the one achieved by following scenario I-II with case (1,0,1) was 0.01%. The worst total profit was attained when the manufacturer settles its balance beyond the permissible period and after receiving the next shipment as well as the retailer and when price discount is not offered along with the delay in payments (0,0,0), the total was $21,081.78 /year. Table 5.5 presents the best and worst four total profit to interest combinations, delay in payments' scenarios, price discount's cases and the amounts of total profit.

The following recommendations are based on the numerical and sensitivity analysis performed in the previous section.



It is shown numerically that jointly offering two types of trade credits to entice coordination increases the total profit of the supply chain more than offering only one type of a trade credit as has been done in the literature. This makes a larger pool of savings available for the supply chain members that could be used to compensate the losing players from coordination (usually the player that will operate off its optimal policy), to invest in programs that improve supply chain performance, and to have some additional profits.



The best permissible delay in payment's scenario that provides a wide flexibility is I-II, as it achieved the best maximum profit under different conditions.



Since customer demand is the driver of the supply chain, then offering a price discount by the retailer will always increase the chances of achieving 114

the maximum profit possible for the system. It also increases the retailer's, and subsequently the manufacturer's and the supplier's, market share.  Although the supply chain is making a profit, some players in a few cases were losing money. In this case, it would be fair to have profit sharing agreements among the players, whether if it is based on the investment that each player puts in the chain (ROI) or by compensating the losing player from the total profit and then sharing the remaining profit.

5.5 Summary and Conclusions:
This chapter presents a model for integrating two coordination mechanisms to coordinate a three-level-supply chain (supplier-manufacturer-retailer). Those coordination mechanisms, price discount and delay in payments, were treated as decision variables and were implemented between all players in the supply chain. The chapter investigates nine possible scenarios of delay in payments along with eight cases of a price discount, representing all cases that might occur in practice. A numerical example was solved to compare combinations of all scenarios and cases studied in this chapter. The numerical example was selected based on surveying couple of papers that investigated the coordination of a three-level supply chain. The best scenario was I-II under case (0,0,1) as the retailer is the only player in the supply chain to offer a price discount to its customers. Adopting this scenario will result in an increase of the profit of about 10.3 %.

115

Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the limitations of the models developed in this chapter. The first analysis was to vary the customers' elasticity to price discount. Scenario I-II and the following case (1,0,1) for price discounts achieved the highest profit between all combinations. The second analysis was to test the models when varying the rate of return of each player. The analysis shows that scenario I-II under case (0,0,1) achieved the highest total supply chain profit under most categories. In summary, it is concluded that combining delay in payments and price discount will increase the total profit rather than implement each mechanism separately. Also, the best scenario to follow is scenario I-II under (1,0,1) when coordinating a three-level of a supply chain with the permissible delay in payments and price discount. First, it has achieved the best maximum profit for the supply chain when varying the customers' elasticity and the interest combination. Second, this scenario shows a higher flexibility than other cases, when it comes to varying the rate of return (interest rate) and varying customers' elasticity. The models presented in this chapter can be extended in different directions. First, one could incorporate a fixed delay in payment across the supply chain, as the current practice is for so many successful supply chains, and compare it with results in this chapter, in order to present guidance, better understanding, and better decision making for businesses. Also, assuming demand to be stochastic in the presence of multiple players at different levels is another possible extension. 116

CHAPTER 6 : Delays-in-payments - a strategy to reduce additional carbon emissions from supply chains

117

6.1 Introduction
This chapter analyzes the environmental and economic performance of a twolevel coordinated supply chain when a delay-in-payments (trade credit) is offered by a vendor to a buyer. Different scenarios of delay in payments are considered along with fuel cost, and the costs of emissions from manufacturing and transportation. The chapter also provides some insights for practitioners for optimizing the environmental and economic performance of a supply chain system. One of the main objectives of a supply chain is to improve economic performance (Beamon, 1999b). The cost of carbon emissions is generally ignored in sourcing decisions. However, it becomes an important decision variable in supply chains, where the cost of emissions is applicable because sourcing decisions affect the carbon footprint of a supply chain system and hence, for the partnered organizations. The importance of accurately measuring, reporting and reducing the carbon footprint of a supply chain is increasing. As an example of an aggressive target for reducing carbon footprint, Mexico is aiming for a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 as compared to 2000 (Güereca, Torres, & Noyola, 2013). In another example, a recent study found that many of the large firms in the United States reported 22% of their full Scope 3 emissions in 2013 (Blanco, Caro, & Corbett, 2016). The setup, order, and holding costs are the major aggregated components of a supply chain total cost (Waters, 2003). The order cost includes transport cost among other costs, which also includes fuel cost, driver's salary, a portion of 118

vehicle's purchase cost, and vehicle maintenance cost among other costs (Waters, 2003). Firms usually aggregate them for the ease of calculation and negotiation. However, the aggregation of costs does not show the effect of a certain cost that could be increasing at a rate faster than those of the other costs in the bundle. The fuel cost, a component of the transport cost, falls in this category (Gurtu et al., 2015). Although crude oil prices have declined over the past few years, fuel prices have not declined proportionately and fuel prices are still much higher than the long-term overall inflation prices. Therefore, the price of fuel in transport cost and supply chains is still important and should be considered separately. Delay-in-payments favors that a manufacturer produces and delivers large and equal-sized quantities to a buyer, a practice that saves money and generates profits. However, producing more and making more deliveries increases emissions from production and transportation activities and consumes fossil fuel, a non-renewable resource. This suggests two conflicting objectives, one economical and the other environmental. This chapter studies the combined effects of delay-in-payments and some environmental issues on the performance of a supply chain. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: Section 6.2 presents the assumptions and notations, followed by a mathematical model in Section 6.3. Numerical examples that demonstrate the application of the model are presented in Section 6.4, with the results discussed in Section 6.5. Managerial insights are provided in Section 6.6. Section 6.7 concludes the

119

chapter with a discussion of the implications of the model on the future of supply chains.

6.2 Assumptions and notations
There are many unstated assumptions. Some important assumptions are:   The demand is constant over time. No shortages are allowed. Thus, the production rate is greater than the demand.  The manufacturer offers a permissible period (interest-free period) to the retailer to settle its balance.  The retailer is not allowed to have more than one outstanding balance at a time and is able to settle the balance in a single payment.   The retailer invests its balance (Cr*Q) during the delay period. The number of trucks of identical capacity, fuel consumption and emissions with the manufacturer is unlimited and there will not be any change in fuel consumption and emissions over time and due to the change in drivers.    All the trucks will always use the same path. Manufacturing emissions will remain constant over time. All the costs including the rate of financial cost of holding will remain constant.  The following notations have been used to develop the mathematical models: 120

6.3 Mathematical model 6.3.1 Hill's model with transport cost and the costs of emissions
Hill (1997) proposed a production policy that allows shipments to be delivered to the retailer during the production segment of a manufacturer's cycle, with the first shipment reducing the manufacturer's inventory level to zero. The inventory behavior of Hill's model is illustrated in Figure 6.1.

For the details on expression for transport cost (0 and 1 ) and the cost of transport emissions ( = 2        ), refer to Gurtu et al., (2015). The assumption that an entire shipment-lot is sent in a truck has 122

been relaxed and additional parameter  has been added to show the number of trucks per shipment, where  = / . Therefore,  is considered as a decision variable for minimizing total cost and emissions subject to the constraint that  is an integer and  -   0 (Bazan et al., 2015).

6.3.2 Hill's model with permissible delay in payments, transport and emissions costs
This section takes the modified model of the previous section and incorporates delays-in-payments. There are three cases to be considered: (i) the payment is made on the last day of the delay period, (ii) the payment is made after the permissible delay period, but before receiving the next lot, (iii) the payment is made after receiving the next lot. 6.3.2.1. Case I where 0   =    The retailer annual cost, which includes the costs of ordering, purchasing, holding (financial + storage), transportation and emissions less the capital gain (or loss) is written as

6.4 Numerical examples
The input data for numerical examples has been taken from different papers. Permissible delay and interest cost variables have been taken from Aljazzar et al. (2016), fuel consumption and transport emissions data have been taken from Gurtu et al. (2015) and manufacturing emissions data have been taken from Jaber et al. (2013). The values of the input parameters are:

D = 1000 units per year  = $ 15 per unit  = 0.1%  = $ 4 per unit per year a = 0.0000003 d = 500 Km

P = 3200 units per year  = $ 3 per unit per year  = $ 30 per order  = $ 12 per unit per year b = 0.0012 Truck capacity = 80 units.

 = $ 200 per order  = $ 9 per unit per year  = $ 20 per unit  = 0.2 % c = 1.4  = $ 30 per Ton of CO2

The distance between the vendor and the buyer has been taken as 500 km from Gurtu et al. (2015), which is very close to the distances, 300 miles, used by Bazan et al. (2015). The values of the order cost, number of shipments per

128

production cycle, lot size, transport and emissions costs for ten ( = 10) production cycles were calculated. These costs are based on the assumption that the first order is placed on Jan 1, 2016, for one-way travel distance () of 500 km taking fuel consumption ( ) as 0.3 Lt/km. The retailer's cost is increasing because of fuel cost and hence transportation cost increases with every cycle. For the 10 runs, = 2,  = 3, and  = 222 remain unchanged, the average supply chain cost is $ 60,340. These results can be clearly observed from the mathematics as n only affects the cost of fuel. The results of Hill's (1997) policy without fuel and emissions costs, with fuel cost and emissions costs, and with delay-in-payments in addition to fuel and emissions costs for the three cases, i.e. 0   =    , 0   <    and 0     <  have been summarized in Table 6.1. Since the fuel cost increases over time, the values in Table 6.1 are the averages of 10 consecutive cycles.

129

The reason for relatively smaller values of the total cost in the first 4 rows as compared to the last 4 rows of Table 6.1 is that the costs in the first 4 rows are without the costs of fuel and emissions. Therefore, comparison of costs in Table 6.1 should be limited to the top 4 rows to see the impact of delays-in-payments without fuel and emissions costs and to the bottom 4 rows for delays-inpayments when fuel and emissions costs are included. It is important to mention that the least emissions are for Cases I and II, which are discussed in detail in the next section in the managerial insights. The production rate in the numerical example was set at 3200 units per year, which has been taken from previously referred works. However, it is not the most optimal production rate under all the cases discussed in this chapter. This has been explained later in this chapter by making the production rate a decision variable to find the least total cost as well as the carbon footprint for each of the cases. The results are given in Table 6.2.

Next, the sensitivity analyses on important parameters were performed. The sensitivity for the ratio of demand and production, the ratio of holding costs, changes in carbon tax rate, and changes in fuel cost were performed. The 130

sensitivity analyses for changes in the rates of carbon tax and in the prices of fuel resulted in a linear increase in the total cost for all the cases, i.e. these increases in total system cost are directly proportional to the increase in the rate of carbon tax as well as to the increases in the price of fuel. The next section analyzes and discusses these results.

6.5 Analysis and discussion
Permissible delay-in-payments leads to a larger shipment lot which reduces the number of orders/setups/truck trips per year of a supply chain (Table 6.1). A reduction in the number of truck trips per year reduces emissions and costs from the supply chain. The reduction in the number of trucks is due to an increase in utilization of the truck capacity. The results in Table 6.1 show that total system cost for all scenarios of delays-in-payments is less than the cost when it is not offered to the buyer by the vendor. Scenario 3, Table 6.1, (0     < ) provides the least system cost of the three scenarios. Although Case III is the most economical, it is not practical. It is further discussed in the next section. The delay in a payment in some extreme cases is limited to 180 days in the industry. Therefore, the more practical cases of delays-in-payments are Case I and II, which improve the economic and environmental performance. The focus was on transport emissions due to changes in the lot sizes because manufacturing emissions are unaffected by delays-in-payments. This model did not consider emissions from transportation of perishable goods such as milk 131

products, fruits and vegetables and their storage, which may affect the environmental performance of a supply chain. The reduction in the transport emissions is almost the same for Case I and II, but the reduction in cost is the highest for Case II (Table 6.1). It is worth mentioning that emissions and the total cost are functions of a combination of the number of trucks and shipment lot size. A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the effects of varying some parameters in the total cost of the supply chain. The sensitivity analysis indicated that supply chain cost is sensitive to the ratio of demand and production capacity, which were varied from 0.1 to 1. The total cost of a supply chain first reduces as this ratio increases and then the cost starts increasing steadily in the shape of an upward parabola. Therefore, the total cost function is a convex function. The optimal point is achieved when the ratio is 0.5 or 50%, i.e. the production capacity is double that of the annual demand. This was further tested for Case II and III. The pattern is the same for all the cases, i.e. it is a convex function in each of the cases. Similarly, the ratio of holding costs was varied from 0.25 to 2.0 in steps of 0.25 for each of the policies and the results were linear. Further, emissions tax rate was varied from $30 to $50 in steps of $5 for all the three cases to see its effect on the total cost of the purchase order. The curves showed a linear behavior. Similarly, sensitivity to fuel cost and its impact on the total cost was analyzed for an increase in fuel prices from 5% to 25% in steps of 5% for the 3 cases. The result showed a linear

132

behavior. The next section discusses conclusions, limitations, and potential further research.

6.6 Managerial insights
There are some practical applications of this work. The first and the most important takeaway is that permissible delay-in-payments can be used as a strategic tool to reduce the total cost of coordinated supply chains even when the fuel costs and costs of emissions from transportation and manufacturing, are considered. The savings generated due to delay-in-payments can be invested to improve the environmental performance and/or to fund social and community programs. The savings reinvested into existing operations to improve technologies, systems, processes or the efficiency of machines to make them green will improve the environmental performance of a supply chain. The savings can be deployed into the research and development of environmentally friendly material and packaging, which will further reduce the carbon footprint while reducing the system cost. There are several methods of reducing the carbon footprint. However, the carbon sequestration through trees is perhaps the oldest, the most prominent and an effective method of reducing the carbon footprint (Ahi & Searcy, 2014; Ferrão et al., 2014; Kula & Gunalay, 2012; Pearson, Brown, Sohngen, Henman, & Ohrel, 2014; Rossi et al., 2015; van der Ploeg & Withagen, 2012). The cost of carbon sequestration through plantation is a relatively low cost to mitigate climate 133

change (Pearson et al., 2014). The savings can be deployed towards planting trees in communities to reduce the impact of emissions on environment and societies. The social aspects of supply chains are becoming increasingly important (Hutchins & Sutherland, 2008; Mani, Agrawal, & Sharma, 2015; Seuring, Yawar, & Seuring, 2015). Reinvesting savings or parts thereof to build skill development centers, libraries, recreation centers or community parks will improve the social responsibility in communities. The next important takeaway for practitioners is that they can optimize either on the production volume, the length of the delay period or the lot size and it will minimize the total cost of supply chains. These three neither compete nor contradict each other.

It is clear from the figure that the length of the delay in payment has a direct impact on the cost of a supply chain when considering the environmental factors such as the cost of fuel and emissions. The takeaway from this is of particular interest to professionals. The overall cost of the supply chain system can be reduced by adjusting both the production rate and the delay period simultaneously. On optimizing all three parameters, the least cost of emissions for the numerical example is $6,290. It is important to mention that the period of a trade credit is usually a rounded off number such as 30, 60 or 90 days. However, the graph in Figure 6.2 shows that an increase of 4 days in trade credit from 86 to 90 results in an increase of about $1,200 in emissions cost and $2200 in the total cost (including additional emission cost), which is an increase of about 5% of the total cost $46,512. This can be used as an incentive in negotiations, e.g. a price discount at the rate of 1% per day for settling the payment earlier than 90 days up to a maximum of 4% will benefit the manufacturer by about 1% in additional savings. A delay in payment lowers the system's cost because it is assumed that the money equivalent to the payment is invested in an instrument which yields a higher rate of return than the interest charged by the manufacturer. Also, the manufacturer prefers to move more units to the buyer's side to save on storage cost or to free space, which is usually costly. In the first case, no interest is charged but that does not mean the money was available to the buyer for free. The cost of financing a lot for a couple of weeks at the buyer's end is required

135

due to the processing time of payment in an organization and is built into the pricing decision. Figure 6.2 shows that the economic performance is the best where the emissions are at their lowest level, which is a win-win situation. However, there may be challenges in negotiating the terms with a supplier for delaying the payment for about 2.5~3 months. The period is longer in this case for the input parameters used and may be less in some cases and more for others. Using a different set of parameters will provide a different value for the delay period. Hovelaque and Bironneau, (2015) have discussed the idea of altering demand based on carbon pricing. It may be possible to alter the model discussed here based on price discounts from saving in cost due to delays-in-payments. Further explorations on these lines have been left as a possible extension to this work. The model used all trucks of a fixed maximum capacity and therefore when optimizing the lot size shipment, one gets a lot size shipment that requires either an exact number of trucks or one of the trucks being very close to full when more than one trucks is required. As an example, the last row in Table 6.1 needs 5 trucks for a lot size of 385. This means that the lot will need 4 full trucks and the last truck will utilize about 81% of its capacity or all trucks will operate at about 96% utilization, which is very high utilization. It is known from the EOQ model that the impact on the total cost near the optimal point is almost flat. Therefore, in practice, one can choose to increase the lot size shipment to 400, i.e. five full truckloads, thereby further reducing the carbon footprint and improving the environmental performance of the supply chain. This will further 136

reduce the total cost where holding cost at the buyer's end is less than the holding cost at the manufacturer's end. Case III is workable only in cases where delay-in-payments is limited to a couple of weeks. Where a manufacturer has given a longer delay period, e.g., 90 or 180 days, delaying a payment beyond this period will have serious consequences in the credit rating of the organizations and the manufacturer may not like to extend that credit in the future, or may increase the rate of interest substantially. The cases of different rates of interests based on variable delay periods have not been discussed in this chapter. The next section will conclude the chapter and provide some possible extensions of this work. While a permissible delay in payments improves the economic and the environmental performance of a supply chain, it is important to choose the best case under which permissible delay in payments is offered. This decision depends on different factors such as what are the economic and environmental benefits and what is the payback period for choosing a case? Table 6.3 shows the economic and environmental improvements for each case of delay in payments as compared to the base model (with FTM but without delay in payments). Based on the results, it is clear that the Case III provides the best economic performance but it is not a practical case beside it provides the least environmental improvements. From the remaining two cases, Case II provides the best combination of environmental and economic performance, i.e. savings per unit emissions saved is the highest for Case II ($1255 per ton) as compared to Case I ($481 per ton). 137

6.7 Conclusions
The purpose of this chapter is to analyze the combined effects of fuel cost, emissions costs and various scenarios for delay-in-payments in a two-level coordinated supply chain. This chapter modified the model of Hill (1997) to include the fuel cost, the costs of emissions from transport and manufacturing and the permissible delay-in-payments, and developed three new models one for each scenario of delay-in-payments. The main contributions of this chapter are the modified models for a two-level-coordinated supply chain and the findings from numerical examples and sensitivity analyses which showed that the delaysin-payments improve both environmental and economic performance of a supply chain. A vast majority of organizations release the payments after some delay from the time of receiving the goods in practice. This model will be very useful to supply chain practitioners in finding the optimal lot size and the period to delay payments so that the supply chain costs, as well as environmental impact, are minimal.

138

One of the major limitations of this work is the use of one set of data, as results will vary due to the changes in the input parameters. However, the result will be directionally the same. This research can be further extended by studying the effects of delays in payment in a three level supply chains with and without manufacturing and transport emissions. It can also be extended to include the quality rejections and/or breakage in transit. This research can be extended to study its suitability in perishable goods and items requiring refrigerated transportation. This study can also be extended by relaxing the assumption on the capacity and the number of trucks, and by accounting for trucks of varying capacities including the possibility of using a third party for transportation. The models provided in this chapter can also be extended with stepped interest rates based on the delays in payment, using a cap and trade mechanism for emissions, and using price discounts to alter the demand for minimizing the carbon footprint of a supply chain.

CHAPTER 7 : Summary and Conclusion

140

Supply chain management (SCM) has been the center of attention for researchers and businesses. SCM is considered one of the most useful management practices for industries to increase their profitability and competitiveness. The most popular tool of supply chains is the Joint Economic Lot-Size (JELS). JELS benefits the whole supply chain rather than benefiting an individual player. JELS reduces (increases) of the total cost (profit) of the supply chain. Permissible delay in payments is one of the most commonly practiced trade credit incentives by businesses to achieve supply chain cooperation. This thesis developed supply chain models with delay in payments that fill some gaps in the JELS literature. Those gaps are discussed in Chapter 2 of the thesis.

7.1 Contributions and main findings
The first contribution of this thesis was to modify and investigate a two-level (manufacturer-retailer) JELS based supply chain to include delay in payments, where the length of a delay is a decision variable. The three known models are of different production and shipping policies, Goyal (1988), Hill (1997) and Jaber et al. (2010). Each modified model was investigated for three cases. Case I occurs when the retailer settles its owing balance to the manufacturer by the end of the permissible period (no interest charges). Case II occurs when the retailer settles its owing balance after the permissible delay period, but before receiving the next shipment. Case III occurs when the retailer settles its owing balance after receiving the next shipment (eventually past the delay period). The results 141

showed that the best production policy to be adopted by the manufacturer is that of Hill (1997). The results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed the superiority of Hill's policy over those of Goyal (1985) and Jaber et al. (2010) for these reasons. First, by adopting Hill's policy the system achieved the least total cost for the whole supply chain. Second, Hill's production policy provided a range of flexibility when varying the ratio of the demand over the production rates as well as when varying the financial holding costs. The second contribution of this thesis was to present a coordination model for a three-level supply chain (supplier-manufacturer-retailer) with the permissible delay in payments as a decision variable. The supplier offers a permissible delay in payments to the manufacturer who in turn, offers the retailer a permissible delay. Nine different possible scenarios were considered that occur in real life when a permissible delay in payments is adopted. Ten thousand numerical examples were generated to compare between all scenarios besides a scenario when a delay in payments is not offered between the players. A numerical example was selected randomly to illustrate the behavior of each scenario. The results of this numerical example showed that the best scenario that provides with the minimal total cost for the supply chain was scenario II-I. Then, a regression analysis for the simulation run was performed to identify all input parameters that have a significant effect on each scenario. The input parameters that do not have a significant effect were ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  and  . In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed to test the limitations of the nine scenarios. This contribution concluded that the best scenario that 142

provided the least minimum cost was scenario II-I for a couple of reasons. First, scenario II-I achieved the best minimal total cost in 70% of the simulation run. Second, this scenario helps the manufacturer in managing its financial flow, as the manufacturer would first receive the payment from the retailer and then pay the supplier. Third, although the total cost difference between all scenarios is small, it is better to execute a single scenario instead of alternating between multiple scenarios, which could cost more effort and time; a positive result could be achieved by getting all players in the chain to agree upon the scenario II-I. The third contribution involved the development of a model that integrated two coordination mechanisms for a three-level supply chain involving the same players as above. The mechanisms involved were delay in payments along with price discounts. The same nine scenarios as presented in the second contribution, along with eight cases of applicable price discounts between players, were integrated and tested in the following manner: multiple numerical examples were run, with the highest increase in profit being generated by the delay in payment scenario I-II under price discount scenario (0, 0, 1 ­ discount offered by retailer only). Adopting this scenario will result in an increase of the profit of about 10.3 %. This was extended further by use of two sensitivity analyses. In the first analysis, customer elasticity to price discount was varied, resulting in the highest profit for the scenario with the combination I-II to (1, 0, 1). The second analysis tested a variation in rate of return for each player, resulting in the highest total supply chain profit for the combination I-II to (0, 0, 1). The conclusion for the study and its primary contribution to the JELS 143

literature is that integrating the delay in payment mechanism with the price discount mechanism results in a coordination strategy that results in a greater profit than the application of each method separately. In addition, the combination of scenario I-II to (1, 0, 1) was selected as the best solution, first for its achieving the highest profit when varying the customers' elasticity to discounts along with the interest accrued in payment delay, and second for its having the highest flexibility when varying the interest rate and the customers' elasticity to discounts. The integration of these two mechanisms also opens up several paths to further research, with several factors that can be varied and tested to further improve profit in the supply chain. The fourth contribution made in this thesis involved the development of some extension models to the cases initially studied in the two-level supply chain presented in the first contribution. Utilizing the author's model modification of Hill (1997) to include the fuel cost, the costs of emissions from transport and manufacturing and the permissible delay-in-payments, three new models were developed one for each scenario of delay-in-payments. The numerical examples and sensitivity analyses showed that the delays-in-payments improve both environmental and economic performance of a supply chain. A vast majority of organizations release the payments after some delay from the time of receiving the goods in practice. This model will be very useful to managers in finding the optimal lot size and the period to delay payments so that the supply chain costs, as well as environmental impact, are minimal. It further creates research

144

opportunities by presenting a roadmap to integrate real-world extraneous cost scenarios into supply chain coordination.

7.2 Future extensions
The models that were developed in this thesis can be expanded in different possible directions. For instance, when analyzing the first model, the demand rate is stochastic and/or seasonal. Also, analyzing the models under the first contribution by including a logistics costs and capacitated trucks would result in an interesting topic to pursue. Moreover, the models under the second contribution can be extended to account for multiple un-identical retailers and suppliers. Also, they can be extended by analyzing the behavior of permissible delay in payments when considering imperfect items and a return policy. A possible extension for the presented models is by investigating the permissible delay in payments when having multiple products. The models for the third contribution can be extended by incorporating a fixed delay in payment across the supply chain, as is the current practice in several successful supply chains, and compare it with results in this contribution, in order to present guidance, better understanding, and better decision-making for businesses. The models that have been developed from the fourth contribution can be extended to include the quality rejections and/or breakage in transit. Also, they can be extended to study its suitability in the transportation of perishable goods and items requiring refrigeration. These models can also be extended by relaxing the assumption on the capacity and the number of trucks and assuming the trucks 145

of varying capacities (different truck sizes) including the possibility of using a third party for transportation. In addition, it would be interesting to extend those models to account for different methods of transportation options such as by air, sea or land. Also, they can be extended with stepped interest rates based on

the delays in payment, using a cap and trade mechanism for emissions and using price discounts to alter the demand for minimizing the carbon footprint of a supply chain.

Figure C1: Illustration of the effect of different delay in payments' scenario

Figure C1 illustrates the behavior of the inventory of the raw material at the manufacturer's side. The figure is presenting the following scenarios II-I, II-II, IIIII, where the manufacturer's settles its balance with the supplier beyond the permitted period ( ) and before receiving the next shipment, which can be presented mathematically as follows:    <  
  

. However, this scenario does

not show the real practiced, i.e. the manufacturer settles its balance by the end of the permissible period ( =  ) or the manufacturer settles its balance beyond
  the permissible period and after receiving the next shipment (       ). In  

any of the previous scenarios the manufacturer will incurs the financial holding cost for the raw materials after the full payment is made. Similarly, this chapter considered possible different delay in payments' scenarios between the manufacturer and the retailer. 159

Appendix D: Observations on "A Joint Economic-Lot-Size Model for Purchaser and Vendor"

Abstract One of the supply chain coordination methods that has been central to the literature is the joint economic lot-sizing (JELS) problems. The JELS methods have shown to reduce the total cost of a supply chain system. This chapter revisits the work of Goyal (1988), one of the earliest papers on JELS, where the vendor produces an integer multiplier of equal size shipment lots for a buyer and provides three observations on that. Subsequently, two new models have been developed based on the second and third observations. This chapter provided numerical examples and sensitivity analyses to illustrate the similarities and differences among all models. The supply chain performance improves with alternate models for a wider range of attributes, while Goyal's model provides better results for the specific example.

Keywords: Coordination in supply chains, Joint economic lot-size problem, production policy.

D.1 Introduction Supply chain management (SCM) integrates many functions of organizations working together to deliver finished products or services to their end customers. SCM helps in reducing a chain's costs and satisfying customer needs. Thus, it helps in improving the profitability of an organization. Different tools and mechanisms have been developed to enhance coordination and collaboration between parties in a supply chain to reduce the total cost of the system (Aljazzar, Jaber, & Goyal, 2016; Bouslah, Gharbi, & Pellerin, 2016; M.Y. Jaber & Osman, 2006; Khan, Jaber, & Ahmad, 2014; Sawik, 2016). One coordination mechanism that has received the most attention by researchers is the Joint Economic Lots Size (JELS) problem. The JELS was first introduced by Goyal (1977), who proposed a simple model for a two-players system (a vendor and a buyer) with the objective of reducing the combined cost of the system, where the vendor is a supplier (manufacturer) who replenishes buyer's inventory instantaneously, i.e. lead time is zero, assuming an infinite production rate. Banerjee (1986a) extended the work of Goyal (1977) for a single vendor ­ single buyer system by assuming a finite production rate with lot-for-lot policy between the vendor and the buyer. Goyal (1988) relaxed the lot-for-lot assumption of Banerjee (1986a) and assumed that the vendor produces an integer multiplier of the shipment quantity, and sends equal sized shipments to the buyer from the produced inventory. However, it is possible that the production cycle-time for a vendor is either longer/shorter than or equal to the buyer's cycle-time. Therefore, this chapter investigates the effect of these three cases on the joint production161

inventory policy and compares the results with that of the work of Goyal (1988). The objective of this work is to provide an explanation of relationships between production and consumption cycles times in Goyal's work.

The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. Section D.2 is for notations and assumptions. Section D.3 gives an overview of Goyal's (1988) model. Section D.4 provides observations on the work of Goyal's (1988) and modifies it to consider the cases when the vendor's production time is smaller or larger than the buyer's cycle-time. Section D.5 provides numerical examples and sensitivity analyses followed by the conclusions in Section D.6.

D.2 Notations and assumptions The following notations have been used in this chapter: i Ai Ci P D n r hi Q Corresponds to the players, i.e. i = v for vendor and i = b for buyer Setup or order cost for player i Product cost per unit for player i Annual production Annual demand Number of shipments from a production lot Annual inventory carrying cost % per year Unit holding cost per unit per unit time for player i (hi ,= rCi ) Order quantity

Common assumptions that are considered to derive all models are as follows: The vendor ships to the buyer in equal lot sizes. Production rate (P) is greater than demand rate (D). Annual demand and production rates are deterministic and constant over time. Shortages are not allowed. Deliveries are instantaneous.

D.3 Overview of Goyal's model Goyal (1988) assumed that n shipments of size Q each are shipped/delivered to the buyer from one production lot by the vendor. In the case of Banerjee (1986b) n =1, i.e. entire volume from a production cycle is shipped to the buyer in a single lot. Based on the assumptions and the mathematics of Goyal (1988), no deliveries occur during the production, nQ/P, which could be (i) equal to, (ii) larger than or (iii) shorter than the consumption cycle-time (Q/D) of a shipment lot. The accumulated inventory in a production cycle-time is nQ. In Goyal's

163

model, there are too many possibilities to when the vendor may start a production lot of nQ units. This point is further explained later in this chapter.

The hierarchy of three possibilities of the inventory behavior of Goyal (1988), discussed above, and the two extreme variants of the possibilities where the production cycle-time is shorter or longer than the consumption cycle-time for a shipment lot are summarized in figure D.1.

Goyal's inventory Model

Production cycletime (nQ/P) < Consumption cycletime (Q/D)

Production cycletime (nQ/P) = Consumption cycletime (Q/D)

Production cycletime (nQ/P) > Consumption cycletime (Q/D)

Production cycle finishes just when the 1st lot is to be shipped

Production cycle start as soon as last lot is delivered

Production cycle start beofore the dispatch of the last lot is delivered

Production starts immediately after delivering the last shipment & shipment frequency < consumption cycle

Figure D.1: Summary of possible inventory behaviors of Goyal's model

The behavior of inventories as described in the mathematics of Goyal (1988) has the following possibilities

from the top in Figure D.2, respectively. The bottom curve is for inventory behavior at the buyer's end for the three possibilities at the vendor's end. 164

When the production cycle-time is less than the time it takes to consume the inventory of a shipment lot, i.e.
 

< , there are several possibilities of starting



or finishing point. One of the extreme positions is where the production cycle end at the point of dispatch (or the point of delivery because of instantaneous delivery). The other extreme position is where the production starts as soon as the last (nth) shipment is dispatched. The first extreme position is illustrated as the second curve from the top in Figures D.2 and the second extreme position is illustrated in Figure D.3. Its effects are discussed in the next section.

The case when the production cycle-time is longer than the consumption cycletime of a shipment lot,
 

> , also has many possibilities for starting a



production cycle. To avoid shortages, the vendor can start the next production run at any point such that it is less than  ( - ) and greater than Q/D, allowing an overlap between the current and the next cycles as shown in the third curve from the top of Figure D.2. Another scenario is to dispatch larger batches of equal sizes to the buyer so that the inventory builds at the buyer's end. The inventory behaviors of shipping larger batches of equal sizes are shown in Figure D.4.

According to Goyal's (1988) model, the vendor's total annual cost given by Eq. (D.1) and is the sum of set-up (first term) and holding (second term) costs  =
  

+ 

  2

{  (1 +  ) - 1}



(D.1)

The buyer's total annual cost is equal to  =   +  2
 

(D.2)

The total annual cost for the system is the sum of Eq. (D.1) and Eq. (D.2) and is written as 0 = (  +  )  + 2 [ {  (1 +  ) - 1} +  ]
   

(D.3)

167

where the subscript `0' represents Goyal's base model. The optimal joint order quantity for Goyal (1988) is obtained by differentiating Eq. (D.3) with respect to Q and solving it to get
 0 =
 2(  + )   

[ { (1+ )-1}+ ]

(D.4)

 Substituting 0 from Ea. (D.4) in Eq. (D.3) reduces it to

0 = 2 (  +  ) [ {  (1 +  ) - 1} +  ]





(D.5)

D.4 Observations This section provides three observations on the model of Goyal (1988). The second and third observations led us to develop two alternative models. D.4.1 First observation: For the first case, where the production cycle-time (nQ/P) and the buyer's cycletime (Q/D) are the same, i.e. nD =P as shown in the top curve in Figure D.2, the optimal order quantity represented by Eq. (D.4) and the total system cost function represented by Eq. (D.5) reduce to
 1 =  (
 2(  + )   + )

(D.6)

 = 2 (  +  ) ( +  )



(D.7)

This is a special case of Goyal's model where shipment lot size and total system cost functions are independent of production rate.

168

D.4.2 Second observation (first alternative model): The case when the production cycle-time is less than the consumption cycletime, it is illustrated in the second curve from the top in Figures 2 and the curve in Figure D.3. The difference in these cycle-times is given by t 

Q nQ  , which D P

can be used to delay the start time of the next production cycle, as shown in the second curve from the top in Figure D.2. The behavior of Goyal's (1988) model, for all the cases described in Figure D.2, is identical from the mathematical point of view as discussed in the previous section (see Eq. (D.1) to (D.5)). However, for the case shown in Figure D.3, a vendor starts production of the next batch of nQ units in a time less than the difference in cycle-time t after dispatching the nth shipment, there will be an additional holding cost for the vendor. The extreme position occurs when a vendor starts the production immediately after delivering the last shipment as shown in Figure D.3. In this case, there will be an additional cost of holding inventory (nQ) for the time t  inventory for a vendor will be Vendor's inventory =
2  2 2

Q nQ  . Therefore, the total D P

+

 2 (-1) 2

+

 2  

(1 -

 

)

(D.8)

Average inventory holding cost of the vendor is obtained by dividing Eq. (D.8) by the total cycle-time of the buyer nQ/D and multiplying by hv as follows  =
  2

{  (1 -  ) + 1}



(D.9)

Therefore, vendor's total cost changes to 1 =
  

+

  2

{  (1 -  ) + 1} 169



(D.10)

The buyer's total annual cost is given by Eq. (D.2). Therefore, the total annual cost of the system for the first alternative model (TC1) is given by the summation of Eq. (D.2) and Eq. (D.10) as 1 = (  +  )  + 2 [ {  (1 -  ) + 1} +  ]
   

(D.11)

TC1 can be easily shown to be a convex function of Q. The optimal order quantity for the system is
 2

=

 2(  + )   

[ { (1- )+1}+ ]

(D.12)

 Substituting 2 in Eq. (C.11) will change the total cost function to

1 = 2 (  +  ) [ {  (1 -  ) + 1} +  ]





(D.13)

D.4.3 Third observation (second alternative model) One possible scenario that was not discussed in Goyal (1988) is that the vendor's production cycle time could be longer than the lot consumption cycle-time. The optimal equal shipment lot size (Q) is given by Eq. (D.4) and the inventory behaviors for vendor and buyer are shown in Figure D.2. However, the vendor could send shipments of equal sizes which are large than the optimal shipment lot size to avoid shortages at the buyer's end. Accordingly, the behavior of the inventories at buyer's and vendor's ends are illustrated in Figure D.4. Therefore, the inventory holding cost for the vendor will be as follows 2 = 
 2

(D.14)

The buyer's inventory holding cost will change as follows 170

2 = 

 2

(D.15)

Refer Appendix D-1 for the details of the derivation of Eq. (D.14) and (D.15). Therefore, the annual total cost for this supply chain system is as following 3 = (  +  )  + 
   2

+ 

 2

(D.16)

Eq. (D.16) is convex function since the second derivative with respect to Q is positive for every Q (i.e. 2 (  +  ) 3 > 0Q > 0), whose optimal solution is
 3 =
 2(  + ) 





( + )

 

(D.17)

Replacing the value of Q from Eq. (D.17) in Eq. (D.16) gets 3 = 2 (  +  ) ( +   )
 

(D.18)

D.5 Numerical examples In this section, numerical examples are provided to compare between all the models presented in this chapter. All input parameters in the numerical example were adopted from Goyal (1988). The numerical examples exclude the item cost at vendor's and buyer's ends as was the case with Goyal (1988). Accordingly, the input parameters used for the numerical examples are as follows:
D = 1000 units per year Av = $ 400 per setup r =20% P = 3200 units per year Cb = $25 per unit Ab = $25 per order Cv= $ 20 per unit

171

However, different values for the rate of production (P) have been used to satisfy each of the cases because the value of P = 3200 satisfies only one of the scenarios discussed above.

D.5.1 Observation 1 The comparison of results for the first observation with Goyal's model, when P=2000, are identical as illustrated in Table D.1. Further, varying the ratio of order cost and set-up, and the ratio of holding costs have almost linear effects on the total cost and identical for both the models, as shown in Figures D.5 and D.6.

D.5.2 Observation 2 The comparison of results for the second observation, i.e. nD < P, with P=3200, show that vendors' cost increased and buyer's cost reduced with the use of the alternate model as compared to the Goyal's model. The vendor's cost increases due to holding the products in the inventory for a longer period (additional holding cost) and the buyer's cost reduces due to a reduction in the lot size, which will lead to lower holding cost for the buyer. The resultant total cost for the Goyal's model is lower the modified model as illustrated in Table D.2.

Analysis of the ratio of the demand to the rate of production shows an interesting behavior where the total cost for the alternate function reduces when this ratio increases beyond 0.3 (Figure D.7). Further, for all ratios of order and set-up costs, Goyal's model provides least total cost (Figure D.8). However, the analysis of the ratio of holding costs shows better results for Goyal's model so long as this ratio is less than 1.75. After this point, the alternate model starts providing lower system cost (Figure D.9).

D.5.3 Observation 3 The comparison of results for the third observation, i.e. nD > P, with P=1500 showed that vendor's cost increased and buyer's cost reduced with the use of the alternate model as compared to the Goyal's model. The reason for this behavior is the same as explained in Sub-Section D.5.2. The resultant total cost for the Goyal's model is lower than the modified model as illustrated in Table D.3.

Analysis of the ratio of the demand to the rate of production shows that the behavior of Goyal's model provides the least total cost for the system for a wide range between 0.1 and 0.9, as illustrated in Figure D.10. Further, for all the ratios of order and set-up costs, both the models exhibit a very similar behavior (Figure D.11). However, the analysis of the ratio of holding costs is better for the alternate model so long as this ratio is less than 1, same at 1 and better for Goyal's model becomes better when the ratio is greater than 1 (Figure D.12).

D.6 Discussion and Conclusions As demonstrated above, Goyal's model has many possible interpretations and each provides a different result based on the interpretation. This chapter

178

provided a summary of all the possible interpretations of the seminal work on JELS by Goyal (1988). The contribution of this chapter is the presentation of various possibilities of the starting points for a production cycle under Goyal's policy. Three of these observations led to the development of two alternate models. The behavior of Goyal's (1988) model in the cases described in Figure D.2 is mathematically identical as discussed in the previous section. The results for the numerical examples using Goyal's input provide slightly better results for Goyal's model as compared to the alternate models. However, all these cases are special cases where data were taken from Goyal's example for the purpose of comparing the results between Goyal's and the alternate models. A closer look at the sensitivities to other parameters, the suggested observations provide a better performance for a wider range and will be useful to practitioners in making a business decision. As an example to this point, when nD < P and the ratio of demand to production (D/P) is greater than 0.3, alternate model provides better performance for the total cost of a supply chain. However, Goyal's model is better when this ratio is less than 0.3 as shown in Figure D.7 and both are the same when the ratio is 0.3.

In addition, the sensitivity analysis showed that when varying the buyer's holding cost over the vendor holding cost ( / ), the model under Observation 2 provides better results when the ratio is greater than 1.75. When this ratio is 1.75, both the models provide the same result. However, under Observation 3,

179

alternate model provides better results when the ratio of holding costs is less than 1.

This work can be extending by investigating the effects adding transport cost, and transport and manufacturing emissions. Another possible extension is to include multiple vendors and/or multiple buyers in the system. Another possible extension is to analyze the effects of the transportation costs if it is charged by using capacitated trucks. Another possible extension is to compare it with the consignment policy (Braglia & Zavanella, 2003) where the buyer's holding cost is less than vendor's holding cost.
