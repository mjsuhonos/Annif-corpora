ABSTRACT

This paper provides a profile of newcomer services and the agencies which provide them to recent immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). It is intended as a resource for researchers, immigrants, agency, community and government organizations. The paper begins by reviewing: the range of newcomer services available, trends in recent immigrant settlement in the Toronto area, and a description of funding sources for newcomer services in the GTA. Next we discuss our research methodology and identify some limitations to the material we present. The bulk of the paper consists of an identification of agencies providing newcomer services in the City of Toronto and Regional Municipalities of Durham, Halton, Peel and York. We cite location, funding source(s), and program offering(s) for each agency. The paper concludes with tabulated summaries of the agencies described.

KEY WORDS: newcomer services; immigrant service agencies; Toronto immigration settlement; newcomer service funding

Page 1 INTRODUCTION

This report aims to provide an overview about the range of newcomer services in the Greater Toronto Area, the service deliverers in the area, and a brief description of some of their sources of funding. The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) consists of four regional municipalities ­ Durham, Halton, Peel, York ­ and the City of Toronto (Figure 1).

Figure 1 This report begins with a description of the range of settlement services available in the GTA. Next is a brief overview of recent immigrant settlement patterns in the GTA, followed by a review of federal and provincial government funding programs for settlement services in the region. At the federal level, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) administers three funding programs: Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC), Immigrant Settlement and Adaptation Program (ISAP), and the Host Program. In Ontario, the Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration disperses funding for settlement services through the Newcomer Settlement Program (NSP). Next, other funding sources such as foundations and the United Way are briefly discussed. Lastly, research methodology, limitations and challenges are addressed. Appendix 1 alphabetically lists settlement service providers, including their branches, in the City of Toronto. In the same manner, Appendices 2 through 5 list settlement services for Durham Region, Halton Region, Peel Region and York Region, respectively.

Page 2 All contents of this report were collected via online sources, and augmented through the use of a few individual contacts. Only information about funding programs and settlement service providers that was accessible from the Internet is included in this report. Therefore, this report does not claim to be exhaustive in its presentation of information concerning settlement services and funding in the GTA. Nor is this report an analysis of the state of the immigrant settlement sector in the Toronto area. Our goal here is rather to provide an accessible profile of this critical sector.

THE RANGE OF NEWCOMER SERVICES IN THE GREATER TORONTO AREA

The range of settlement-related needs can be quite broad especially when individualized needs are taken in account. The following issues have been identified as the most common needs: · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Advocacy, Counselling and support, Education, Emergency food services, Employment, English as a second language (ESL), Form filling, Health/Medical, Housing, Information and referral, Legal, Orientation, Recreation, and Translation and interpretation

Some settlement services are directed towards specific target groups such as youth, women, and seniors. The following tables provide summaries of these specific settlement services and target groups.

IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT IN THE GREATER TORONTO AREA The Toronto city-region has become one of the world's leading urban sites of immigrant settlement. Immigrants comprise over 4 in every 10 residents of the GTA (Table 3). In the City of Toronto, half of all residents are immigrants. As of 2001, across the entire GTA, almost one in every ten residents of the Toronto city-region had immigrated to Canada within the previous 5 years. Clearly, the need for effective, accessible newcomer services in the Toronto city-region is great. Table 3: Immigrants and Recent Immigrants by GTA Municipality, 2001

Page 5 The 1990s set a new record for the numbers of immigrants entering Canada in a single decade. A total of 1.8 million immigrants arrived in that decade, with fully 43% settling in the Toronto city-region (Schellenberg 2004). Fully 79% of all immigrants who arrived in the Toronto area during the 1990s were visible minorities ­ the vast majority from Asia (McIsaac 2003). One distinctive aspect of immigrant settlement in the GTA is its diffusion across different parts of the city-region. Over the past 20 years, newcomer settlement has increased significantly in three distinctive parts of the Toronto area: Toronto's original central city and post-war suburbs of North York and Scarborough (all now amalgamated into the City of Toronto), and the city-region's more recently emergent edge cities (particularly Markham and Vaughan in York Region, Mississauga and Brampton in Peel Region). Settlement services, therefore, have had to respond both to unprecedented numbers of newcomers and a new clustering of immigrant settlement locations ­ particularly in the Regional Municipalities beyond the City of Toronto.

DESCRIPTION OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR NEWCOMER SERVICES IN THE GREATER TORONTO AREA

The following section describes the various funding sources for settlement services in the GTA. These sources include: three federal government programs (LINC, ISAP and Host); the Ontario government's Newcomer Settlement Program (NSP); support from various charitable foundations; the United Way of Greater Toronto; and other funding sources.

Newcomer Programs Funded by the Federal Government

According to the federal government's newcomer programs, a newcomer is someone who has been in Canada for three years or less, is not a Canadian citizen, but is someone to whom Canada intends to grant permanent resident status. Refugee claimants and Canadian citizens do not qualify as newcomers and, therefore, are ineligible for federally-funded settlement services. The federal government supports healthy adaptation and settlement for newcomers through the work of Citizenship and Immigration Canada. Federal funds for settlement services are channeled through three programs: Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC); the Immigrant Settlement and Adaptation Program (ISAP); and the Host program. The following section provides a more detailed overview of the three funding channels provided by the federal government.

Page 6 Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC)

The purpose of the LINC program is to ensure that adult newcomers have access to basic language training in one of Canada's official languages as soon as possible after arrival. Such language instruction is meant to assist them with their integration into Canadian society. Throughout the GTA, many English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) classes are funded by LINC and offered through community agencies, school boards, and community centres. Language training through LINC is offered to newcomers on a part-time or full-time basis, and is available to eligible individuals for up to three years. One of the first steps for newcomers who enrol in a LINC program is to undergo an assessment of their skills in Canada's official languages. The purpose of the assessment is to determine what level of language competency the newcomer possesses so that their subsequent language training can meet their individual needs most appropriately. Assessments are conducted by using the Canadian Language Benchmarks, which are a set of national standards or reference points for ESL programming. Service providers that are eligible to apply for funding through LINC include educational institutions, non-profit organizations, businesses, provincial/territorial or municipal governments, and individuals.

Immigrant Settlement and Adaptation Program (ISAP)

The purpose of ISAP is to fund organizations that act as bridges between newcomers and settlement services in their communities. Projects funded by ISAP are categorized under two streams, A and B. The main difference is that projects in Stream A provide direct services to newcomers, whereas projects in Stream B are indirect services. Under ISAP, Stream A projects provide services that are essential to newcomers' initial settlement needs. Some examples of such services include: · Reception ­ such as the "Welcome to Canada" information kit that newcomers are provided with upon arrival at the port of entry; Referral ­ services that link newcomers with various resources in the community, such as education, recreation and health facilities; Orientation ­ services that assist newcomers in becoming familiar with their community in areas such as public transportation, banking, day care, school registration, shopping, budgeting, food preparation and nutrition; and Interpretation and Translation - interpreters can aid newcomers in the first stages of adjustment when language skills may not yet be refined. Some examples include the interpretation of Canadian culture, symbols, and systems. Translation services

Page 7 are often essential in order to understand documents such as applications and forms that are related to many issues such as education, housing, and employment. Also funded under Stream A in ISAP are pre-departure orientation services in some countries overseas. These services may prepare future newcomers to Canada on what to expect in terms of issues such as culture, food, climate, and the economy. Stream B ISAP funding is only available for regional or national services. Unlike the agencies funded under Stream A of ISAP, Stream B recipients are not direct service deliverers; but rather organizations involved in projects that are committed to improving the widespread delivery of settlement services. More specifically, regional proposals must meet a particular region's settlement-service priorities, and national proposals must meet more than one region's priorities. All Stream B ISAP proposals must show commitment to contributing towards the improvement of the delivery of settlement services in some way. For example, in the past this funding has supported conferences and seminars, publications and newsletters, and research and audiovisuals (Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2003). Organizations that are eligible to apply for ISAP funding are non-profit organizations and educational institutions.

Host Program

The Host program provides funding for organizations to recruit and train Canadian volunteers to help newcomers adapt, settle, and integrate into Canadian life. These volunteers are then matched with newcomers and act as hosts to the newcomers in Canada. The purpose of the Host program is to attempt to alleviate the overwhelming stresses of migration by introducing a Canadian friend to each newcomer soon after their arrival. Host volunteers help newcomers adjust to Canadian life by acting as cultural interpreters, helping with language skills, showing newcomers how to access community services, assisting newcomers in finding employment and overall, supporting newcomers as they learn to participate in their community. Service providers that are eligible to apply for Host funding are businesses, nonprofit organizations, non-governmental organizations, community groups, educational institutions, individuals and provincial/territorial or municipal governments. Further information about LINC, ISAP and HOST can be found at Citizenship and Immigration Canada's website: www.cic.gc.ca.

Page 8 Newcomer Programs Funded by the Government of Ontario

Newcomer Settlement Program (NSP)

According to the Newcomer Settlement Program, a newcomer is someone who has been in Canada for less than five years. Additionally, a newcomer must qualify as one of the following: · Minister's Permit holders whom Canada intends to grant permanent resident status; permanent residents and citizens of Canada; refugees and refugee claimants; OR non-immigrant foreign domestic workers in Canada who may apply for permanent resident status from within Canada under the Live-In Caregiver Program.

· · ·

The purpose of the Newcomer Settlement Program (NSP) is to support the early and effective settlement of newcomers to Ontario. Its main objective is to help newcomers settle, adjust, and contribute to life in Ontario. In order to achieve these ends, the NSP provides funds to support the delivery of settlement services; enhance the ability of the settlement sector to deliver effective services and respond to changing needs; and promote the participation of volunteers in the delivery of settlement services (Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration, 2003). Organizations may apply for funding under the Newcomer Settlement Program in two streams: Direct Settlement Services and Sectoral Support Projects. Both of these streams are organized into two further sub-categories (see Figure 2). Direct Settlement Services refer to services that are offered to both individual newcomers and groups of newcomers. Direct Settlement Services are divided into two subcategories, a) Core Services and b) Facilitate Finding Employment. Settlement services that qualify under Core Services, including information and referral, orientation, and general settlement assistance. As the name suggests, settlement services that qualify for funding under the Facilitate Finding Employment category must be committed to providing in-depth assistance to newcomers in finding employment. This includes job counselling, job training programs, job search strategies, filling out forms, and access to computers.

Sectoral Support Projects refer to services that are committed to enhancing the settlement service sector in some way. Sectoral Support Projects are further divided into two sub-categories, a) Training and Professional Development Assistance for Settlement Workers and b) Sectoral Development Strategies. The first sub-category grants priority in funding to projects that contribute to the greater effectiveness of settlement workers in the following areas: settlement needs assessment, program outcome measurement, group facilitation and presentation, and settlement service standards (Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration, 2003). The second sub-category grants priority in funding to projects that are committed to expanding the overall capacity of the settlement sector and/or supporting the effective settlement of newcomers in the following areas: partnerships and collaborations, development of standards and outcomes, community needs identification, and quality settlement service delivery (Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration, 2003). Organizations eligible to apply for funding through the Newcomer Settlement Program must qualify under the following criteria: · · · · · provide or support as a priority the provision of ongoing settlement services; have provided the above for at least two years; have been incorporated and non-profit for at least two years; design their programs and services for residents of Ontario; have a board of directors that is democratically elected and representative of the communities and organizations that use their services;

Page 10 · have bylaws that outline procedures for reporting and accounting to their membership for the organization's operations and performance; satisfy the ministry that they can receive, handle and account for public funds in a responsible manner; have adequate cash flow management and funds in reserve; and provide evidence that their settlement services and programs have other financial support e.g. corporate contributions, United Way, fund-raising.2

Foundations

The foundations that are most well known in the settlement service sector for their funding of immigrant settlement agencies are the Ontario Trillium Foundation and the Maytree Foundation. These two foundations will be briefly described here.

The Ontario Trillium Foundation

The Ontario Trillium Foundation is an agency affiliated with the Ontario's Ministry of Culture. At present, it receives $100 million of government funding annually. This funding is generated through Ontario's charity casino initiative. The Ontario Trillium Foundation provides funds to organizations that have local and/or province-wide impact related to one or more of the foundation's four sectors. These four sectors are: Arts and Culture; Environment; Human and Social Services; and Sports and Recreation. The Trillium Foundation seeks and encourages grant proposals from organizations that make an effort to collaborate between and link sectors. Additionally, grant applicants are encouraged to join the Trillium Foundation in achieving its three goals of 1) Building healthy communities and strengthening volunteerism; 2) Increasing accessibility and celebrating Ontario's diversity; and 3) Stimulating economic growth and innovation (Trillium Foundation, 2003).3

Further information about the Newcomer Settlement Program can be found at the Ministry of Citizenship's website: www.gov.on.ca/citizenship/english/citdiv/immigrat/newcomer.htm Further information about the Ontario Trillium Foundation can be found at their website www.trilliumfoundation.org.

Page 11 The Maytree Foundation The Maytree Foundation was founded in 1982 as a private Canadian charitable foundation. Maytree is committed to a mandate of both reducing inequality and poverty in Canada and building strong civic communities. These objectives are fulfilled by "identifying, supporting and funding ideas, leaders, and leading organizations that have the capacity to make change and advance the common good" (Maytree Foundation, 2003). The two types of Maytree grants offered to immigrant and refugee-serving organizations are capacity-building grants and solution-seeking grants. Capacity-building grants are available for projects that aim to further the participation of refugees and immigrants in Canadian society and improved governance, to foster more sustainable organizational management, and to increase community responsiveness (Maytree Foundation, 2003). Solution-seeking grants are available for projects that address the interests of refugees and immigrants in at least one of the following: convention refugees in limbo; immigrants and employment; exploration of a stronger municipal role in immigrant settlement; and an increased understanding and awareness of the benefits of immigration in building a stronger Canada (Maytree Foundation, 2003). The Maytree Foundation offers opportunities for grants to registered charities, organizations that have an explicit mandate in advancing the settlement of immigrants and refugees, and lastly, projects in large urban centres with significant populations of immigrants and refugees (Maytree Foundation, 2003).4

The United Way of Greater Toronto

Founded in Toronto in 1918, the United Way of Greater Toronto is an incorporated, non-profit charity that funds a network of 200 social- and health-service agencies in Toronto. The United Way of Greater Toronto's annual fundraising campaign is the largest in Canada. In 2003, the United Way of Greater Toronto fundraising campaign reached an all time high of $84.3 million dollars (United Way, 2004). In January 2003, the United Way announced its commitment of $300,000 to newcomer services in the Greater Toronto Area. The projects that have been awarded this funding are organizations that address the needs of newcomers. This announcement is not their first initiative to help newcomers. United Way has been funding agencies that offer settlement services for many years now.

Page 12 Other Funding Sources

Other funding sources include various bodies at the national, provincial and local levels that contribute financial support to organizations that are committed to newcomer services in the GTA. Government departments such as the Ontario Ministry of Health and Human Resources Development Canada contribute funds through various programs that support settlement services. Also, many agencies and organizations receive funding for settlement services from charities and fundraising initiatives.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

In order to conduct a thorough search for settlement services and their deliverers in the GTA, many avenues were pursued. All information was accessible through the internet. The most comprehensive sources for information about settlement services in the City of Toronto were 211 Toronto (www.211toronto.ca) and Settlement.org (www.settlement.org). Both are very rich sources of information which have been designed for use by both newcomers and settlement service workers. For example, 211 Toronto offers detailed profile listings about organizations and agencies in the City of Toronto that provide settlement services. Settlement.org is a portal partner of 211 Toronto that provides a database of settlement-service deliverers in the GTA. Settlement.org also provides in-depth, on-line information for newcomers and settlement workers regarding many different settlement issues such as housing, education, English language instruction, and health care. It also allows users of the site to search for settlement services by province, region, or city. Settlement.org was particularly helpful in finding detailed information about settlement services in Peel, Durham, Halton, and York Regions, which do not yet have an in-depth database like 211 Toronto. Since Settlement.org and 211 Toronto are partners, much of their information about services in the City of Toronto overlaps. In order to search the 211 Toronto database, key words and phrases such as "newcomer services," "immigrants," and "settlement services" were used. The search results produced lists of organizations. From these search results, individual organization profiles were printed and screened for settlement services. If an organization offered settlement services as a strong part of its mandate, it was included in this report. Many organizations listed on the 211 Toronto search results had satellite offices all over the GTA. For example, COSTI has 8 branches in Toronto. As much as possible, satellite and head offices were recognized individually in the following listings (Appendices 1-5).

Page 13 The United Way of Greater Toronto agency list was also a very useful tool in finding settlement service deliverers in the GTA. Each region's United Way branches were researched separately. When organization descriptions in this list were absent, each organization was individually researched to screen for settlement services. As mentioned earlier, a full account of settlement services in the outlying Regional Municipalities was not available on the 211 Toronto database, since its geographic focus is the City of Toronto. Fortunately, other sources could be used to address this problem. For example, settlement services in York Region were identified by using the municipality's search tool Yorklink. Yorklink is an online directory of social services offered in York Region. There is a direct link to the Yorklink database from the York Region website (www.region.york.on.ca). Settlement services in Peel Region were identified by using the listings on the Multicultural Inter-Agency Group (MIAG) link on Peel Region's website (www.miagspc.org). Organizations in Peel Region that were not listed on the MIAG were found by indepth searching through the Municipality of Peel Region, other internet sources, and existing listings. The sources used to find settlement services in Durham Region were the Durham R e gi o n's w ebsite (w w w .r egion.durham.on.ca) and Inform Durham (www.informdurham.com). Inform Durham is an on-line database of social service and community organizations in Durham region. Two key information databases for Halton Region were www.hipinfo.info and www.hhcsi.ca. The Halton Region's website was also helpful (www.region.halton.on.ca). In both Durham and Halton Regions, on-line listings of settlement-service providers were scarce. Therefore, individual emails asking for assistance were sent to leaders in the settlement service sector, as well as to the main newcomer-serving organizations in these two Regional Municipalities. Several other on-line sources were used to complete the appendices in this report. These included the websites of various organizations such as OCASI (Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants), the Council of Agencies Serving South Asians (CASSA), and Inform Ontario (www.informontario.on.ca). There were also several very informative on-line sources such as Cultures Canada, Citizenship and Immigration Canada, and Ontario's Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration. Also, many organizations, both broad and ethno-specific, were researched on-line through their websites. This exercise yielded valuable information about both their mandates and programs of services offered. The search for existing literature (books, journal articles, reports) on immigration and settlement was done through university library catalogues, indexes, and research centre databases. The latter included those associated with the Joint Centre of Excellence for Research in Immigration and Settlement (CERIS) and the Centre for Applied Social

Page 14 Research (CASR) at the University of Toronto. Also, the Urban Affairs Library branch of the Toronto Public Library, located at Metro Hall, was an extremely valuable source for the location of information on newcomers and settlement services. Lastly, broad searches using key words such as "settlement services Toronto" were performed on search engines such as Google (www.google.ca) and Yahoo (www.yahoo.ca).

Research on Funding Sources

Detailed information about funding sources for settlement services was researched individually for each type of fund. Information about federal government funds (LINC, ISAP and Host) was found at the Citizenship and Immigration Canada website. Similarly, information about the Newcomer Settlement program was obtained from the Province of Ontario's Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration website. Information about additional funding sources such as the United Way of Greater Toronto, the Ontario Trillium Foundation, and the Maytree Foundation were found at each respective website.

LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES

There were several limitations in the information-collection process that are noteworthy. These include concerns about the definition of settlement service agencies, the limitations of on-line searches, and the lack of data on funding sources.

Definition of settlement services

The multi-dimensional nature of the definition of a settlement service presented a challenge to the research methodology. Yet, the defining boundaries of settlement services must be determined. For example, some may define settlement services by their sources of funding, while others may define settlement services by their outreach activities and work with newcomers. There are potentially many settlement-service providers in the GTA that do not officially receive funding for their services or that do not officially advertise as settlement service providers. For example, many religious places of worship, especially those serving ethno-specific congregations, are likely to provide some services, such as orientation and information and referral.

Page 15 Limitations of on-line searching

Many limitations were embedded in the research methods used for this report, which were restricted to on-line searching and a few telephone contacts. Many settlement service providers are not listed on the Internet, but instead do outreach by word of mouth or nonelectronic methods, such as directories or advertisements. These "informal" settlement services are not captured in this report. Other methods for collecting information about settlement services could have been employed, such as talking to key informants in ethnic communities and visiting community organizations and places of worship. However, due to time and financial constraints, these methods could not be explored. Another limitation of on-line research methods is that information posted in this fashion often changes at a rapid pace. Much more information may now be on-line than was available when the research for this report took place.

Funding information

It was challenging to find out the sources from which settlement service providers received their funding. Many organizations do not share funding information publicly for various reasons, such as privacy or unstable and/or short funding cycles. Unless funding information was available through on-line sources, it was not included in this report. Unfortunately, the time limitations associated with this study did not allow for contacting individual organizations.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS

With the above caveats clearly in mind, the following snapshot can be provided concerning the nature and extent of the settlement services available in the Greater Toronto Area. Our research identified a total of 238 settlement-service agencies, 20 of which had more than one branch location, in the GTA. In total, the agencies operate at 280 locations throughout the GTA (Table 4). Based on their names, we identified 116 ethno-specific agencies; they represent 48.7% of all in the GTA. We stress once again that the methods used in this research to identify agencies, their funding sources, and program of services may not have been able to capture all such organizations and their complexities. As of 2001, 41.7 per cent of the residents of the Greater Toronto Area were immigrants, and 8.3 per cent of the GTA's population had arrived in Canada since 1996. These immigrants, however, were not evenly distributed throughout the five municipalities within the GTA. The City of Toronto was home to 57.8 per cent of the GTA's total

Page 16 immigrant population, and 66.8 per cent of its recent (1996-2001) arrivals. Without question, Toronto's share of the GTA's immigrants and recent immigrants has dropped over time. In 1996, for example, the City of Toronto was home to 61.2 per cent of the GTA's total immigrant population and 70.7 per cent of its recent (1991-1996) arrivals.5 These downward trends are expected to continue well into the future. Nevertheless, settlement-service agencies remain entrenched within the City of Toronto (Table 4), which, according to the data gathered for this report, was home to 82.8 per cent of the agencies identified and 81.4 per cent of all agency locations. Relative to their share of GTA immigrants, the four Regions of Peel, York, Durham and Halton are significantly under-represented in the location of newcomer service agencies. In 2001, Peel Region had 20.2 per cent of immigrants and 10.5 per cent of the agencies, York Region had 13.5 per cent of immigrants and 3.4 per cent of the agencies, Durham Region had 4.5 per cent of the immigrants and 1.7 per cent of the agencies, and Halton Region had 4.0 per cent of the immigrants and 1.7 per cent of the agencies. On the whole, then, settlement services agencies are relatively concentrated in the City of Toronto and under-represented in the surrounding regional municipalities. A closer balance should emerge over time, but inertia, inter-agency linkages, and government funding constraints to support new agencies may leave newer suburban areas beyond the City of Toronto particularly under-serviced for some time to come (Table 4). Our research allowed us to identify the funding sources for about 70 per cent of the agencies and agency locations uncovered through the methods described earlier in this report (Table 5). This does not mean that the rest of the settlement-service agencies have no funding sources; rather that such sources simply could not be identified via the means employed here. Interestingly, almost a third of the agencies uncovered by our research listed more than one source of funding. Put another way, of the 166 agencies for whom funding sources could be identified, 76, or 45.8 per cent, listed more than one funder. Over 20 separate sources of funding for settlement-service agencies operating within the GTA were identified through our research initiatives (Table 6). Other sources may well exist, especially with regard to agencies for whom no funding sources could be identified through our research methodology. Nevertheless, it is obvious from our data that the agencies in some municipalities had access to a greater range of funding opportunities than was true of their counterparts in other jurisdictions. Agencies in the City of Toronto, for example, took advantage of 19 funding sources, followed by those in York Region and Peel Region at 14, Durham Region at 6, and Halton Region at 4. Given the role of the Federal Government in the determination of immigration and refugee policies in Canada, it is hardly surprising that this level of government was the source of at least some funding for a majority of the settlement-service agencies in the GTA. In all, some 189, or 67.5 per cent of the identified agencies (including branches) listed the

Page 17 federal government as a source of funding. Of the three main federally-sponsored settlement initiatives, LINC funding was received by almost 30 per cent of the agencies, while 25 per cent were in receipt of funds for the ISAP Program. Only seven agencies (2.5 per cent) reported funding in support of the federal Host Program. In addition, some 28 agencies (10 per cent) reported funding from Human Resources Development Canada. The next most prominent source of funds was the United Way, with 169, or 60.4 per cent of the agencies (including branches) listing this source. This was followed by the Provincial Government, which provided money to some 76 agencies (27.1 per cent) primarily through four ministerial initiatives: Community and Social Services; Health; Training, Colleges, and Universities; and Citizenship and Immigration; the latter, in particular, provides for the Newcomer Settlement Program. Support from foundations was listed by 56 agencies (20 per cent), with the Ontario Trillium Foundation listed by 35 agencies, and the Maytree Foundation by 20. Funding from the Job Search Workshop was listed by 53 agencies (18.9 per cent). Some 31 agencies (11.1 per cent) received some financial support from the municipality in which they were located. A few agencies also listed other funders, including Legal Aid Ontario, the Resettlement Assistance Program, the Settlement and Education Partnership Toronto, the Community Access Program, the Ontario Women's Directorate, and Settlement Workers in Schools, all but the latter of which was exclusive to the City of Toronto. In evaluating these funding sources, it is worth remembering that many agencies, by design or need, draw on multiple sources for their annual budgets. The range of programs offered by the GTA's settlement-service agencies that could be identified through our research methodology is impressive (Table 7). At least one program type could be identified through sources used in this research for all but 20 of the 280 settlement-service agencies and their branches identified within the GTA. In all, 17 program categories could be defined. All were offered by the group of agencies found in the City of Toronto, while agencies in Peel Region offered 15, with 14 available from the agencies in York Region, 11 in Halton Region and 9 in Durham Region. Of the 17 categories, information and referral services, counseling and support groups and employment services were the most common activities, respectively provided by 166, 162 and 154 agencies and their branches (i.e. over half of all agency locations). These were followed by English-as-a-second-language instruction (108 agencies), translation and interpretation services (106 agencies), orientation services (102 agencies), and housing services (85 agencies); these services were provided in at least 30 per cent of the agency locations. Help with form filling, recreation and leisure, advocacy, and services for youth, women and seniors were available in between a fifth to a quarter of the agencies. The above were the more common programs; the least common was emergency food services which, together with advocacy services, were available only in the City of Toronto. Again it is worth remembering both that many agencies provide more than one category of service and the sources employed may not capture the full range of services offered by individual agencies. The above percentages, therefore, should be taken as "ballpark" figures, rather than as definitive statements.
