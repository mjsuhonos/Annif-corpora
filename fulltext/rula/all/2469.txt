Things  As  Yet  Unknown:  A  Finding  Aid  for  Selected   8x10  Negatives  from  the  Roger  Mertin  Archive      Adam  Giles  Ryan      Master  of  Arts,  2012   Photographic  Preservation  &  Collections  Management   Ryerson  University  &  George  Eastman  House            Abstract      This  thesis  and  project  centers  on  a  portion  of  the  8x10  inch  negatives  of  the  Roger   Mertin   Archive   at   George   Eastman   House,   International   Museum   of   Photography   &   Film,   in   Rochester,   New   York.   Roger   Mertin,   a   once-prominent   photographer,   came   of   age   artistically  during  a  turning  point  in  photographic  history--the  widespread  "academization"   of   the   field.   Sorely   under-researched,   Mertin's   work   remains   a   critical   example   of   an   aesthetic  attitude  exhibited  by  a  number  of  influential  photographers  from  his  generation.     Since   taking   custody   of   the   Archive,   GEH   has   kept   it   in   storage,   relatively   undisturbed.   Throughout   most   of   2012,   an   item-level   spreadsheet   was   compiled   and   the   objects   were   catalogued   and   given   accession   numbers.   In   satisfaction   of   the   requirements   for   a   Master's   degree  in  Photographic  Preservation  and  Collections  Management  from  Ryerson  University,   this  thesis  outlines,  discusses  and  defends  my  methodology.  The  resulting  finding  aid  also   includes  appendices  thought  to  be  useful  to  current  and  future  researchers.

Introduction      Roger   Mertin   would   wish   to   be   described,   above   all   else,   as   a   "working   photographer."   Even   now,   it   is   his   work   ethic   that   remains   the   most   prominent   memory   in   the  minds  of  those  who  knew  him.  Closely  associated  with  the  photographic  community  of   Rochester,  New  York,  his  work  and  his  life  straddle  a  revolutionary  time  in  the  history  of   photography.    On  the  following  pages,  I  will  describe  my  experience  of  processing  a  portion   of   his   archive   at   George   Eastman   House,   International   Museum   of   Photography   &   Film.   Dealing   solely   with   the   his   8x10   inch   negatives,   I   created   a   finding   aid   that   increases   intellectual  as  well  as  material  access,  and  contributes  to  the  preservation  of  the  physical   objects.     I  was  originally  introduced  to  Roger  Mertin's  work  in  a  history  of  photography  class,   as   an   undergraduate   student   at   the   Rochester   Institute   of   Technology.   The   instructor   for   that  course  was  David  Wooters--the  archivist  at  George  Eastman  House.  Unbeknownst  to   me,   he   was   also   inventorying   Mertin's   archive   at   the   time   as   well.   I   thought   Mertin's   photographs   were   rigorous   and   subtle,   powerful,   yet   filled   with   a   whispering   instructiveness.   Despite   Wooters'   departure   from   George   Eastman   House,   and   my   continuance   into   graduate   school,   the   truth   that   I   found   in   Mertin's   photographs   stayed   with  me.  When  I  returned  to  Rochester  to  complete  my  final  year  of  graduate  work,  I  found   myself  standing  in  the  "Mertin  Room"  at  George  Eastman  House,  unable  to  resist  the  urge   to   visually  inhale   the   photographs   and   negatives   found   in   the   boxes.   My  final   decision  on   a   thesis   topic   stemmed   from   a   desire--something   I   can   only   describe   as   a   hunger--to   consume   the   vision   of   a   photographer   who   possessed   greater   complexity   and   more   artistic   maturity   than   myself.   It   was   an   educational   opportunity,   both   professional   and   personal,   that  I  could  not  pass  up.   This  written  portion  of  my  thesis  outlines  the  steps  I  took  to  create  the  finding  aid,   which   was   assembled   from   January   2012   to   August   2012,   and   justifies   the   choices   that   I   made  in  the  process.  After  relating  the  texts  that  aided  me  along  the  way,  I  will  consider  the   history  of  the  Mertin  Archive  and  theories  informing  the  concept  of  original  order.  This  will   strengthen  my  argument  that  the  rearranging  of  the  Mertin  Archive  is  patently  justifiable   and  desirable.  The  Methodology  section  will  explain  in  technical  terms  my  modus  operandi   1  

in  generating,  gathering  and  organizing  data  from  the  Mertin  Archive.  Embedded  within  my   thesis   is   the   official   finding   aid.   Some   information   found   in   the   thesis   is   repeated   in   the   body   of   the   finding   aid   because   it   is   meant   to   be   a   stand-alone   document.   My   finding   aid   includes   a   chronology,   an   itemized   list   of   Mertin's   known   bodies   of   work,   an   overview   of   the   objects'   arrangement,   thorough   lists   of   his   exhibitions   (both   solo   and   group)   and   publications,  as  well  as  the  most  comprehensive  biography  yet  written  on  Roger  Mertin.     This  thesis  presents  what  I  have  achieved  thus  far,  and  calls  for  others  to  continue   the  work.  The  full  potential  of  the  Roger  Mertin  Archive  can  only  be  unlocked  after  critical   decisions  of  practicality  have  been  made.  It  must  be  arranged  properly  so  that  access  may   be  granted.  My  work  has  begun  this  process,  but  others  must  finish  it.  I  am  confident  that   the  data  found  in  this  thesis  will  serve  as  the  starting  point  for  later,  greater  research--just   as   this   thesis   has   benefitted   greatly   from   the   dedication   and   thoroughness   of   Photographic   Preservation  &  Collections  Management  Alumna  Jessica  McDonald,  with  her  past  research   on  the  life  and  work  of  Roger  Mertin.

Literature  Survey         When  gathering  sources,  two  distinct  categories  established  themselves.  One  group   of  sources  deals  with  the  creation  of  finding  aids  and  archival  theory.  The  other  group  deals   with  information  about  Roger  Mertin.  PPCM  alumna  Jessica  McDonald  previously  compiled   a  number  of  sources  dealing  with  Mertin's  bibliography,  biography,  exhibition  history,  etc.   Her   initial   research   allowed   me   to   begin   this   project   with   the   advantage   of   having   multiple   leads   already   identified.   McDonald   laid   the   foundation   for   the   eventual   understanding   of   the  Mertin  Archive.  I,  in  turn,  will  expand  this  knowledge,  and  bring  this  process  closer  to   completion.          I  began  by  examining  previous  finding  aids  by  former  Ryerson  students.  The  theses   by   Amanda   Smith1  and   Lisa   Hennessey2  aided   me   greatly.   Smith's   thesis   is   an   example   of   the   well-considered   structure   that   I   aim   to   achieve   with   my   own   thesis.   Smith   also   pointed   out   useful   resources   in   her   literature   survey.   Hennessey's   thesis   has   well   written   procedural  steps,  and  her  clear  writing  also  serves  as  an  example  of  how  someone  might   effectively  explain  a  practical  methodology.        Two   books   have   been   useful   when   thinking   about   the   priorities   of   a   finding   aid.   Gregory   Hunter's   Developing   and   Maintaining   Practical   Archives:   A   How-To-Do-It   Manual   (2003)  is  a  very  accessible  and  readable  guide  to  dealing  with  collections  material.  I  found   Hunter's   section   on   arrangement   to   be   helpful.   It   allowed   me   to   more   sharply   define   my   priorities  when  dealing  with  the  Roger  Mertin  Archive.  Mary  Ritzenthaler's  and  Diane  Vogt- O'Connor's   book,   Photographs:   Archival   Care   and   Management   (2006),   is   an   exhaustive   volume   with   worthwhile   information   on   all   facets   of   this   field.   Specifically,   Helena   Zinkman's   chapter,   "Description   and   Cataloguing,"   explained   in   great   detail   the   various   components  that  go  into  a  successful  finding  aid.        While   completing   my   summer   internship   in   2011,   I   worked   with   various   finding   aids  at  the  Historical  Society  of  Pennsylvania.  I  found  inspiration  in  a  finding  aid  written  by

Joanne   Danifo   for   the   "Lantern   and   Lens   Gild   [sic]   of   Women   Photographers"   collection.3   The   layout   and   formatting   epitomize   utility.   Danifo   also   successfully   balanced   length   and   comprehensiveness.   Another   existing   finding   aid   from   which   I   learned   is   the   guide   to   the   Paul   Strand   Collection   at   the   Center   for   Creative   Photography   in   Tucson,   Arizona.4  While   much   longer   than   Danifo's,   it   shows   the   information   relevant   to   a   finding   aid   for   the   collection  of  an  individual  photographer.  The  entire  document  also  serves  as  a  warning  of   the  dangers  of  creating  a  finding  aid  so  large  as  to  be  ungainly.        Another   topic   of   particular   importance   to   my   thesis   is   "original   order."   The   combination   of   provenance   and   original   order   acts   as   a   linchpin   in   the   mechanisms   of   archival   stewardship.   A   further   discussion   of   original   order   and   its   impact   on   the   Roger   Mertin   Archive   can   be   found   on   page   10.   However,   here   I   will   consider   the   various   sources   that   helped   me   understand   what   I   was   confronting--a   principle   of   practicality,   but   one   which  academia  has  destabilized  for  good  reason.     My   list   of   sources   relating   to   original   order   expanded   tremendously   after   finding   Jane  Zhang's  PhD  dissertation  for  Simmons  College.5  Her  bibliography  provided  a  number   of   articles   that   challenged   me   to   think   differently   about   archival   theory.   Her   dissertation   was   particularly   helpful   in   giving   the   history   of   original   order   and   the   field   of   archival   practice  in  general,  along  with  the  writings  of  figures  such  as  Theodore  Schellenberg6,  Sir   Hilary  Jenkinson7  and  the  trio  Muller,  Feith  and  Fruin.8   More  recent  writings  have  further  questioned  original  order.  "Disrespecting  Original   Order,"  by  Frank  Boles9  establishes  a  very  clear  distinction  between  collections  created  by   corporate  or  group  entities  and  those  created  by  individuals.  It  was  in  Boles'  article  that  I   first   came   across   the   assertion   that   "an   archivist   `should   have   no   compunction   about   rearranging   series   in   relation   to   each   other   or   single   record   items   within   them   if   by   so   doing   he   can   make   the   records   more   intelligible   and   more   serviceable.   The   test   here   is   a

very  practical  one  of  usability'"10  (Boles  quoting  Schellenberg).   Brien  Brothman11  interrogates  the  language  used  to  talk  about  archives.  He  argues   that  archivists  are  not  objective  and  the  space  of  the  archive  influences,  and  is  influenced   by,   societal   values   and   cultural   norms.   Heather   MacNeil12  argues   for   more   widespread   acceptance  of  the  inevitable  change  that  every  archive  makes  to  every  collection.  She  calls   this   principle   "archivalterity."   Her   ideas   have   greatly   influenced   my   own,   especially   the   realization   that   clinging   to   original   order   is   in   many   cases   wishful   thinking   and   the   understanding   that   "orders   given   to   the   records   by   their   various   custodians--or   at   least   what   survives   of   these   various   orders--are   as   relevant   to   the   present   meaning   and   authenticity  of  the  archive  as  the  order  given  to  the  records  by  its  creator."13      Sources  on  the  life  of  Roger  Mertin  come  from  various  places.  The  information  files   from   Visual   Studies   Workshop   have   been   valuable.   This   includes   curricula   vitae,   chronologies,   a   "Photographer's   Biographical   Data   Sheet,"   transcripts   of   interviews   and   more.  This  material  contains  information  that  may  not  exist  elsewhere.  Two  photography   books   edited   by   Sally   Eauclaire   in   the   1980s   situate   Mertin's   work   within   the   larger   community  of  working  fine  art  photographers,  providing  the  context  necessary  to  glimpse   the  path  to  widespread  recognition  that  Mertin  was  on  at  one  time.14,15     In  2002,  Jeffrey  Hoone,  Executive  Director  at  Light  Work  Gallery,  wrote  a  descriptive   text   on   Mertin   that   considers   his   methodology   and   commitment   to   photography.16  The   essay   from   Mertin's   major   exhibition   publication,   Roger   Mertin:   Records   1976-78   (1978),   written   by   Charles   Desmarais,   investigates   Mertin's   work   with   a   method   reminiscent   of   John  Szarkowski,  while  identifying  Walker  Evans  and  Eugéne  Atget  as  "spiritual"  ancestors.

Tannenbaum,  O  Christmas  Tree"  (1991)  analyzes  the  series   Die  Tannenbaumserie,  as  well   as  provides  further  biographical  information.     One   source   that   proved   very   useful   is   an   interview   conducted   by   William   Johnson   and   Susie   Cohen,   brought   together   in   print   form   for   the   Rochester   Film   and   Photo   Consortium   at   George   Eastman   House   in   December   1989.   It   contains   important   information,  as  well  as  helpful  anecdotes,  related  by  Mertin  himself,  about  his  young  adult   life  as  a  photography  student  at  RIT  and  his  experience  in  Rochester.  Other  sources  show   the   influence   that   Mertin   wielded   later   in   life,   such   as   his   connection   to   Magnum   photographer  Alec  Soth,  made  by  Siri  Engberg  when  she  discusses  Soth's  development  as   an   artist.17  Rod   Slemmons,   in   an   exhibition   essay   titled   "Zeroing   In,"   considers   Mertin's   artistic   intentions   while   establishing   a   lineage   to   Eugéne   Atget   and   stresses   a   "kind   of   perceptual  realization...  at  the  core  of  Mertin's  work,"  relating  to  his  various  typologies.18   Similar   to   Eauclaire's   books,   this   exhibition   included   Mertin   along   with   significant   artists   working   in   photography   such   as   Ed   Ruscha,   Bernd   and   Hilla   Becher,   Candida   Hofer,   Thomas   Ruff,   Thomas   Struth   and   others.   Once   again,   Mertin's   inclusion   in   this   kind   of   company  suggests  he  was  an  important  photographic  artist  of  his  time.  There  are  a  number   of   other   far-flung   sources   that   contribute,   in   a   collective   sense,   to   understanding   Roger   Mertin   as   a   photographer.   A   list   of   these   additional   references   can   be   found   in   the   bibliography  of  my  thesis,  on  page  60.

An  Account  of  the  Roger  Mertin  Archive         I   have   chosen   to   include   a   short   history   of   the   material   that   now   comprises   the   Roger   Mertin   Archive.   This   is   valuable   information   because   it   sheds   light   on   how   the   objects   arrived   at   their   current   ordering.   This   information   also   corroborates   my   belief   that   altering   the   arrangement   of   the   material   is   valid   and   defensible,   because   it   shows   that   Roger   Mertin   was   only   partially   responsible   for   its   arrangement.   Elizabeth   Ihrig,   Mertin's   former   partner,   is   the   primary   source   of   this   information.   After   corresponding   with   her   over  a  period  of  months,  I  have  pieced  together  a  brief  account  of  the  various  movements  of   the   objects   through   time.   This   description   is   also   reproduced   in   the   body   of   my   finding   aid,   in   the   Background   Note   (on   page   23).   As   the   Archive   represents   the   merger   of   two   distinct   segments   of   Mertin's   records,   I   will   discuss   the   material   as   belonging   to   "Group   1"   or   "Group  2."      The   material   that   comprises   the   Mertin   Archive   was,   at   one   time,   stored   together   in   Rochester.   Mertin   owned   a   house   in   downtown   Rochester,   located   at   16   Upton   Park.   The   house   is   between   East   Avenue   and   University   Avenue,   only   half   a   mile   from   George   Eastman   House   and   a   mere   700   yards   from   Visual   Studies   Workshop.   According   to   Ihrig,   Mertin   lived   on   the   second   floor   of   the   house   while   renting   out   the   first   floor.   Also   according  to  Ihrig,  Mertin  owned  the  house  next  door,  18  Upton  Park  (which,  at  one  point,   he   rented   to   a   group   of   nuns).   Any   of   his   work   that   had   not   entered   an   institutional   or   private  collection  resided  with  Mertin  at  16  Upton  Park  or  in  his  office  at  the  University  of   Rochester.        Then   in   1992,   Mertin   relocated   to   Minneapolis   to   be   with   Ihrig.   However,   he   maintained  ownership  of  his  house  in  Rochester,  where  the  bulk  of  his  material  still  resided.   It  should  be  noted  that  any  work  he  produced  while  living  in  Minneapolis  remained  there,   at   515   Fifth   Avenue   S.E.,   #6.   In   1997,   Mertin   and   Ihrig   moved   to   56   Arundel,   Saint   Paul,   Minnesota.  At  this  time,  Mertin  brought  a  portion  of  the  work  being  stored  in  Rochester  to   Saint  Paul.  The  combination  of  the  work  he  produced  since  1992  (in  the  Twin  Cities),  and   the   work   he   relocated   to   St.   Paul   in   1997,   forms   what   I   will   call   "Group   1."   Group   1   also   contained   items   that   Ihrig   gathered   after   Mertin's   death   from   scattered   dealers,   recently  

7  

printed  lab  work  and  an  exhibition  that  was  hanging  in  a  college  gallery  forty  miles  from   their  home.  According  to  Ihrig,  Mertin  organized  much  of  Group  1  himself.        After   Mertin's   death   in   2001,   his   sister   Ruth   Meyer   collected   any   work   that   still   remained   in   Rochester,   at   his   house   and   office.   I   will   call   this   "Group   2."   Group   2   was   relocated   to   Meyer's   home   in   Stratford,   Connecticut.   During   this   time,   it   appears   that   artist   Michaela   Murphy   (Mertin's   former   girlfriend)   made   contact   prints   from   some   of   Mertin's   8x10   negatives.   These   prints   still   reside   with   the   negatives.   The   material   remained   in   Stratford   for   one   year,   and   then   was   moved   to   St.   Paul.   Ihrig   recounts   that   Group   2   was   stored   in   the   space   of   a   local   art   dealer,   Thomas   Barry   Fine   Arts.   Between   this   time   and   2006,  Ihrig  inventoried  Group  1.        Group  1                                                                                                                                                              Group  2   -Work  made  after  1992                                                                                                    -Work  that  remained                                           -Work  Mertin  moved                                                                                                                  in  Rochester  &  was                                               to  Saint  Paul  in  1997                                                                                                                removed  by  Ruth  Meyer         In   2006,   George   Eastman   House   received   a   grant   from   the   Judith   Rothschild   Foundation  to  bring  the  entire  Archive  back  to  Rochester.  According  to  the  grant  proposal   (found  on  page  69):    
   Mertin's   work   is   not   widely   recognized   beyond   that   community   of   curators   and   artists  who  trace  their  careers  to  enthusiasms  of  the  1970s  and  1980s.  The  reason   for  this  eclipse  is  central  to  our  interest  in  the  Mertin  collection  and  central  to  this   application   of   support   from   the   Judith   Rothschild   Foundation:   Roger's   career   exemplifies   a   brief   epoch   in   the   practice   of   fine   art   photography--a   practice   that   prefigures   the   surpassing   ubiquity   of   postmodern   camera   work.   Roger   may   be   the   most  perfect  embodiment  of  art  making  that  originated  inside  photograpy.     

GEH   sent   Rick   Hock   and   Sean   Corcoran   to   retrieve   it   in   its   entirety--at   the   time   of   writing,   these  men  are  now  the  Archivist  at  Visual  Studies  Workshop  and  the  Curator  of  Prints  and   Photographs  at  the  Museum  of  the  City  of  New  York,  respectively.  In  June  2006,  Ihrig,  Hock   and  Corcoran  loaded  Group   2  onto  a  truck.  During  this  loading  process,  Hock  and  Corcoran   8  

created  a  checklist  for  Group  2.  The  following  day,  Group  1  was  loaded  into  the  truck.  I  have   included   Ihrig's   inventory   of   Group   1   as   an   appendix   to   this   thesis   (page   111).   The   entirety   of   the   Mertin   Archive   was   then   brought   to   George   Eastman   House.   When   it   arrived,   the   archivist   at   the   time,   David   Wooters,   began   to   inventory   the   material   as   one   unit.   His   inventory   is   box   level,   and   includes   tallies   for   number   of   items   in   each   box   and   basic   subjects  represented  (i.e.  trees,  portraits,  hoops,  xmas  trees,  etc).       I  was  uncertain  what  relationship  Wooters'  inventory  had  to  Elizabeth  Ihrig's.  After   speaking   with   her   and   examining   her   inventory,   it   is   clear   that   they   are   different   documents.   Group   1   and   Group   2   are   now   the   "Roger   Mertin   Archive."   It   appears   that   Wooters  used  Ihrig's  inventory  to  guide  the  creation  of  his  own.  He  preserves  some  of  the   box  designations  that  she  uses,  such  as  "N"  for  negatives  and  "P"  for  prints.  Wooters  made  a   number   of   alterations   to   Group   1's   ordering.   He   also   records   different   information   about   each  box  (or  binder),  such  as  precise  tallies.  When  comparing  both  inventories  line-by-line,   it  is  not  immediately  clear  that  they  refer  to  the  same  boxes--however,  I  believe  they  do  in   the   majority   of   cases.   Wooters   also   inventoried   what   use   to   be   Group   2.   Ihrig   did   not   inventory  Group  2,   thus   Wooters'  document  is  the  first  of  its  kind.  In  it,  he  does  not  use  the   N  or  P  designations.  Based  on  the  imprecise  overlap  between  the  two  inventories,  it  may  be   possible,   theoretically,   to   separate   Group   1   and   2   again.   However,   I   do   not   believe   the   benefits  of  doing  so  are  proportionate  to  the  resources  required,  both  in  time  and  space.     Now   that   the   reader   has   an   understanding   of   the   varied   components   of   the   Roger   Mertin   Archive,   I   can   address   the   issues   related   to   the   rearranging   of   the   material.   Understanding   the   somewhat   tangled   movements   of   the   pieces   that   comprise   the   Roger   Mertin   Archive   informs   the   stance   I   take   on   the   question   of   original   order   in   the   next   section.

The  Principle  of  Original  Order  &  its  Implications  for  the  Mertin  Archive         Aside   from   this   project's   numerous   practical   considerations,   there   was   a   sizeable   theoretical   issue   that   demanded   attention.   "Original   order"   is   a   ubiquitous   concept   in   archival  science.  The  binary  doctrine  of  provenance  and  original  order  has  functioned  as  a   foundational   principle   in   document   repositories   for   over   a   century.   When   I   began   this   project,   I   did   not   realize   the   significance   this   would   have   for   the   Mertin   Archive.   Original   order   and   the   ultimate   arrangement   of   the   Mertin   Archive   matters   a   great   deal--both   to   those   who   will   work   with   it   firsthand,   and   to   the   public   who   will   gain   a   holistic   understanding   of   it   from   researchers   and   historians.   The   realization   that   archivists   influence   the   telling   of   history   is   a   profound   one.   I   desperately   wanted   to   get   this   right,   because  I  knew  that  my  choices  would  become  part  of  the  Archive's  history.      As   I   learned   about   the   importance   of   original   order   and   its   sway   in   the   field   of   archival  science,  I  realized  I  would  have  to  delve  into  its  history  and  theory.  Rearranging  an   institutionalized   collection   is   not   something   to   be   done   lightly.   My   initial   anxiety   was   rooted   in   the   fear   that   my   actions   would   obscure,   or   somehow   destroy,   knowledge   that   might   be   implicitly   gained   by   preserving   and   studying   the   "authentic"   organization   in   which   the   material   arrived.   I   believe   my   anxiety   was   the   result   of   misunderstanding   the   discursive   relationship   between   the   content   creator,   the   institution,   the   archivist   and   the   public.   With   the   rise   of   postmodern   thought,   much   of   archival   discourse   has   been   challenged,   original   order   included.19  What   are   the   limits   of   this   idea?   When   does   the   concept  become  more  of  a  burden  than  a  benefit?  What  responsibilities  does  an  archivist   have,  and  how  does  he  or  she  prioritize  original  order  vis-à-vis  collections  access?      The  distinction  between  personal  archives  and  non-personal  archives  is  important   to  make.  Original  order  "became  widely  accepted  by  archivists  dealing  with  governmental   or  other  institutional  records.  Archivists  responsible  for  the  care  of  personal  papers  have   been   far   more   reluctant   to   accept   the   principle." 20   Boles   identifies   four   reasons   why   original  order  has  persisted  as  a  guiding  principle,  two  practical  and  two  theoretical.  In  a

practical   sense,   it   is   cheap   and   frequently   works.   In   a   large   number   of   cases,   keeping   a   collection   in   its   original   order   is   satisfactory.   Archives   also   rarely   have   the   funding   to   systemically   reorganize   large   collections.   The   issue   becomes   more   complex   when   examining  it  from  a  theoretical  perspective:       
Historically,   the   ordering   of   documents   by   their   creator   reveals   information   about   the   character   and   organization   of   the   creator   independent   of   the   documents'   content.   Original   order   has   evidential   value.   It   also   has   archival   value   in   that   it   broadens   considerably   the   cardinal   principle   of   provenance...   Not   only   is   the   integrity   of   the   creator's   documentary   body   respected,   but   also   the   creator's   ordering.21     

Reorganizing   a   collection   is   easily   justified   if   only   considering   the   practical   reasons.   However,   original   order's   presumed   connection   to   the   principle   of   provenance   (maintaining   a   single   creator's   documents   as   a   distinct   unit)   confuses   the   matter.   When   judging   whether   a   collection   can   be   rearranged,   the   archivist   must   weigh   the   evidential   value   of   the   documents   with   the   evidential   value   of   their   filing   system.   This   means   the   archivist   must   evaluate   the   potential   data   to   be   gained   by   studying   the   filing   system   and   compare  it  to  data  found  in  the  documents  themselves.     What   does   the   ordering   of   the   Archive   reveal   about   Roger   Mertin?   It   is   worth   remembering   that   Mertin   is   only   partially   responsible   for   the   "original"   order   that   the   Archive   currently   is   in.   Its   size,   shape,   location   and   ordering   fluctuated   in   the   years   immediately   following   his   death.   Entire   segments   of   the   collection   have   different   historical   trajectories,   only   to   be   united   into   a   comprehensive   oeuvre   after   Mertin's   death.   That   must   surely   weaken   claims   that   the   Archive's   current   arrangement   reveals   something   of   paramount   importance   to   understanding   Roger   Mertin   as   a   photographer,   creator   and   organizer.   The   archive's   arrangement   does   say   something,   but   not   necessarily   something   about  Roger  Mertin  individually--and  clearly  not  something  so  significant  that  preserving   that  order  should  outweigh  the  providing  of  access  to  the  photographs.  The  original  order   cannot  be  preserved  while  also  granting  access  to  the  collection  material.  Its  arrangement

does  not  allow  access.  In  this  case,  a  choice  must  be  made.   However,   digital   technology   provides   the   archivist   with   additional   options.   My   methodology   preserves   the   Mertin   Archive's   original   order   in   metadata.   The   digital   entry   for   each   object   contains   a   record   of   its   previous   location.   This   allows   the   earlier   arrangement  to  be  reconstructed  at  a  later  date.  This  means,  in  a  practical  sense,  that  my   arrangement   is   reversible.   It   is   unlikely   that   a   reversion   will   ever   be   necessary,   but   the   option  exists  nevertheless.     The   confirmed   information   found   in   the   photographs   is   more   important   than   the   information  (of  uncertain  value)  to  be  gained  by  studying  the  Archive's  arrangement.  This   is   the   kind   of   value   judgment   that   archivists   must   make.   Archivists   regularly   make   these   judgments.  The  paradigm  of  archivist-as-custodian  has  lost  its  relevancy.  The  relationship   between  an  archivist  and  the  material  under  his  or  her  care  has  complexity  that  has  only   been   recognized   in   the   last   few   decades.   Archivists   do   not   passively   identify   objects   of   archival  or  historical  value,  but  actively  invest  objects  with  value  by  bringing  them  into  an   archive   and   ordering   them.   Archivists   can   no   longer   presume   to   stand   on   a   pedestal   of   objectivity--nor   should   they   feel   the   need   to.   "For   archivists   to   abstain   from   cultural   awareness   and   criticism   is   tantamount   to   professional   irresponsibility.   It   amounts   to   a   shirking   of   the   unique   and   positive   task   that   each   generation   of   archivists   has,   or   should   have,   of   continually   replenishing   its   intellectual   resources   and   reaffirming   its   cultural   station."22   Brothman  employs  a  useful  metaphor,  comparing  archivists  who  cling  to  the  tenet   of  original  order  with  historians  who  claim  to  capture  the  past  and  bring  it  to  the  present.23   It   is   no   surprise   that,   in   this   era   of   postmodernity,   original   order   has   been   called   into   question--originality  itself  has  been  challenged,  along  with  objectivity.  If  original  order  is   about   primary   context,   is   it   not   damaged,   at   its   most   basic   level,   when   a   collection   is   removed   from   the   physical   location   where   it   was   first   stored?   Simply   putting   it   in   an   archive  changes  its  context.  Brothman  reinforces  this  notion:

Archives   do   not   live   in   hermetic   isolation   from   the   rest   of   the   world,   for   they   do   not   transcend  the  social  and  cultural  forces  that  have  shaped  our  modern,  information- hungry,   knowledge-based   (or   is   it   knowledge-basing)   society;   they,   too,   are   positioned   within--determined   by--the   web   of   information   production,   exchange   and  circulation.  Archives  constitute  a  web  within  a  web.24     

He  concludes  by  stating:       
Archives,   in   other   words,   have   been   too   much   regarded   as   culturally   transparent   sites   rather  than  as  constituents  or  objects  within  a  larger,  historically  characterizable  structure   which   both   determines   and   is   determined   by   archival   practice   through   a   dynamic   of   negotiated   social   and   cultural   relations...   The   history   of   the   record   does   not   stop   at   the   portals  of  archives.  Archives  are  participants  in  that  history.25       

Heather   MacNeil   echoes   this   viewpoint   of   active,   even   optimistic,   participation   by   the   archivist.   The   "meaning   of   a   body   of   records   is   shaped   not   only   by   its   archival   bond   [to   its  creator]  but,  also,  by  what  we  might  term  a   custodial  bond,  meaning  the  relations  that   exist   between   a   body   of   records   and   [its]   various   custodial   authorities."26  Time   does   not   stop   changing   a   collection   when   it   enters   an   archive,   neither   physically   (much   to   the   chagrin  of  conservators)  nor  semantically.  A  collection  will  change,  and  be  changed  by,  the   society  that  preserves  it.  The  relationship  is  dialectical,  cyclical.     Moreover,   MacNeil   asserts   that   the   creator-to-collection   relationship   and   the   archivist-to-collection   relationship   are   both   equally   important   and   valid. 27   This   would   mean   that   the   relationship   of   David   Wooters   (or   Elizabeth   Ihrig,   or   Adam   Ryan)   to   the   Roger  Mertin  Archive  is  just  as  important  to  its  history  as  that  of  Roger  Mertin  himself.  This   statement   has   profound   implications.   Rather   than   viewing   the   intellectual   residue   of   individuals   other   than   Roger   Mertin   as   a   contamination   or   corruption   of   his   Archive,   it   can   instead   be   accepted,   even   embraced,   as   the   natural   accumulation--and   maybe   even   transformation--of  meaning  that  comes  to  every  product  of  human  creation.  This  view  is

hopeful,  even  celebratory.  Its  language  does  not  try  to  paralyze  the  Roger  Mertin  Archive  or   restrict  it  to  one  set  of  meanings.  It  acknowledges  that  the  Archive  can,  and  will,  drift  free   and   acquire   new   meanings   over   time,   even   while   it   resides   within   the   walls   of   George   Eastman  House.        I   encourage   and   welcome   other   cataloguers   to   refine   the   sequencing   of   the   material   within   Roger   Mertin's   respective   bodies   of   work.   Since   this   is   the   beginning   of   a   long   process,  I  am  confident  that  some  future  expert  will  be  able  to  organize  the  negatives  in  a   more   perfectly   chronological   way.   I   hope   this   further   honing   of   the   arrangement   takes   place.   A   more   thorough   chronological   sequence   would   help   tap   into   the   Archive's   considerable   potential.   For   example,   one   could   compare   and   evaluate   the   photographs   from   two   different   bodies   of   work   made   in   the   same   year.   If   the   bodies   of   work   are   separated   and   arranged   chronologically,   then   the   evolution   of   each   can   be   studied   in   isolation  (as  the  unfolding  of  an  internal  set  of  negotiations),  as  well  as  in  tandem  with  its   siblings  (as  embedded  in  a  larger,  external  dialogue).        The   solution   for   one   collection   may   not   be   the   solution   for   another.   There   is   no   definitive   step-by-step   process   that   applies   to   all   collections.   In   many   cases,   improvements   and  fixes  need  to  be  carried  out  on  an   ad  hoc  basis.  My  methodology,  outlined  in  the  next   section,  is  an  example  of  such  a  tailored  response.                 

14  

Methodology         The   beginning   of   this   process   was   confusing.   The   first   step   was   to   summon   the   willpower  to  confront  such  a  large  collection.  To  stand  in  the  "Mertin  Room"  is  to  be  faced   with   questions   like,   "Okay,   now   what?"   Preservation   concerns,   and   the   guidance   given   to   me   by   GEH   Assistant   Curator   Jamie   Allen,   narrowed   my   focus   to   the   negatives.   Starting   with   the   negatives   was   logical   because   I   previously   gained   experience   working   with   negative  materials  at  the  Historical  Society  of  Pennsylvania.  After  examining  the  extent  of   the   Mertin   Archive,   I   chose   to   further   restrict   my   work   to   8x10   inch   negatives   (of   which   there   are   nearly   8,000)--mainly   due   to   time   constraints,   knowing   full   well   that   I   would   only  work  through  a  portion  of  them.   I  used  a  Microsoft  Excel  spreadsheet  to  record  any  relevant  information,  keeping  in   mind   that   this   information   would   make   its   way   into   George   Eastman   House's   collections   management  system,  TMS  (The  Museum  System).  During  this  stage,  I  would  also  assign  an   accession  number  to  each  negative.  The  key  objective  was  to  increase  access  to  the  Mertin   Archive  by  rearranging  the  material  with  a  more  sensible  schema.  The  major  consideration   that  shaped  my  plan  was  how  researchers  would  most  likely  seek  to  enter  the  work.  This  is   a  subjective  determination,  but  one  that  can  withstand  scrutiny.  Arranging  the  material  by   body   of   work,   and   then   chronologically,   makes   the   most   sense   because   it   is   the   most   consistent   with   this   photographer's   project-based   working   method.   As   a   monographic   collection,  the  Roger  Mertin  Archive  begs  a  different  kind  of  interpretation  when  compared   to   one   with   multiple   or   unknown   content   creators.   It   can,   among   other   things,   showcase   the   artistic   vision   of   one   person.   Indeed,   the   investigation   of   a   singular   man's   photographic   vision--along   with   his   mental,   emotional   and   intellectual   evolution--is   where   I   believe   a   large   part   of   this   Archive's   significance   lies.   When   developing   my   methodology,   I   had   to   bear  in  mind  that  many  are  unfamiliar  with  Roger  Mertin's  work.  Consequently,  I  knew  that   his  Archive  would  need  to  be  arranged  in  a  way  that  promoted  ease  of  use  and  discovery  of   artistic  intention.  Body  of  work,  or  series,  was  the  obvious  choice.     Understanding  how  to  begin  and  where  to  begin  was  the  most  difficult  part  of  this   project.  My  original  workflow  entailed  pulling  a  box  off  the  shelf  and  processing  all  of  the   negatives   it   contained   (recording   data,   assigning   accession   numbers,   etc.).   In   addition   to   15  

being  inefficient,  this  method  also  introduced  major  obstacles  that  caused  me  to  abandon  it   after   cataloguing   nearly   150   negatives.   Many   of   the   negatives   contain   ambiguous   subject   matter.   I   realized   that   if   I   was   to   organize   the   negatives   according   to   bodies   of   work,   as   close  to  Mertin's  own  understanding  as  possible,  I  could  not  proceed  in  a  purely  linear  way.   There  were  too  many  unanswered  questions.  The  margin  of  error  in  matching  a  negative  to   a   poorly   understood   body   of   work   was   too   high.   I   realized   that   I   would   need   to   choose   a   single   series   and   work   solely   on   gathering   those   negatives   together,   even   if   that   meant   searching  through  the  same  box  at  a  later  time.   My  workflow  evolved  into  something  more  serviceable.  This  was  possible  because   of  the  preliminary  inventory  created  by  David  Wooters,  former  Eastman  House  archivist.  I   combed   through   his   document,   line   by   line,   and   populated   a   list   of   subject   keywords   and   their   corresponding   locations.   For   example,   I   listed   all   the   boxes   where   Wooters   found   "Xmas  trees,"  or  annotated  a  box  listing  with  "Tannenbaumserie."  This  provided  me  with  a   roadmap,   showing   where   to   look   for   certain   negatives.   Instead   of   picking   a   box   and   cataloguing   all   the   negatives   inside,   I   began   to   search   for   specific   boxes   and   pick   out   the   relevant   negatives.   Working   this   way   also   meant   I   would   only   need   to   process   a   few   hundred  negatives  to  vet  my  methodology,  as  opposed  to  a  few  thousand.  I  chose  Mertin's   Die  Tannenbaumserie   as   my   first   body   of   work   to   gather   together   because   of   the   better- known  imagery  and  the  negatives  could  be  more  easily  identified.       After  finding  a  relevant  box,  I  would   verify   its   contents   as   recorded   in   Wooters'   inventory,   while   noting   any   relevant   information   found   on   the   box   (or   inner   dividers   if   present).   During   this   stage,   I   would  examine  the  negatives  and  the  box  to   identify   any   urgent   preservation   concerns.   In   some   instances,   the   boxes   were   not   entirely   full   of   negatives.   The   empty   space   caused  the  negatives  to  sag  against  one  side   of  the  box.  To  combat  this,  I  made  inserts  of  scored  mat  board  to  hold  the  negatives  upright   (see  fig.  1).  Some  of  the  negatives  were  stored  in  acetate  sleeves  with  strips  of  masking  tape   16  

adhered  to  them.  The  adhesive  from  the  tape  spread  to  other  parts  of  the  sleeve,  causing   certain   sleeves   to   stick   together.   These   I   rehoused   in   acid   free   paper   envelopes,   while   transcribing   any   information   from   the   old   sleeve   onto   the   new.   Bare   negatives   also   were   placed  in  new  envelopes.   At   this   point,   I   assigned   an   accession   number   to   each   negative.   At   Eastman   House,   accession   numbers   have   three   tiers.28  The   first   tier   of   the   Mertin   Archive   would   invariably  be  2006.  The  lot  numbers  would   demarcate   the   Archive   into   chronological,   all-encompassing   five-year   periods,   as   predetermined   by   the   Registrar   (see   page   54   for   a   lengthier   explanation).   The   item   numbers   were   to   be   assigned   sequentially   as   I   worked   through   the   material.   After   an   accession   number   was   logged   into   the   Excel   spreadsheet,   I   would   write   the   number,   in   pencil,  on  the  negative's  sleeve  (see  fig.  2).  If   the  negative  was  stored  in  an  acetate  sleeve,   I   would   adhere   a   small   strip   of   Filmoplast   P90   with   the   written   accession   number   to   the   sleeve's  corner.     After   linking   the   negative   (both   physically   and   digitally)   with   its   own   unique   number,   I   would   input   additional   information   into   the   spreadsheet.   This   list   of   fields,   developed   in   collaboration   with   Jamie   Allen,   typifies   the   kind   of   data   relevant   for   the   eventual  import  into  TMS.  It  is  as  follows:                                                                                                                                 

28  The  first  tier  reflects  the  year  the  material  was  brought  into  the  collection.  The  second  tier  is  the  sequential  

lot  number  of  that  particular  year.  The  third  tier  is  the  item  number.

Process   ­   I   used   this   field   to   differentiate   between   black   and   white   negatives   and   color  negatives.    

I  chose  a  two-tiered  box  numbering  system  so  additional  boxes  could  be  added  to  a  series   without   disrupting   or   confusing   the   global   sequence.   A   negative's   old   location   is   straightforward,   based   on   Wooters'   and   Ihrig's   box   numbering   systems.   As   stated   previously,   knowledge   of   the   objects'   old   locations   is   being   preserved   so   it   may   be   recreated   if   necessary.   Classification,   dimensions   and   medium   are   fields   in   TMS   that   contain  information  about  the  object's  physicality  and  format.     Dating  the  negatives  was  not  always  easy.  In  most  cases,  the  dates  were  recorded  on   the   negative   sleeves.   Other   times,   I   was   forced   to   estimate--due   to   the   linkage   of   the   objects'   lot  numbers   with   the   years   of   their   making.   If   I   did   not   choose   a   date,   I   would   have   no  accession  number--which  would  prevent  me  from  cataloguing  it.  As  scholarship  on  the   Mertin   Archive   advances,   my   estimates   may   prove   inaccurate,   consequently   making   the   lot   numbers   inaccurate.   It   is   my   worry   that   the   lot   numbering   schema   will,   at   best,   be   a   minor   inconvenience.   At   worst,   it   may   hinder   or   obscure   a   future   understanding   of   the   Mertin   Archive.  It  is  unclear,  at  this  stage,  what  will  be  asked  of  the  Archive  in  the  years  to  come.      The  description  and  descriptive  title  were  often  the  same  (for  example  "Christmas   tree").   For   the   sake   of   efficiency   and   completeness,   I   decided   that   more   specific   wording   would   have   to   come   later.   The   inscriptions   field   contains   any   information   physically   recorded  on  the  objects.  Primarily,  this  was  text  on  the  negative  sleeves.  Mertin  often  wrote   18  

enlarging   exposure   information   on   the   sleeves   as   a   reference   for   making   prints.   This   included  precise  information  like  color  filter  pack  numbers  and  even  small  sketches  of  how   to  dodge  and  burn  the  resulting  print.  I  also  used  the  notes  field  to  link  negatives  to  each   other.   When   I   noticed   negatives   depicting   the   same   scene,   I   would   include   the   accession   numbers  of  the  related  negatives.  While  far  from  complete,  it  was  an  easy  way  to  make  note   of  relationships  between  negatives  that  might  not  have  been  recorded  until  later.        Proceeding   with   this   workflow,   I   located   the   22   boxes   in   which   Wooters   found   negatives   from   Die   Tannenbaumserie.   I   identified   and   pulled   each   of   the   negatives,   rehoused   them   as   necessary,   numbered   and   catalogued   them.   I   placed   the   newly   catalogued  negatives  into  new  boxes.  After  filling  each  new  box,  I  arranged  the  negatives  in   ascending  order,  by  lot  number  and  item  number.  When  the  process  was  over,  I  had  located   and   catalogued   433   negatives   in   the   series.   I   then   went   back   and   rearranged   the   entire   sequence  in  ascending  numerical  order,  as  shown  on  page  55.  They  fill  8  small  boxes  (see   fig.   3).   I   cannot   claim   that   the   series   is   definitively   complete.   There   may   still   be   stray   negatives  from  this  series  hidden  in  other  boxes,  but  the  group  of  433  negatives  constitutes   the  vast  majority.        There  are,  however,  negatives  from  other  various  series  in  my  spreadsheet  as  well.   Any   negatives   from   other   series   that   I   catalogued   while   using   my   earlier   workflow   remain  in  their  original  boxes.  These  will  have   to   be   considered   at   a   later   date,   when   some   future   cataloguer   can   address   them   directly   and  place  them  in  their  appropriate  series.

However,   it   was   previously   known   that   there   would  be  limits  to  the  program's  thoroughness.   Certain  fields  of  information,  such  as  date,  medium  and  titles,  would  be  entered  only  as  free   19

Abstract         This   finding   aid   provides   information   about   the   photographer   Roger   Mertin.   Specifically,   it   deals   with   8x10   inch   negatives   he   made   during   the   course   of   his   artistic   career.   This   document   will   allow   researchers   to   find   specific   negatives   in   specific   boxes,   while  also  providing  background  information  on  the  following  series:  Die  Tannenbaumserie   and  Hoops.  In  addition  to  this  series-specific  data,  this  finding  aid  also  aims  to  contextualize   Roger   Mertin   by   including   as   much   information   about   him   as   possible.   This   includes   a   written  account  of  the  various  peregrinations  of  the  Roger  Mertin  Archive,  a  timeline  and   biography  of  his  life,  an  overview  of  his  photographic  series,  a  thorough  bibliography  and   exhaustive  listings  of  his  exhibitions  (solo  and  group),  awards,  publications  and  places  that   have  collected  his  work.        Scope  and  Content      The   Roger   Mertin   Archive   is   made   up   of   photographs,   large   format   negatives,   roll   film   negatives   and   transparencies,   slides,   polaroids,   posters,   publications,   picture   frames   and  a  variety  of  manuscript  materials.  The  manuscript  materials  consist  of  correspondence,   expense  records,  tax  records,  exhibition  catalogs  and  personal  notebooks.  Unsurprisingly,   most  of  the  Roger  Mertin  Archive  dates  from  the  1960's  through  the  end  of  the  1990's.  In   total,   it   spans   the   width   and   depth   of   Roger   Mertin's   entire   life.   There   are   approximately   23,230   photographs,   7,725   8x10   inch   negatives,   3,322   rolls   of   negative   film,   51   rolls   of   transparency   film,   10,000   slides,   254   posters,   2,020   publications   and   471   folders   of   manuscript  materials.  This  adds  up  to  nearly  50,000  objects.     Housed  in  330  boxes  before  processing,  the  Roger  Mertin  Archive  stretches  92.5  feet   (28.2   meters).   It   is   unclear   at   this   time   if   the   extent   of   the   collection   will   change   as   a   result   of  processing.  While  many  collections  shrink  as  a  result  of  more  convenient  arrangement,   properly   housing   the   prints   and   negatives   will   incrementally   increase   the   space   taken   up   by  each  item.  This  may  cause  the  Archive  to  grow  slightly  in  size  as  it  is  processed.  At  the   time  of  this  writing,  part  of  the  processing  plan  is  to  move  the  manuscript  materials  to  the   Richard  and  Ronay  Menschel  Library  at  some  later  date.     22  

Background  Note      The   material   that   comprises   the   Roger   Mertin   Archive   was,   at   one   time,   stored   together  in  Rochester.  Mertin  owned  a  house  in  downtown  Rochester,  located  at  16  Upton   Park.   The   house   is   between   East   Avenue   and   University   Avenue,   only   half   a   mile   from   George  Eastman  House  and  a  mere  700  yards  from  Visual  Studies  Workshop.  According  to   Mertin's  life  partner,  Elizabeth  Ihrig,  he  lived  on  the  second  floor  of  the  house  while  renting   out   the   first   floor.   Also   according   to   Ihrig,   Mertin   owned   the   house   next   door,   18   Upton   Park   (which,   at   one   point,   he   rented   to   a   group   of   nuns).   Any   of   his   work   that   had   not   entered  an  institutional  or  private  collection  resided  with  Mertin  at  16  Upton  Park  or  in  his   office  at  the  University  of  Rochester.        Then  in  1992,  Roger  Mertin  relocated  to  Minneapolis  to  be  with  Ihrig.  However,  he   maintained  ownership  of  his  house  in  Rochester,  where  the  bulk  of  his  material  still  resided.   It  should  be  noted  that  any  work  he  produced  while  living  in  Minneapolis  remained  there,   at   515   Fifth   Avenue   S.E.,   #6.   In   1997,   Mertin   and   Ihrig   moved   to   56   Arundel,   Saint   Paul,   Minnesota.  At  this  time,  Mertin  brought  a  portion  of  the  work  being  stored  in  Rochester  to   Saint  Paul.  The  combination  of  the  work  he  produced  since  1992  (in  the  Twin  Cities),  and   the   work   he   relocated   to   St.   Paul   in   1997,   forms   what   I   will   call   "Group   1."   Group   1   also   contained   items   that   Ihrig   gathered   after   Mertin's   death   from   scattered   dealers,   recently   printed  lab  work,  as  well  as  an  exhibition  that  was  hanging  in  a  college  gallery  forty  miles   from  their  home.  According  to  Ihrig,  Mertin  organized  most  of  Group  1  himself.        After   Mertin's   death   in   2001,   his   sister   Ruth   Meyer   collected   any   work   that   still   remained  in  Rochester  (at  his  house  and  his  office).  I  will  call  this  "Group  2."  Group  2  was   relocated   to   Meyer's   home   in   Stratford,   Connecticut.   During   this   time,   it   appears   that   artist   Michaela   Murphy   (Mertin's   former   girlfriend)   made   contact   prints   for   some   of   Mertin's   8x10   negatives.   These   prints   still   reside   with   the   negatives.   The   material   remained   in   Stratford   for   one   year,   and   then   was   moved   to   St.   Paul.   Ihrig   recounts   that   Group   2   was   stored   in   the   space   of   a   local   art   dealer,   Thomas   Barry   Fine   Arts.   Between   this   time   and   2006,  Ihrig  inventoried  Group  1.           23  

Group  1                                                                                                                                                              Group  2    -Work  made  after  1992                                                                                                    -Work  that  remained                                           -Work  Mertin  moved                                                                                                                  in  Rochester  &  was                                               to  Saint  Paul  in  1997                                                                                                                removed  by  Ruth  Meyer         In   2006,   George   Eastman   House   received   a   grant   from   the   Judith   Rothschild   Foundation  to  bring  all  of  it  back  to  Rochester.  GEH  sent  Rick  Hock  and  Sean  Corcoran  to   retrieve  it  in  its  entirety--at  the  time  of  writing,  these  men  are  now  the  Archivist  at  Visual   Studies  Workshop  and  the  Curator  of  Prints  and  Photographs  at  the  Museum  of  the  City  of   New   York,   respectively.   In   June   of   2006,   Ihrig,   Hock   and   Corcoran   loaded   Group   2   onto   a   truck.  During  this  loading  process,  Hock  and  Corcoran  created  a  checklist  for  Group  2.  The   following  day,  Group  1  was  loaded  into  the  truck.  I  have  included  Ihrig's  inventory  of  Group   1   as   an   appendix   to   this   thesis   (page   111).   The   entirety   of   the   Mertin   material   was   then   brought   to   George   Eastman   House.   When   it   arrived,   the   archivist   at   the   time,   David   Wooters,  began  to  inventory  the  material  as  one  collection.  His  inventory  is  box  level,  and   includes  tallies  for  number  of  items  in  each  box  and  basic  subjects  represented  (i.e.  trees,   portraits,  hoops,  xmas  trees,  etc).       I  was  uncertain  what  relationship  Wooters'  inventory  had  to  Elizabeth  Ihrig's.  After   speaking   with   her   and   examining   her   inventory,   it   is   clear   that   they   are   different   documents.   Group   1   and   Group   2   are   now   the   "Roger   Mertin   Archive."   It   appears   that   Wooters  used  Ihrig's  inventory  to  guide  the  creation  of  his  own.  He  preserves  some  of  the   box  designations  that  she  uses,  such  as  "N"  for  negatives  and  "P"  for  prints.  Wooters  made  a   number   of   alterations   to   Group   1's   ordering.   He   also   records   different   information   about   each  box  (or  binder),  such  as  precise  tallies.  When  comparing  both  inventories  line-by-line,   it  is  not  immediately  clear  that  they  refer  to  the  same  boxes--however,  I  believe  they  do  in   the   majority   of   cases.   Wooters   also   inventoried   what   use   to   be   Group   2.   Ihrig   did   not   inventory  Group  2,   thus   Wooters'  document  is  the  first  of  its  kind.  In  it,  he  does  not  use  the   N  or  P  designations.  Based  on  the  imprecise  overlap  between  the  two  inventories,  it  may  be   possible,   theoretically,   to   separate   Group   1   and   2   again.   However,   I   do   not   believe   the   benefits  of  doing  so  are  proportionate  to  the  resources  required,  both  in  time  and  space.        24

Biography      Roger   Mertin   was   born   in   Bridgeport,   Connecticut   on   December   9th,   1942.   His   picture   making   began   as   a   teenager,   after   receiving   an   Ansco   camera   as   a   Christmas   gift   from   his   parents.   His   experimentation   with   this   camera,   and   the   darkroom   he   eventually   set  up  in  his  house,  led  him  to  join  a  camera  club  in  Milford,  Connecticut.  While  in  his  school   library,   Mertin   found   a   series   of   brochures   on   career   possibilities   (one   of   which   was   photography)   published   by   the   Rochester   Institute   of   Technology.   After   graduating   from   high  school  in  Stratford  in  1960,  he  attended  the  University  of  Bridgeport  for  a  single  year.   In  the  fall  of  1961,  Mertin  was  enrolled  at  the  Rochester  Institute  of  Technology  as  a   sophomore.   In   an   interview   conducted   by   William   Johnson   and   Susie   Cohen,   Mertin   describes   himself   during   his   first   year   at   RIT   as   "your   average   college   student   who   was   adrift."29  However,   something   changed   during   his   second   year.   Mertin   recounts   a   story   of   a   RIT  photography  professor  named  Neil  Croom,  who  writes  a  small  note  to  him,  saying  he  is   not   working   hard   enough.   The   combination   of   this   quiet   indictment,   a   photography   workshop   with   Minor   White,   the   greater   availability   of   photography   books   (specifically   those   of   Harry   Callahan)   and   the   presence   of   a   steady   girlfriend   named   Joan   Schultz   all   focused  the  young  Roger  Mertin  on  the  task  of  making  successful  photographs.   The   following   year   at   RIT,   Mertin   took   his   first   workshop   with   Nathan   Lyons.   Lyons   was  working  at  George  Eastman  House  at  the  time,  and  taught  workshops  for  different  skill   levels  out  of  his  home  on  Rutgers  Street.  It  was  also  during  this  time  that  Mertin  completed   a   photographic   history   course   at   GEH   taught   by   Beaumont   Newhall.30  In   1965,   Mertin   graduated  from  RIT  with  a  Bachelor  of  Fine  Arts  degree  in  photography.  His  senior  thesis   was   called   A   Study   of   Architectural   Ornamentation.   It   comprised   forty-four   gelatin   silver   prints   now   housed   at   the   Visual   Studies   Workshop,   also   in   Rochester,   New   York.   By   this   time,  he  had  married  Joan  Schultz,  who  was  also  the  subject  of  many  of  his  early  portraits,   including   the   series   One:   A   Selection   of   Nudes   and   a   previously   unknown   maquette   titled   "Joan."  Mertin  secured  a  full  time  job  at  Kodak  testing  potential  consumer  products,  while

he   assisted   Nathan   Lyons   with   workshops   and  photographed  on  the  weekends.31   Mertin   was   hired   as   a   photography   technician   at   GEH   in   1966.   This   granted   him   access   to   original   prints   while   generating   copy   negatives   of   the   museum's   holdings.   He  worked  at  GEH  for  three  years,  and  came   into  contact  with  artists  like  Robert  Fichter,   Thomas   Barrow   and   future   curator   Robert   Sobieszek   (who   at   the   time   was   a   Stanford   graduate   student   taking   a   summer   workshop   with   Lyons).      In   these   years   he   also  made  the  photographs  that  would  later   be   published   with   the   name   Plastic   Love   Dream.   An   image   from   this   series   would   go   on  to  be  published  in  The  Print,  part  of  the  well-known  Life  Library  of  Photography.32     Mertin  realized  earlier  than  his  contemporaries  that  to  teach  photography  he  would   need   a   graduate   degree.   In   the   spring   of   1969,   he   enrolled   in   Lyons'   new   program--then   known  as  the  Photographic  Studies  Workshop.  It  was  affiliated  with  the  SUNY  Buffalo  Art   Department,   and   in   its   second   year   changed   its   name   to   Visual   Studies   Workshop.   From   1969  into  the  early  1970s,  Mertin  worked  as  an  adjunct  faculty  member  at  RIT  while  also   co-founding   and   running   a   firm   called   the   Walrus   Company,   which   specialized   in   slide   reproductions  of  photographs.  In  1970,  he  began  his  project  of  photographing  trees,  with   35mm  black  and  white  film  and  flash.  In  1972,  Mertin  received  a  Master  of  Fine  Arts  degree   in  photographic  studies  with  the  completion  of  his  final  thesis,   23   Couples,  at  VSW.  Mertin   and  Schultz  ended  their  marriage  in  1972.  That  summer,  he  was  a  visiting  instructor  for  a   summer   class   at   the   San   Francisco   Art   Institute,   as   well   as   a   Visiting   Professor   of   Art   at   the   University  of  New  Mexico  in  Albuquerque.     Mertin   began   working   as   a   photography   instructor   at   the   University   of   Rochester   in

1973.   In   the   same   year,   Mertin   also   completed   a   little-known   project   with   photographer   and  friend  Michael  Becotte.  Kodak  paid  for  a  road  trip  that  Mertin  and  Becotte  took  across   the   country,   shooting   with   110-format   color   roll   film.   Kodak   wished   to   demonstrate   the   enlarging  capability  of  their  110-format  film--so  as  to  encourage  consumer  confidence-- while  also  supporting  local  photographers.  The  following  year  their  work  was  exhibited  at   George   Eastman   House   (which   comprised   over   250   photographs,   printed   by   Kodak)   with   the  exhibition  title  Road  Shots.     In   1974,   Roger   Mertin   was   awarded   the   John   Simon   Guggenheim   Memorial   Foundation  Fellowship  for  Photography.  This  recognition  bolstered  his  career  even  further.   In   his   proposal,   he   discusses   his   desire   to   photograph   trees   in   a   "transitional   landscape,"   while   developing   "a   concept   of   portrait   as   it   might   relate   to   trees"   (see   page   96).   Despite   being   typically   vague,   it   highlights   a   concern   that   permeates   the   entirety   of   Mertin's   career--a   sharply   honed   focus   on   the   way   an   object   influences   the   environment   where   humans  confront  it  (both  physically  and  psychologically).   There   was   a   fundamental   shift   in   the   art   making   of   Roger   Mertin   when   he   began   using  an  8x10  inch  view  camera  in  1975.  Multiple  people  had  suggested  to  Mertin  that  he   change  to  large  format--Harry  Callahan  in  1966,  Thomas  Barrow  in  1970,  John  Szarkowski   in  the  early  1970s  and  finally  Michaela  Murphy  in  1975.33  He  split  the  cost  of  the  camera   with  Murphy  (his  girlfriend  at  the  time).  The  increased  resolution,  the  greater  demand  for   formal   rigor   and   the   unique   spatial   renderings   of   such   a   large   lens   were   all   factors   that   made  Mertin's  shift  to  large  format  nearly  unavoidable.  The  results  from  the  large  camera   were  more  consistent  with  his  goals  as  a  photographer,  while  the  apparatus  itself  changed   his   relationship   to   the   subjects   in   front   of   his   lens.   His   first   formal   experiments   with   Christmas   trees   were   made   in   1975.   The   following   year,   he   photographed   the   landscape   of   downtown  Hailey,  Idaho,  triggering  the  original  idea  that  led  to  his  typological  series,   Die   Tannenbaumserie--a  large  body  of  work  depicting  Christmas  trees  and  holiday  decorations.   It   may   have   been   this   typological   working   method   that   led   him   to   photograph   basketball   hoops  from  1977  to  1980  with  similar  insistence  and  dedication.   1978   was   an   important   year   for   Roger   Mertin.   His   work   was   shown   in   two

important   exhibitions.   First   was   Roger  Mertin:  Records  1976-78,   at   the   Chicago   Center   for   Contemporary  Photography.34  The  show  presented  an  overview  of  Mertin's  work,  including   trees,   hoops,   portraits   and   Christmas   trees.   The   80   photographs   in   the   exhibition   were   8x10   inch   contact   prints--specifically   gelatin   printing-out   prints,   or   "POPs,"   toned   with   gold  chloride  (giving  them  a  purplish-red  color).35  The  catalog's  essay,  written  by  Charles   Desmarais,   establishes   Mertin   as   a   torchbearer   for   a   particular   photographic   style,   exemplified  by  Eugène  Atget  and  Walker  Evans.  According  to  Desmarais:    
   It's  not  only  that  each  [Atget  and  Evans]  was  a  documentarian  of  his  culture  (a  great   many  people  have  attempted  that),  but  each  of  them  found  a  way  to  inject  into  his   pictures  the  suggestion  of  a  personal  truth  that  paralleled  the  half-truths  described   by   the   lens...   There   is   no   such   thing   as   objectivity.   There's   no   such   thing   as   perfection.  Mertin  shows  that  it  is  possible  to  know  these  things,  accept  them,  and   love  them  about  the  world.36     

The   second   was   Mirrors   and   Windows:   American   Photography   since   1960,   one   of   John  Szarkowski's  better-known  photography  exhibitions  at  the  Museum  of  Modern  Art  in   New  York.  Mertin's  inclusion  in  Szarkowski's  show,  and  resulting  book,  indicates  the  kind   of   recognition   his   name   accorded   by   this   time.   Two   of   Mertin's   photographs   were   included   in   the   exhibition--Casual   Heart   #1 37   and   Tree,   Rochester,   New   York   (1973).   Both   photographs   were   included   in   the   book's   first   section.   This   first   part   exemplifies   Szarkowski's   "mirrors,"   or   photographs   that   function   primarily   as   distillations   of   introspective  analysis.  Also  in  1978,  Mertin  received  a  grant  from  the  National  Endowment   for  the  Arts,  for  a  group  project  called   From  This  Land,  a  photographic  survey  dealing  with   the  impact  of  mining  on  the  landscape.38   The   next   professionally   significant   achievement   for   Mertin   was   his   commission   to                                                                                                                   
34  Founded  in  1976  by  Columbia  College  Chicago,  the  CCCP  was  succeeded  by  the  MoCP  (the  Museum  of  

Contemporary  Photography)  in  1984.   35  Candida  Finkel,  "McPherson,  Mertin  featured  in  summer  show,"  Afterimage  (October  1978):  19.   36  Roger  Mertin  and  Charles  Desmarais,  Roger  Mertin:  Records  1976-78  (Chicago:  Chicago  Center  for   Contemporary  Photography,  1978).   37  According  to  an  interview  conducted  by  Gary  Metz  in  1981,  Mertin  considered  this  photograph  one  of  his   best  photographs  from  Plastic  Love  Dream.     38  This  group  project  was  conceived  by  Richard  "Sandy"  Hume  and  also  included  photographers  Robert   Adams,  Linda  Conner,  Ronald  Wholauer,  Richard  van  Pelt  and  Barbara  Houghton.

photograph   the   festivities   surrounding   Rochester's   sesquicentennial   in   1984.   This   color   work   includes   portraits   of   people   in   costume,   examples   of   children's   artwork,   replicas   of   historic   buildings   on   barges   along   the   Erie   Canal,   images   (maybe   a   typology?)   of   historic   markers   throughout   Rochester,   festival   markets   and   more.   Also   in   1984,   Mertin's   photographs   were   reproduced   in   Sally   Eauclaire's   New   Color/New   Work:   Eighteen   Photographic   Essays   --   along   with   distinguished   company   like   Stephen   Shore,   William   Eggleston,  Joel  Meyerowitz,  Mitch  Epstein  and  others.  Her  essay,  "The  Blues,"  (also  Mertin's   title   for   the   series)   describes   his   use   of   tungsten-balanced   color   film   in   daylight,   which   imparted  intensity  of  blue  that  Eauclaire  equates  with  various  mental  states.       
Despite  some  intimations  of  the  "blue  devils"  of  depression,  many  of  the  works  are   witty.   But   their   humor   is   the   brittle   kind   designed   to   stave   off   tragedy,   as   in   the   novels   of   Milan   Kundera...   Through   the   snapshot   aesthetic,   Mertin--like   the   protagonist   in   The  Joke--"realized   that   things   conceived   by   errors   were   every   bit   as   real  as  things  conceived  by  reason  and  necessity."...Through  relentless  photographic   cataloging,   Mertin   has   found   a   personal   means   of   attaining   meaning   and   remembrance  in  what  Kundera  has  called  our  "world  of  accelerating  forgetting."39     

  

In  1986,  Mertin  began  photographing  the  Statue  of  Liberty  and  Ellis  Island  with  his  

8x10   view   camera.   Two   years   later,   he   became   part   of   The   Ellis   Island   Artifact   Project.   Headed   by   Montclair   State   College   photography   professor   Klaus   Schnitzer,   the   project   sought   to   examine   Ellis   Island   and   its   "mystery   of   memory   and   time."40  Two   of   Mertin's   photographs  were  subsequently  published  in  one  of  the  project's  incarnations,   Ellis  Island:   Echoes  from  a  Nation's  Past  (1989),  a  book  produced  by  Aperture.        In   1991,   he   had   a   major   exhibition,   O  Tannenbaum,  O  Christmas  Tree,   at   the   National   Gallery   of   Canada   in   Ottawa.   The   National   Gallery's   Curator   of   Photographs,   James   Borcoman,   wrote   the   essay   accompanying   the   exhibition.   Borcoman   championed   Mertin   and  his  photographs,  so  much  so  that  the  National  Gallery  has  the  second  largest  holdings   of   Mertin   photographs,   after   George   Eastman   House.   In   his   essay,   Borcoman   keenly

analyzes  Mertin's  series  Die  Tannenbaumserie:       
Undoubtedly,  there  is  an  appeal  to  childhood  memories  of  excitement  and  wonder   in   these   photographs.   We   may   also   see   them   as   anthropological   studies,   for   what   could   more   appropriately   symbolize   Middle   America   than   all   this   glitter   and   tinsel   with   its   emphasis   on   material   abundance...   But   there   is   more   to   Mertin's   photographs  than  a  homage  to  memories  or  a  cataloguing  of  facts.  Mertin  is  out  to   give   us   the   whole   truth--great   cornucopias   of   irrelevant   things...   These   photographs   are   not   of   trees   only,   but   of   spaces.   Spaces   dense   with   information,   a   kind  of  information  to  which  the  eye  is  often  inured...   The  photographs  tell  us  about   the   act   of   looking.   In   a   sense,   they   are   also   Mertin's   gift   to   us,   above   all   a   gift   of   discovery.       

In  the  same  year,  Mertin's  photographs  appeared  in  an  exhibition  at  the  Newport  Harbor   Art   Museum   (in   Newport   Beach,   California),   titled   Typologies:   Nine   Contemporary   Photographers.   The   other   photographers   were   Bernd   &   Hilla   Becher,   Lynne   Cohen,   Judy   Fiskin,   Candida   Hofer,   Thomas   Ruff,   Ed   Ruscha   and   Thomas   Struth.   Again,   a   list   of   such   prominent   names   says   something   about   Mertin's   recognition,   at   least   from   curators   drawn   to  his  era  of  photography.     By  this  time,  Mertin  had  begun  his  last  major  typological  series,  one  that  he  would   continue   throughout   the   final   decade   of   his   life.      He   chose   libraries   as   his   subjects-- specifically  those  funded  by  Andrew  Carnegie  between  1886  and  191741.  He  met  Elizabeth   Ihrig  for  the  first  time  in  the  summer  of  1991,  while  pursuing  the  project.  At  the  time,  she   was   the   librarian   at   The   Bakken   Library.42  When   a   friend   suggested   The   Bakken   as   a   possible   subject   (despite   not   being   a   Carnegie   library),   Mertin   made   an   appointment   and   was   given   a   guided   tour   of   the   facilities   by   Ihrig.   During   the   course   of   their   initial   conversation,   Ihrig   suggested   that   Mertin   apply   for   a   small   travel   grant   that   was   administered  through  the  Bakken.  According  to  Ihrig,  Mertin  did  apply,  and  returned  to  the   library  again  in  October  of  that  year  as  the  recipient.  Mertin  notes  in  his  curriculum  vitae                                                                                                                   
41  Mertin   received   a   McKnight   Foundation   Artist   Fellowship   for   photography   in   1999   that   allowed   him   to  

continue  working  on  the  library  series.

that  he  was  a  "Visiting  Scholar"  at  the  Bakken.  Ihrig  concluded  her  telling  of  her  first  chance   meeting   with   Mertin   in   this   way:   "Serendipity!   All   the   way   through--the   first   law   of   research  and  library  reference--it  served  us  well!"43   In   1992,   Mertin   moved   to   Minneapolis   to   be   with   Ihrig.   While   this   was   not   the   beginning   of   his   artistic   relationship   with   the   city   of   Minneapolis,   moving   there   strengthened  this  connection.  He  was  a  well-known  figure  in  the  photography  scene  of  the   Twin   Cities,   even   influencing   the   aesthetics   of   a   young   Alec   Soth. 44   It   should   be   remembered   that   Mertin   was   still   a   faculty   member   at   the   University   of   Rochester.   According   to   Ihrig,   Mertin   travelled   back   and   forth   from   Rochester   to   Minneapolis   very   frequently--often  by  boat  or  plane.  However,  in  1997,  Mertin  relocated,  with  Ihrig,  to  the   city  of  Saint  Paul.  Despite  still  commuting  back  and  forth  to  Rochester,  Mertin  transferred  a   large  portion  of  his  archive  to  Saint  Paul  when  he  moved  there.        Mertin  continued  to  make  work  and  teach  at  the  University  of  Rochester.  While  in   conversation  with  Roger  Bruce  (former  employee  of  George  Eastman  House  and  longtime   friend   of   Mertin),   he   stated   that   Mertin   had   great   personal   difficulties   when   it   came   to   teaching.  Bruce  said  that  teaching  did  not  come  naturally  or  easily  to  him.  Instead,  Mertin   taught  by  example.  According  to  Carl  Chiarenza,  fellow  photographer  and  colleague  at  the   University  of  Rochester,  Mertin  "taught  as  a  practicing  artist--by  example,  revealing  what  a   commitment   to   making   art   is   all   about."45  On   May   6th,   2001,   Roger   Mertin   died   suddenly   at   his  home  in  Rochester,  at  the  age  of  58.  Having  no  children  of  his  own,  he  was  survived  by   his  sister  Ruth  Meyer  and  two  nieces,  as  well  as  his  life  partner  Elizabeth  Ihrig.     The  executive  director  of  Light  Work  in  Syracuse,  Jeffrey  Hoone,  referred  to  Roger   Mertin   as   the   "master   of   the   understated   eloquence   of   vernacular   photography."46  In   a   statement  of  remembrance,  and  in  the  voice  of  a  friend,  he  says  that:

Although   Roger   worked   primarily   with   an   8x10   view   camera   and   photographed   things   out   in   the   world   the   way   he   found   them--he   wasn't   a   documentary   photographer  in  the  tradition  that  his  tools  and  techniques  suggest.  Most  of  Roger's   work   had   a   strong   conceptual   base   but   his   sense   of   humor   and   the   importance   he   placed  on  small  details  prevented  his  work  from  being  caught  in  a  static  theoretical   framework...  Roger's  pictures,  more  than  any  other  artist,  got  me  to  pay  attention,  to   really  understand  how  to  look  at  a  picture  and  understand  what  I  was  seeing.47

Series  Description   Series  1:  Die  Tannenbaumserie  (boxes  1-1  through  1-8)      The  negatives  from  Mertin's   Die   Tannenbaumserie  span  twenty  years  (1975-1995).  

The  final  resulting  group,  totaling  433,  is  stored  in  eight  archival  boxes.  They  are  arranged   in   numerically   ascending   order   by   lot   number,   and   subsequently   by   item   number.   Throughout   the   course   of   the   processing,   it   became   clear   that   this   body   of   work   did   not   only  include  Christmas  trees,  but  any  sort  of  visual  representation  of  decorated  trees--be  it   through  Christmas  lights,  drawings  or  other  mass-produced  decorations.  A  large  number  of   the   images   were   made   within   the   domestic   space   of   homes,   but   there   are   also   negatives   showing   Christmas   trees   (or   representations   of   them)   in   public   spaces.   This   project   was   carried  out  in  color  as  well  as  black  and  white.  Many  of  the  domestic  spaces  shown  in  the   negatives  appear  over  the  course  of  multiple  years.

Series  2:  Hoops  (boxes  2-1  through  2-11)      The   negatives   from   the   Hoops   series   span   four   years   (1977-1980).   The   final  

resulting   group,   totaling   417,   is   stored   in   eleven   archival   boxes.   They   are   arranged   in   numerically   ascending   order   by   lot   number,   and   subsequently   by   item   number.   Despite   purchasing   his   8x10   Deardorff   camera   in   1975,   Mertin   had   clearly   mastered   this   tool   by   1977.   The   Hoops   series   showcases   basketball   hoops.   Found   in   various   places,   the   hoops   appear   to   function   as   useful   (and   plentiful)   catalysts--a   category   of   mundane   objects   deliberately   and   consciously   chosen   to   trigger   the   photograph-making   process.   One   prevalent   formal   strategy   entails   placing   the   basketball   hoop,   as   an   element   in   the   photograph,   in   front   of   a   tree   with   branches   spreading   upwards.   The   branches   serve   as   graphical   lines   that   either   spring   out   of   the   hoop,   or,   in   reverse,   are   sucked   down   within   it.   The  majority  of  the  photographs  appear  to  be  "landscapes-with-basketball-hoops."

Conclusion         One   goal   of   this   project   has   been   to   increase   access   to   the   Roger   Mertin   Archive.   Another  goal  has  been  to  establish  a  methodology  by  which  to  organize  the  Archive  in  the   future.   The   size   of   the   Roger   Mertin   Archive   prevented   me   from   accounting   for   all   of   the   material.   Such   an   undertaking   will   require   much   time   and   many   hands.   However,   this   project   marks   a   strong   beginning   to   this   long   procedure.   Assigning   accession   numbers   to   the   negatives   allows   the   tracking   and   description   of   each   one.   The   arrangement   of   the   material   into   distinct   bodies   of   work   will   allow   for   a   more   careful   examination   of   Roger   Mertin  as  an  artist  and  photographer.  As  the  Roger  Mertin  Archive  becomes  better  known,   historians   and   researchers   will   go   to   the   photographs   first.   The   Archive's   arrangement   will   provide   the   ideal   environment   to   study   the   artistic   legacy   of   Roger   Mertin.   The   loosely   chronological  groupings  within  each  body  of  work  have  begun  the  process  of  establishing  a   more  exemplary  arrangement.   There   was   the   additional   objective   to   build   upon   the   previously   gathered   sources   relating  to  the  life  and  work  of  Roger  Mertin.  Following  the  threads  of  previous  research  to   their  ends  and  pulling  harder  have  achieved  this.  I  had  the  luxury  of  grounding  my  research   in  the  physical  objects.  This  allowed  me  to  clean  up  existing  data,  while  distilling  it  into  a   more  understandable  and  more  readable  format.  This  also  results  in  greater  access  to  the   Archive--by   providing   greater   access   to   the   facts   surrounding   it.   With   the   information   gathered   so   far,   a   prospective   researcher   can   better   triangulate   his   or   her   desired   entry   point  into  the  Archive.     As   stated   previously,   this   finding   aid   and   thesis   will   function   as   the   document   of   primary   reference   to   those   who   wish   to   explore   the   photographs   or   those   who   wish   to   persevere   in   the   cataloguing   of   the   Archive--until   such   time   as   there   is   a   more   complete   document.  The  goal  is  nothing  less  than  to  fill  in  a  gap  of  photographic  history.  I  intended  to   leave   this   project   open-ended,   in   the   hopes   that   others   will   come   after   me   to   complete   this   very  worthwhile  and  rewarding  endeavor.  Of  this  I  am  confident.

   D.  Donations      3.  Roger  Mertin  Archive--Gift  of  Ruth  Meyer      (American,  1942-2001)      Roger  Mertin  died  mid-career  in  May  of  2001  at  the  age  of  58.  He  had  been  a  member  of  the   fine  arts  faculty  at  the  University  of  Rochester  since  1972  and  a  consistently  prolific  image- maker  throughout  his  career.  Mertin  was  the  recipient  of  fellowships  from  the  Guggenheim   Foundation,  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Arts,  the  New  York  State  Council  on  the  Arts,   the  McKnight  Foundation,  and  others.  His  work  has  been  featured  in  dozens  of  exhibitions   throughout  the  United  States  (over  30  of  them  were  solo  or  two  person  shows)  and  is  in  the   permanent  collections  of  26  major  museums  and  cultural  archives.        Mertin  was  a  significant  innovator  in  both  photographic  technology  and  its  ideas.  He   pioneered  the  return  to  large  format  and  initiated  the  use  of  dual,  staggered  flash,  a   practice  now  so  ubiquitous  as  to  go  unnoticed.  He  was  also  one  of  the  first  photographic   artists  to  work  in  conceptual  series.  His  photographs  of  basketball  hoops  in  situ,  an   extended  series  of  images  of  Christmas  decorations,  the  façades  and  internal  architecture   of  rural  libraries,  and  a  series  of  pictures  of  curiously  anthropomorphic,  urban  and   suburban  trees--all  coined  idioms  defined  in  the  particulars  and  specificity  of  large  format   photography.      Despite  this,  Mertin's  work  is  not  widely  recognized  beyond  that  community  of  curators   and  artists  who  trace  their  careers  to  enthusiasms  of  the  1970s  and  1980s.  The  reason  for   this  eclipse  is  central  to  our  interest  in  the  mertin  archive  and  Mertin's  career.  It   exemplifies  a  brief  epoch  in  the  practice  of  fine  art  photography--a  practice  that  prefigures   the  surpassing  ubiquity  of  postmodern  camera  work.  It  can  be  argued  that  Mertin  is  the   perfect  embodiment  of  the    art  making  that  originated  inside  photography.  At  the  cusp  of   the  first  generation  of  photographers  to  obtain  an  MFA  in  photography,  Mertin  entered  the   field  while  the  discipline  was  still  in  a  state  of  self-remediation,  struggling  for  recognition  in   the  academy.  An  explosive  recognition  was  soon  to  occur  in  an  unanticipated  form:  from   artists  who  chose  to  use  photography  as  a  device  for  quotation.  But  this  was  decidedly  not   the  central  project  of  Roger  Mertin's  career.  Mertin's  photography  took  him  directly  to   objects  in  the  world.  His  particular  genius  was  the  ability  to  see  and  trace  the  thread  of  a   visual  idiom  through  the  American  social  landscape.        We  believe  that  the  work  of  this  important  artist,  belongs  in  the  Eastman  House  collection   for  reasons  that  derive  from  our  collection  and  the  important  position  of  this  artist  in  the

history  of  photography.  We  anticipate  an  eventual  retrospective  and  publication  that  will   permanently  place  Mertin's  work  in  the  trajectory  of  the  photograph  as  art.      The  Roger  Mertin  Archive  includes  not  only  prints  and  negatives,  but  slides,   correspondence,  and    publications.  The  photographic  prints  number  23,  194  which   accompany  7,685  8x10-inch  negatives  and  3,321  roll  film  negatives.  A  basic  inventory  of   the  items  has  now  been  completed  for  acquisition  purposes.  We  look  forward  to  working   with  these  materials  in  the  future  to  provide  access  for  researchers  and  to  use  them  within   our  own  exhibitions.      In  2007  the  Acquisitions  Committee  voted  to  accept  this  collection  in  its  entirety  on   principal,  with  formal  application  to  the  full  board  tooccur  as  soon  as  an  inventory  has  been   completed.         A  full  inventory  will  be  available  at  the  acquisitions  meeting  for  those  interested.  An   extended  bio  follows:      Roger  Mertin  was  born  in  Bridgeport,  CT  on  December  9th,  1942.  According  to  Mertin,  he   became  seriously  interested  in  photography  in  1963.  At  this  time,  he  was  a  sophomore  at   RIT  and  sought  out  photography  workshops  with  Nathan  Lyons  and  Minor  White.  In  1964   he  married  Joan  Schultz,  the  subject  of  many  of  his  early  photographic  projects.  He  received   his  bachelor  of  fine  arts  degree  from  RIT  in  1965,  and  his  senior  thesis  Architectural   Ornamentation  was  exhibited  that  year  at  George  Eastman  House.  He  was  part  of  the   exhibition  Photography  65  that  year,  and  was  featured  in  a  one-man  show  at  George   Eastman  House  in  1966.  During  1965  and  1966  he  worked  as  a  photo  technician  at   Eastman  Kodak.      Mertin  was  hired  in  the  darkroom  at  George  Eastman  House  in  1966,  and  was  head  of  the   reproduction  center  by  1967.  In  1968  and  1969  he  worked  as  assistant  curator  of   "extension  activities"  at  George  Eastman  House.  In  1969  he  founded  a  slide  reproduction   business  with  Michael  Becotte,  which  they  called  the  Walrus;  they  dissolved  the  business  in   1974.      Mertin  entered  the  Visual  Studies  Workshop  (VSW)  in  1969.  That  first  year,  VSW  did  not   officially  offer  graduate  prograpms;  known  then  as  the  Photographic  Studies  Workshop,  it   offered  informal  workshops  but  granted  no  degrees.  In  1970  the  institution  became   affiliated  with  SUNY  Buffalo  and  began  offering  the  MFA  degree.  Mertin  was  in  the  first   group,  graduating  in  1972.  He  served  as  a  graduate  teaching  assistant  during  his  first  year   at  VSW,  and  an  adjunct  faculty  member  at  RIT  from  1969  to  1972.  He  and  Joan  were   divorced  in  1972.      After  short  term  teaching  positions  at  the  San  Francisco  Art  Institute  and  the  University  of   New  Mexico,  Mertin  was  hired  as  an  instructor  of  photography  at  the  University  of   Rochester  in  1973.  In  the  next  decade  he  was  a  visiting  artist  at  schools  in  such  places  as   New  York,  Colorado,  Michigan,  Idaho,  Minnesota,  and  Virgina  and  taught  summer   67  

workshops  in  North  Caroloina,  Colorado,  California,  and  New  Mexico.  He  traveled   continuously,  photographing,  teaching,  and  presenting  his  work  around  the  U.S.  and   Canada.  Friends  remember  that  he  drove  everywhere;  he  would  drive  across  the  country   even  for  a  weekend  Society  for  Photographic  Education  (SPE)  conference.      Travel  was,  in  fact,  the  major  vehicle  for  communication  for  Mertin.  Refering  to  Mertin's   practice  of  correspondence  while  he  was  on  the  road,  Heidi  Katz  explained,  "once  he  left   town  he  was  in  touch."  He  sent  frequent,  sometimes  weekly  postcards  or  photographs   enclosed  with  brief,  sometimes  ambiguous,  usually  entertaining  messages,  leaving  many  of   his  friends  and  fellow  photographers  at  the  time  with  collections  of  correspondence.  He   photographed  constantly;  if  he  wasn't  working  formally,  he  was  making  snapshots  of   everyone  and  everything  around  him.  The  act  of  photographing,  and  the  images  that   resulted,  were  his  means  of  communicating  with  the  world.      Mertin  worked  at  the  University  of  Rochester  until  his  death  in  2001.  He  was  essentially  the   only  photography  instructor  on  staff,  though  there  were  occasional  adjuncts.  He  was  active   in  the  department,  frequently  curating  exhibitions  at  the  Hartnett  Gallery  in  Wilson   Commons.  He  curated  exhibition  of  work  by  Atget,  Friedlander,  Jerome  Liebling,  and  others.   For  many  years  he  was  represented  by  the  Visual  Studies  Workshop  Gallery,  and   showed/sold  prints  through  light  Gallery  in  New  York  City  in  the  1970s.  Mertin's  friends   insist  that  he  was  always  ahead  of  the  trends.  He  experimented  with  hand-help  plash  at   night  until  too  many  other  photographers  began  to  copy  him,  he  began  shooting  with  a   large  format  view  camera  before  that  became  trendy,  and  he  made  20x24-inch  Polaroids   before  they  were  widely  popular.      Mertin  photographed  typical  American  subjects,  and  included  the  phrase  "American   photographer"  in  his  artist  statement.  He  focused  on  trees,  basketball  hoops,  basketball   players,  baseball  players,  libraries,  dogs,  friends,  Ellis  Island  and  the  Statue  of  Liberty,  and   Christmas  trees  and  decorations.  Other  photographers  have  portrayed  such  objects  in  a   more  sarcastic,  sardonic  way,  poking  fun  at  the  excess  of  America.  Mertins  images  do  not   carry  this  tone.  He  approached  his  subjects  with  an  honest  curiosity  and  gentle  observation.   He  placed  all  of  his  subjects  in  the  center  of  the  frame,  at  eye  level,  without  judgment.      Mertin  met  Elizabeth  Ihrig  while  working  on  his  Library  series  in  Minnesota.  In  his  last   decade,  he  commuted  frequently  between  Rochester  and  their  home  in  St.  Paul.  According   to  Allen  Topolski,  Mertin  went  to  St.  Paul  every  other  weekend,  often  driving  himself.  He   had  become  more  and  more  active  in  the  Twin  cities  photography  scene  in  the  late  1990s,   showing  his  work  and  speaking  to  students  at  the  University  of  Minnesota.  Mertin's  friends   all  agree  that  he  wanted  to  find  a  way  to  live  in  Minnesota  full  time,  but  any  plans  he  might   have  made  were  never  carried  out.      There  were  memorial  exhibitions  in  Rochester  at  the  Hartnett  Gallery,  and  in  Minneapolis   at  the  pARTS  Gallery.  The  photographs  in  the  Rochester  exhibition  were  all  from  the   private  collections  of  Mertin's  friends  and  colleagues.  The  U  of  R  now  offers  the  annual   Roger  Mertin  Memorial  Prize  for  Excellence  in  Studio  Art,  a  scholarship  fund  for   outstanding  undergraduate  students.   68

   In  late  2001,  I    made  a  list  of  Roger's  work  in  our  St.  Paul  home  for  estate  purposes  and  I've   updated  it  a  few  times  since  then,  as  other  things  turned  up  or  shifted  position  as  a  result  of   the  posthumous  pARTs  show  in  2001  and  my  working  on  a  partial  prints  inventory  from   2003-2006.    The  few  glitches  in  numbering  that  appear  arose  as  I  worked  more  closely   with  these  materials  over  the  past  five  years,  but  those  glitches  are  pointed  out  and   explained  in  the  text.    The  most  recent  additions  and  update  took  place  as  staff  from   Eastman  House  and  I  packed  these  items  for  shipment  to  Rochester  on  June  6,  2006.    The   version  here  lists  all  the  items  from  56  Arundel  trucked  to  Rochester.      There  are  three  "series"  in  this  inventory:    "N"  (negatives,  etc.),  "P"  (prints,  etc.)  and  "F"   (framed  pictures).    The  labels  on  the  boxes  themselves  contain  one  of  these  three  letters.    In   this  way,  the  works  that  Roger  brought  to  our  St.  Paul  home  from  Rochester  in  the  late   1990s,  or  the  work  he  generated  and  kept  here,  are  distinguished  from  the  work  he  left  in   Rochester  and  that  remained  there  at  the  time  of  his  death.    His  sister,  Ruth  Meyer,   gathered  and  transported  the  Rochester  material  to  Stratford,  CT  in  2001;  in  April  2002,   she  transported  it  to  Minneapolis,  where  it  was  stored  in  the  vault  at  Thomas  Barry  Fine   Arts.    The  labeling  on  the  boxes  from  the  Barry  vault  do  not  contain  any  letters,  so  they  may   be  distinguished  in  that  way  from  the  St.  Paul  items.      I  worked  on  making  an  inventory  of  images,  beginning  in  2003,  and  managed  to  make   rough,  annotated  lists  of  the  contents  of  about  half  the  prints  boxes  at  our  home,   necessarily  focusing  on  those  from  the  time  Roger  and  I  lived  together,  or  from  the  few   years  before  we  met,  but  with  which  I  gained  some  familiarity  in  our  life  together.    They  are   only  rough  lists,  but  may  be  useful  when  proper  cataloguing  is  undertaken  on  the  collection.     On  this  box-level  inventory  I've  indicated  by  a  note  those  boxes  for  which  a  print  inventory   exists    ---  Elizabeth  Ihrig,  June  8,  2006.      Italics  indicate  the  actual  words  of  the  labels,  mostly  in  Roger  Mertin's  (RM)  hand  or     punched  in  tape  by  him;  labels  provided  by  me  (EI)  are  usually  so  noted.

Between  then  and  the  time  he  died,  Roger  spent  many  hours  at  the  MIA   reviewing  and  sorting  those  prints.    We  brought  most  of  them  home  before  May  2001.     He  mentioned  to  me  in  the  spring  of  2001  that  the  three  boxes  left  to  fetch  home  (#'s   96,  97,  and  98)  were  what  he  considered  to  be  the  cream  of    the  crop  insofar  as  those   subject  areas  were  concerned;  he  left  them  there  because  he  planned  to  discuss  them   with  the  curators  at  MIA.    He  had  ideas  for  a  show  or  books,  or  both.    I  brought  these   boxes  home  after  he  died.  --  EI
