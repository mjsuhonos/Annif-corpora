Motivation

T

HE most frequently diagnosed cancer for Canadian women is by far breast cancer. This is applicable to the most of the developed countries. An average Canadian

\"oman has a 1 in 9 chance to develop breast cancer in her life time. Each day more than 10 women die in Canada from breast cancer. Because the Canada population is aging, the number of women who will die from breast cancer will increase [1]. There is no cure for breast cancer. The only effective way to save the patient life is early detection and removing cancerous cells. X-ray mammography is a very important tool and the most commonly used method for early detection. For women aged over 40 years old, screening mammography is recommended once a year. This result in huge number of mammograms that they need to be examined and interpreted by trained radiologists. Unfortunately, mammograms are one of the most difficult medical images to interpret. Specifically, visual assessment of microcalcification turns out to be a challenging task. Approximately 25% of the cancers that are visible on retrospective review are failed to detect by radiologists [2].

2 Thus, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are motivated to help the radiologists with this tedious task. In fact, the goal of a CAD systems is not to create a high-tech radiologist or automate the detection procedure. CAD systems are intended to act as the first cut in the process and a second opinion for the radiologists. The term" second Opinion" means that the radiologists can use the results of a computer analysis of the mammogram in making a diagnosis. A CAD system tries to locate suspicious regions in the mammogram for more detailed examination by the radiologists.

1.2

A CAD system based on texture features

Ovcr last two decades several approaches have becn used by image processing scientists and researchers to develop a CAD system for microcalcification detection. A series of different methods and research results are briefly addressed in chapter five. Texture features are

important and commonly used. It is not only used in breast cancer detection, but also is extensively used in other applications which deal with abnormality detection in medical images. Any texture classification method involves two major steps:

· Feature Extraction · Classification
In this thesis both concepts are studied and a new method is proposed. Researchers have found the feature extraction more challenging and numerous different methods have been proposed and applied. Recently, Kim et. al. [3] showed the effectiveness of the Support

Vector I\1achine (SVM) in texture classification and its advancement over neural networks. Since SVM performs well in high dimensional space such as the space spanned by texture images, they successfully employed SVM without any external features. In fact, the kernel function in SVM algorithm, implicitly performs feature extraction. Since SVM is basically

suited for two-class classification problems, it is potentially a good choice for several different medical imaging which deal with abnormality detection. The main contribution of this thesis in the sense of texture classification is proposing a new texture classification algorithm by effectively employing ext.ernal features wit.hin SVI\l kernel and introducing a new feature extraction method for texture classification.

Chapter 2 SVM Learning Classifier

S

UPPORT vector machine is basically proposed for the case of binary classification. The main idea of support vector machine is to construct a hyperplane as the decision

surface in such a way that the margin of separation between positive imd negative examples is maximized. This goal is motivated by principle:,; of statifitical learning theory and the method of structural risk minimization [4], [5]. Indeed, the support vector machine ifi an approximate implementation of the structural risk minimization. According to the statistical learning theory, the error rate of a learning machine on the test data (i.e. the generalization error rate) is bounded by the sum of the training-error rate and a term that depends on Vapnick-Chervonenkis(VC) dimension [4]. In the case of separable patterns, SV11 produces a value of zero for the first term and minimize the second term. Accordingly, The optimal hyperplane which is sought by SVM is equivalent to minimum bound on the VC-dimension. In the following, we first review the formulation of SVM in the simple case of separable patterns and then we discuss the case of non-separable case.

2.1

Linear SVM Classifier

Let vector x E X denote a pattern to be classified, and let scalar y denotes its class label Y E {± 1}. In addition, let {(Xi, Yi), i

=

1, 2, ... , I} denote a given fiet of I training exam pIes.

6 The problem is how to construct a classifier [i.e., a decision function I(.?:)] that can correctly classify an input. pattern that. is not necessarily from the training set.. On the assumption of linearly separable case, there exist a linear function of the form

Such that for each training example

f (Xi) < 0 for

J-Ii = -l. In ot.her words, training examples from the t.wo different classed are

s<'parated by the hyperplane f(x)

= w T X + b = O.

For a given training set, while there may exist many hyperplane that separate the two classes, the SV1\1 classifier is based on the hyperplane that maximizes the separating margin bet\vpen the two classes. In other words, SVI\i finds the hyperplane that causes the largest separation between the decision function values for the borderline members of the two classes referred as support vectors. This hyperplane can mathematically be found by minimizing the following cost function:

1 1 W(w) = -wTw = -II

a hyperplane. In this case, slack variables, denot.ed by

f;i, can be introduced to relax the sC'parability constraints in (2.4) as follows:

(2.5)
Accordingly, the cost function in (2.2) can be modified as follows:

(2.6) where C is a user-specified, positive, regularizat.ion parameter. In (2.6), the variable ~ is a vector containing all the slack variables
~i,

i = 1,2, ... , I.

The modified cost function in (2.6) constitutes the so-called structural risk, which balances empirical risk (i.e., the training error reflected by second term) with model

complexity (t.he first term) [6]. The regularization parameter C controls this trade-off.
The purpose of llsing model complexity to constrain the optimization of empirical risk is t.o avoid overfilling, a situation in which the decision boundary too precisely corresponds to the training data, and thereby fails to perform well on data outside the training set..

Non-Linear SVM Classifier

In practice, input patterns are unlikely to be linearly separable. Non-linear SVr'vl is

tivated by Cover's theorem [7] on the separability of patterns. The theorem states that snch a linearly non-separable pattern space can be transformed into a new feature space where patterns are liuf'arly separable with a high probability. According to the theorem, the transform must be non-linear and the dimellsion of feature space lllust be high enough. Let x denote a vector drawn from the input space X, assumed to be of dimension mo. Let
{cI>j(X)}j~]

denote a set of non-linear transformatiolls from the input space to the feature

It is assumed that {cI>j(x)} is defined a prior for all j. Then, a

hyperplane acting as decision surface is defined as:

where {1Oj} j~l denotes a set of linear weights com1E'cting the feature space to output space, and b is the bias. The equation (2.7) can be simplified by writing:

L wjcI>j(x) = 0
j=O

(2.8)

wllf're it is assumed that cJ>o(x) = 1 for all x, so that Wo denotes the bias b. Equation (2.8 ) df'fines the decision surface computed in the feature space in terms of the linear weights of the machine. The quantity cI>j(x) represent the input supplied to the weight
Wj

via the

feature space. In fact, the vector [<l>o(x), cI>l(X), ... , cI>m1 (X)]T can be considered the "image" induced in the feature space due to the iuput vector x. The problem of finding weight coefficients w can be formulated as an optimization problem with constraint. It can be shown that finding optimal hyperplane is equal to minimizing the cost function [G]:

The parameter C is regarded as the regularization parameter and is selected by user. A large C corresponds to assigning a higher penalty to the training errors. Given the training samples as {(Xi, di)}~l' the constraiuts which must be satisfied are:

EATURE selection is a crucial step in sigual and image classification and pattern recognition. The goal of feature selection is having large" between class distance" and

small "within-class variance" in the feature vector space. SVJ\'I classification method basically does not incorporate any external feature. In fact the kernel function implicitly extract features within the learning scheme. The main focus of current and following chapter is investigating the effectiveness of employing external features \\'ithin SV:M kernel. In the following sections three feature

extraction methods are reviewed and they will be compared in the next chapter.

Local discriminant basis

supervised selection of basis functions from redundant and structured basis that are well localized both in time and frequency. The tree structured dictionary of the basis, which is provided by wavelet packet transform, is pruned to find the most discriminative basis for the

In the following subsections, wavelet, wavelet packet, and LDB algorithm are briefly
reviewed.

3.1.1

Wavelet and Wavelet Packet Transforms

Fourier transform has been the principle tool for signal analysis for a long time. It constructs a siuusoidal basis to describe the energy distribution of a signal in frequency domain. But Fourier transform has a drawback that the time (or spatial) information is lost due to the integration over entire real axis. Thus by looking at the Fourier Transform domain it. is impossible to say when (or where) a particular phenomena took place. However most of the practical signal and images contain quasi-periodic and quasi-stationary characteristics that capturing them is crucial for classification purpose. \Vindowing the signal and applying Fourier Transform to each window (Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) ) was the first attempt to overcome this problem. STFT in turn, reduces the frequency resolution which is in compliance with Heisenberg uncertainty principal [10J. Wavelet transform, which is based on multiresolutional analysis, were proposed and developed to overcome fixed resolution problem in STFT. Similar to the Fourier transform, that describes a signal iu terms of the sinusoidal waves of various frequencies. wavelet analysis is an attempt to describe a signal according to shifted and scaled versions of a basis function. This basis function is referred as mother wavelet. By considering the wavelets and sine waves, depicted in Fig 3.1, we can see intuitively that signals with sharp changes might be better analyzed with an irregular wavelet than with a smooth sinusoid. It also makes sellse that local features can be described better with wavelets that have local extent. The discrete wavelet transform is defined as [10]:

denote the collection of training signals in class l, in

which the superscript (I) indicates the class that the signal belongs to. Suppose that each s belongs to a unique class so that N = N]

LDB uses this training set of

signals to search for a best basis in available libraries of bases respect to its cost function.

Linear predictive coding

Lincar predictive coding (LPC) is a popular and effective technique for signal compression [12], [13]. In particular, it has been employed successfully for speech coding [14], [15], [16],

[17] and image compression [18].
Usually, in a linear predictive coder, a sample of the image signal to be coded is first pn'dictC'd. If tIl(' sample is predicted as
a

weighted

Sl1m

of other samples of this signal, the

LPC is called the autoregressive (AR). If the sample is predicted from a known excitation, the LPC is referred to as the moving average (IvIA) model. if the sample is predicted using both the signal to be coded and an excitation signal, the LPC is known as the autoregressive moving average
(AR~lA)

model. In this thesis, the (AR) model has been used and it is

reviewed in the following subsections.

The equation 3.7 can be converted to an equality by including an hypothetical input term,
Ou(n), which is referred as excitation in speech analysis literature. The ('quation can be

written as:
]J

8('11) = LOis(n - i)

(3.8)

where 11(11) is a normalized hypothetical input and G is its gain. By expressing Eq. 3.8 in the z-domain we get the relation:

(3.9)

leading to the transfer function:

1 A(z)

(3.10)

Fig. 3.8 is presenting the transfer function in 3.10. The linear prediction model indicates that a signal 8(n) can be estimated by a system of order p with a scaled input u(n). While the signal is quasi-stationary the input. can be a random noise or arbitrary quasi-periodic signal. Accordingly, the A(z) coefficients can provide an efficient feature for preseuting the signal s(n).

3.2.3

The Autocorrelation method

In this approach, it is assumed that the signal segment, 87/ (171), is idcntically zero outside
the interval 0 ::; m ::; N - 1. This is equivalent to assuming that the signal, s(m

+ 'II),

is multiplied by a finite length window, w( 111), which is identically zero outside the range

o ::; m ::; N

- 1. Thus the signal sample for minimization can be expressed as:

S7/(m) = 8(m. + n).w(n),
."in

0::; m :s; 1V - 1 otherwise

According to this equation, for

again no prediction ('rIor because m = 0 (Le., fromm = () to m

(m) =

> N - 1. However, in the region of

=]J -

1) the windowed signal sll(rn) is being predicted from

previous samples, some of which are arbitrarily zero. Hence the potential for relatively large prediction errors exists in this region. Furthermore, in the region of m = N - 1 (i.e., from m = N - 1 to m = N - 1 + p) the potential of large prediction errors again exists because the zero-valued (weighted) signal is being predicted from at least some nonzero previous samples. The purpose of the window of Eq. 3.21 is to taper the signal near m = () and near m = N - 1 so as to minimize the errors at section boundaries. Based on using the weighted signal of Eq. 3.21 the mean-squared error becomes:

A N Dvel SVM Kernel for Texture Classification

4.1

Motivation for texture classification

Researchers have been working for several years to implement image understanding algoritlnlls that can duplicate the excellent ability of human brain to recognize objects. In addition to shape of an object, it is believed that texture characteristics play an important role in human brain and visual system to recognize and interpret objects in perceived images. Consequently, texture analysis has been an active research field and large number of diverse algorithms have been proposed and tried. Texture classification currently is used as an essential part in a variety of image processing applications.

4.2

Applications

A wide range of different industrial applications have been successfully implemented based on texture analysis algorithms.

to ddeet infected tissues by ulcer and coli in endoscopic images. Texture features and analysis is also used for breast cancer detection. Gurcan ct. aI. [27] used higher order statistical texture features for detection of microcalcifications in mammograms. Tlwy used skewness and kurtosis to discriminate between normal and abnormal tissues. In allot her work, textural features was used by Kim and Park [28] to detect microcalcific:ation in digitized l\Iammography. A computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for automatic abnormalities detection in chest radiographs was introduced by Ginneken et. aI. [29] using local texture analysis.

4.3

Texture Classification Challenges and Previous works

Texture classificatioll algorithms generally include two crucial steps: 1) feature extraction and 2) classification. In the following subsections the aforementioned and the previous work on each of them are addressed.

4.3.1

Feature Extraction

In feature extraction stage, a set of features are sought that can be efficiently computed and
embody as much discriminative information as possible about the textural characteristics.

Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

32 There are several methods for extracting textural feature which can be loosely classified as statistical, model-based and signal processing methods [3]. In statistical methods, textures are modelled using statistical measures. These methods are motivated by the fact that psychophysical experiments have demonstrated human visual system ability to extract some statistics of an order higher than two [30].The major drawback to this type of method is the enormous amount of data involved in higher order statistics. In l\lodel-based methods, textures are characterized based on probability distribution in random fields, such as l\Iarkov chains and l\larkov random fields (MRFs) [31], [32]. MRF based methods are ,,,·idely used but they are computationally expensive. Signal processing methods (also referred as multichannel filtering) are popular due to their simplicity of implementation. In these methods a textured input image is decolllposed into feature images using filter banks such as Gabor, wavelet or neural network based filters [33], [34], [35]. The main issue in these methods is selection of optimum set of filters for the problem in hanel.

4.3.2

Classification

In the second stage of a texture classification algorithm, a classification paradigm is constructed to distinguish between texture features corespondent to different texture classes. Several different classifiers have been reported. Minimum distance classifier based
011

Eu-

clidean or Mahalanohis distance was used in [36] and [37]. Manian et. al. used K-nearcst lleighbor in [38J. Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) was used in [39J by Clausi and Jernigan. Raghu and Yegnanarayana used artificial neural network (ANN) in [40J. Bayesian classifier was used in [41], [42J. Bayesian classifier is known as optimal classifier, but calculation of underlying probability distribution of the problem under study is not practically possible, specially in the absence of adequate number of training samples. In this thesis, the SVM has been chosen since it was shown that SVM outperforms other classification methods [6].

33 Superiority of SVl\I originates from its ability to generalize in high dimensional spaces, sHch as the space which is spanned by texture patterns. The generalization ability of SVM is based on its profound relation to the underlying statistical learning theory. In fact, SVM is an approximate implementation of Structural Risk l\1inimization method(SRM) since it imposes a theoretical bound on generalization error and sparseness of the solution. In SVM, instead of minimizing an objective function based on the training salllples ( sueh as mean square error), it is attempted to minimize a bound on generalization error ( i.e., the error made by the learning machine on test data not used during training). Therefore. an SVl\I tend to perform well when applied to data outside the training set. SVM achieves this advantage by focusing on the training examples that are most difficult to classify. These "borderline': training examples are called support vectors. Since SVM is a learning based classifier, it is mostly comparable with Neural Network. A brief comparison is given in Table 4.1. Table 4.1: Brief comparison between SVM and NN

External features to build a new kernel for SVM

SVl\l in texture classification problem. In fact, in an SVl\1, feature extraction is implicitly

performed by a kernel, which is defined as the dot product of two mapped patterns. There are some basic and popular kernels which are widely used ill different research including Kim et. al. 's work [3]. It is believed that the proper selection of SVM kernel significantly affect
t he overall performance of the algorithm.

In this thesis, we are seeking a tranSfOl"lllatioll within SVl\I kernel to transform input patterns to a llew space with emphasizing on difff'rf'llces hetween classes and deemphasizing on similarities. In practice, this is important when \\'e face small learning set and there i:-5 a need of model-free representation space. A variety of approaches has been llsed such as \vavelet packet based algorithms [43] (selection of the best discriminative basis) and methods based on time-frequency representations (TFR) [44], [45](selection of the best TFR within Coben's class [19]). Also, LPC has been widely used in speech recognition and coding

applications [46]. In this section, the effectiveness of the aforementioned features are studied and compared. The most effective feature is employed ill developing a new kernel for SVl\I. The main contribution of this thesis, in the sense of texture classification, is incorporating an optimized external feature into a new kernel function for the SVM algorithm. proposed kernel has the form of:

Classification and segmentation Results

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were performed on classification and segmentation of several test images. The test images were drawn from two different commonly used texture sources: the Brodatz album [48] and MIT vision texture (VisTex) database [49]. Table 4.2 summarize the source of the test images. All textures are gray-scale images with 256 levels. The classifiers were trained on randomly selected portions of subimages of texture images that are not included in the test subimages.

Comparison with Original SVM method

Images in Fig.4.2 are 256 x 256. Classifiers were trained by 1000 patterns from each texture. This corresponds to about 1.7 percent of the total available input patterns. The results are compared at different window sizes of 9 x 9,13 x 13,17 x 17,and 21 x 21. The original SVl\1 shows the optimal classification rate at window size 17 x 17. In the proposed LPC-SVl\1 the classification error rate decreases by increasing window size. Classification error rates are presented in Table 4.10 and 4.4. The proposed method outperforms the original SV:l\I specifically in larger window size. This is due to the ability of LPC kernel in inducing more

Comparison with Other Classification methods

In order to establish the superiority of the LPC-SV:t\i, its performance is compared with the most common techniques in texture classification. The spatial gray level dependence method (SGLDM) or co-occurrence matrix method. Fourier power spectrum method, tree- structured wavelet transform method, Laws texture features and Gabor method are used. The SGLDM estimate!"' the second-order joint conditional probability density functions, writtpn in matrix form and are called co-occurrence matrices. Haralick [50] proposed fourteen statistical

features that can be computed from these matrices. Although SGLD:t\1 has been proven to perform well for texture classification, the selection of the appropriate distance between pixels and angle for the co-occurrence matrix computation poses a problem and it is also computationally intensive. The Fourier spectrum method has not performed well even in earlier comparisons [51]. The statistical Fourier features of average magnitude, maximum magnitude, energy and features using the zonal masks used in [51] are computed. In the tree-structured wavelet transform (T\VT) method, the texture samples are decomposed into multiresolution hierarchy only at nodes where the energy of the decomposed subimages is not significantly smaller than the other subimages at that leveL The energy map of the channels is used as a feature vector for classification [52]. Energy features up to four level of decompositions are considered. This method has the drawback of becoming noisy at higher levels of decomposition. Four of the most powerful Laws mask are used to compute the texture energy measures [53]. Gaussian window function is used to compute Gabor transform and the Gabor coefficients are approximated using an optimization criteria [54]. Average energy and residual features are computed with this method. The feature selection process is applied with all methods in order to obtain the best feature set for each algorithm

The proposed method is compared with two new method, Logical Operators [38] and wavelet co-occurrence features method [37]. Results are listed in Tables 4.8 and 4.9.

Gabor Filter Banks
filtering is an effective in texture classification and is widely used. Filter

~Iuliti-channel

banks have the ability of decompose an image into relevant texture features suitable for the purpose of classification. Multi-channel filtering is motivated by its ability to mimic Human Visual System (HVS). Hubel and \iViesel [55] showed that simple cells in retina are sensitive to specific orientations with approximate bandwidth of 30°. In addition to sensitiYity, tIl(' HVS has spatial frequency sensitivity [56]. This consequently led to a HVS lllodpl consist of independent detector mechanism each preceded by a relatively narrow band Filter tuned to a different frequency. Experiments indicate that the frequency bandwidth of simple cells ill the visual cortex is about one octave [57]. In this way, Gabor filters are motivated to be used in the filter bank clue to thpir ability to be tuned into various oriental and spatial, spatial frequency characteristic. Spatially, a Gabor function is a Guassian modulated by a sine or cosine:

And in the frequency domain:

We introduce Gabor Filter bank in this section to note that the ability of LPC-SVM algorithm in dealing with highly non-stationary and non-periodic signals, can be improved by adding gab or filter bank features. It is believed that gabor filter banks have an excellent ability in extracting non-stationary features. The main challenge in deploying Gabor filter

bank is proper and efficient feature selection. In the proposed method, LPC is used and the end of each filter for feature extraction. Such a feature extraction is not efficient for most of the classifiers and learning algorithms. Considering the ability of SVrvl in high dimensional feature spaces, the resulting algorithm i::i an excellent pattern recognition algorithm.

mortality increases if the cancerous tumors are not detected early. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment has a critical role in increasing the chance of survival. X-ray mammography is the most effective, low cost and highly sensitive method capable of detection of breast cancer in asymptomatic woman at its early stage [58]. There are two types of mammography: screening and diagnostic. The objective of screening mammography is to detect cancer when it is still small in asymptomatic woman. The diagnostic mammography is an X-ray examination of the breast of a woman who has either breast cancer symptoms or an abnormality in her screening mammography. An increasing number of developed countries have started screening mammography. "Vomen over 40 years of age are recommended to obtain mammograms regularly for screening purpose. This results to a huge number of mammogram that needs to be examined and interpreted by expert radiologists.

Motivation for a CAD system
clus~

Among the various types of hreast abnormalities that are visible in the mammograms,

tered micro calcification and mass lesions are the most important ones. Masses and clustered microcalcifications often characterize early breast cancer that can be detected in mammograms before a woman or physician can palp them. Among these two early signs, the cluster microc:alcific:ation is more difficult to be detected. A microc:alcification is a small granule-like calcium deposit that has accumulated in the breast tissue, alld it appears as a small bright spot embedded within an inhomogeneow:; background of the mammogram. Clustered micro calcification is defined by radiologist as the presence of three or more visible rnic:rocalcific:ations within a square of 1 cm 2 . It is very difficult to interpret X-ray mammograms because of the aforementioned tiny size of microcalcification and the very small differences in the image densities of various breast tissues, specially in dense breast. It is estimated that radiologists fail to detect approximately

25% of the cancers that are visible on retrospective review [2]. This significant failure rate is due to visual fatigue, inexperienced radiologist and noise and lack of contrast in mammograms. Screening mammography also results in a huge number of mammograms which must be examined by experienced radiologist. Manual reading, the current exalllination procedure, is labor intensive, time consuming and demands great concentration. To help radiologist to overcome this huge hurden more accurately and in a reasonable time, several CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) systems have been proposed and tried. Indeed, the goal of CAD systems is not to create a high-tech radiologist or automate the

The term" second Opinion" means that the radiologists can use the results of a computer analysis of the mammogram in making a diagnosis.\iVe try to locate suspicious regions in the mammogram for more detailed examination by the radiologists.

5.2

Previous work

Several CAD systems have been designed for extracting abnormalities in breast X-ray images. A few number of the most popular and recently proposed methods are briefly reviewed in the following. The reviewed methods and algorithm are summarized and listed in Table 5.2.

5.2.1

Shape Analysis
[59] developed a set of shape factors to measure the roughness of contours of

Shen ct. al.

calcifications in mammograms and for use in their classification as malignant or benign. The analysis of mammograms is performed in three stages. First, a region growing technique is used to obtain the contours of calcifications. Then, three measures of shape features, including compactness, moments, and Fourier descriptors are computed for each region. Finally, their applicability for classification is studied by using the three shape measures to form feature vectors. Classification of 143 calcifications from 18 biopsy-proven cases as benign or malignant using the three measures with the nearest-neighbor method was reported 100% accurate.

5.2.2

Iterative feature extraction

Karssemeijer [60] implemented an adaptive noise equalization and statistics-based model for the detect of microcalcification. As a pre-processing step, a robust rescaling was applied

49

as a filter adaptive noise equalization, which estimated noise characteristic from the image at hand. This system also took into account the impact of the variability in the tissue across t.he image. I\IicrocaIcifications were detected in these rescaled images using an initial segmentation and an iterative process used to update the pixel labels. The labelling process used filtered versions of the mammogram, each of which depicted a local image feature thought to be important in distinguishing a microcalcification. This work used 25 training images and another 40 for testing, from the Nijmegen database. These images all contained one or more known clusters of microcalcifications labelled by an expert radiologist. The images were digitized at 12 bits of gray-scale and to a size of 2048 x 2048 pixels.

5.2.3

Thresholding and morphology
[61] proposed an algorithm including three basic steps. First, the digital

Nishikawa et. al.

mammogram is enhanced using a spatial filter. This step tries to enhance the signals from micro calcification and suppress the signals from background structures of the breast. Second, global and local gray-level thresholding and a morphological crosin is used to extract potential microcalcifications from the image. Third, the feature analysis are used to reduce the number of false positive(FP) detections. The algorithm has been tested on a database (10bits/pixel, 0.1 mm/pixel) of 78 mammograms with size of 800 x 1000 pixels. Half of the images

without microcalcification and half of them with at least one microcalcification for a total of 41 microcalcifications. Visual interpretation was used for determining the true positive rate and the average number of false positives per image. A true positive rate of %85 were obtained at an average false positive detection of one per image.

5.2.4

Multiscale matched filters

Strickland and Hahn [62J developed a wavelet transform algorithm which acted as a bank of multiscale matched filters for the clustered microcalcification. By studying the cross

50
section of clustered microcalcifications, Strickland and Hahn concluded that it is reasonable to model a microcalcificatioll using a circularly-symmetric Gaussian function. Thus, the matched filters were designed for detecting Gaussian objects in correlated IVlarkov noise. The I\IaTkov noise were adopted as the model of background and normal tissues. The method was tested on a database of 40 mammograms digitized at 12 bits/pixel and 100 11m/pixel. The data based consisted of 40 mammograms with size 2048 x 2048 pixels. Each mammograms contained at Olle or more clusters microcalcifications. A duster was considered detected if two or more microcaleifications w('re found within the truth circle. An False Positive (FP) was counted if two or more erroneous detections were made within an empty, dosed region of 0.5 in width. The results showed that the method could achieve a True Positive(TP) rate of about 55% with 0.7 FP detection per image. Alternatively, a TP rate of about 85% with a corresponding 3.2 FP per image.

5.2.5

Statical feature of surrounding region

Kim and Park [28] proposed a method based on statistical textural features. In their method, four features named horizontal-weighted sum, vertical-weighted sum, diagonal-weighted sum and grid-weighted sum are computed based on the surrounding region matrix. Surrounding region matrix presents softness or coarseness for each Region Of Interest (ROI). The extracted features are feed into a three-layer back-propagation neural network for classificatioll. 120 X-ray mammograms were selected from the patient files based on visual crit.eria and biopsy results. The mammograms were digitized with pixel size of 100 Jim and 12 bits per pixel. 172 ROI's were selected to evaluate the method. 72 ROI's contained microcalcification and 100 ROI's without microcalcification. 86 ROIs ".'ere used for training including 36 ROI's with micro calcifications. A fraction of 0.8 TP were reported at 0.4 FP.

5.2.6

Laplacian scale-space

Netsch and Peitgen [63] developed a method based on the Laplacian scale-space representation of the mamlllogram. Their motivation for applying Laplacian filtering originates on the fact that microcalcifications have an small bright circular appearance or slightly elongated spots in the mammogram. Bright spots corresponds to local maxima in Laplacian filtered images if the size of the filter kernel is chosen appropriat<'ly. Netsch and Peitgen applied their method on database of 40 mammograms digitized at 12 bits/pixel and 100 11m/pixel. The database consisted of 40 mammograms with size 2048 x 2048 pixels. Each mammograms contained one or more clusters microcalcifications. They achieved 85% TP detection at 1 FP per image.

5.2.7

Spatial statistical features and wavelet features

Yu and Guan [64] used a mixture of wavelet features and gray level statistical features. A set of 15 features were selected among 31 features by measuring the discriminatory power of the features using general regression neural networks via sequential forward and sequential backward selection method. The method were applied to a database of 40 digitized mammograms of 21 patients. The database included 105 microcalcific:ation and were digitized with 12 bit per pixels. The true positive of 90% were reported at 0.5 false positive per image. It mllst be noted that test data were used in feature extraction step. This must be considered, when the results of this work is compared with other above mentioned methods.

Using the gray level pixels without prior pre-process stage causes problem in training of SVM due to the very large number of training sample presenting normal tissue in comparison with the few nUlllber of twilling samples presentillg miCTocalcifications. El-Naqa ct ol. [65] proposed an algorithlll referred as succes::;ive cnhallCelllCl1t-learning(SEL) to reduce the training samples without microcalcification. The algorithm were evaluated using a database provided by the Department of Radiology at The University of Chicago. The data set contained 76 clinical mammograms, all containing multiple microcalcifications. Thc mammograms were of dimension 1000 x 700 pixels, with a spatial resolution of O.lmrn/pixel and 10 bits gray scale. The database included 1120 microcalcifications detected by expert radiologists at the Department of Radiology of Ulliversity of Chicago. A correct rate of 94% were reported at one false positive per image. The authors compared their algorithm with several other methods and claimed its superiority.

Multi-resolution Based Segmentation
[66] proposed a multi-resolution approach combined wavelet analysis to

provide a segmentation of potential calcifications. An Initial multi-resolution approach to fuzzy c-means(FCl\I) scgmentation was employed. Some tissue areas were chosen in each image and were broken into multiple windows. \Vithin each window, wavelet analysis was used to generate a contrast image, and a local FCM segmcntation generated an estimate of local intensity. A sirnple two-rule fuzzy system thereafter combined intensity and contrast information to derive fuzzy memberships of pixels in the high-contrast, bright pixel class.

potential of enhancing noise as well. To reduce the number of samples prior to classification, a highly sensitive algorithms can be used to detect suspicious sites in the mammogram. Our proposed methods includes three steps: ( as shown iu Fig. 5.2) a) Segmentation of image to tissue and non-tissue regions. b) Image enhancement c) Detection of suspicious sites d) Applyiug the improved SV"t\1 to sample of windows centerC'd at the suspicious sites.

In the following subsections the aforementioned steps are discllssed in more details.

5.3.1

Image segmentation

The proposed algorithm begins by separating the mammographic tissue from non-tissue regions in the image. The fuzzy c-mean (FCl\1) [67] is used in this thesis, which is basically an unsupervised least-squares clustering algorithm. The FCl\1 is similar to hard c-mean (HCM) approach but employs fuzzy membership when labelling data points rather than assigning crisp labels as in HCM. In FCl\1, a set of initial cluster centres are specified and an iterative process begins to adjust initial centres and calculate the fuzzy membership of all data points to the corresponding centres. At the end, maximal membership is employed for determination of crisp labelling from the fuzzy membership. FCM is initiated by assiguillg an initial class label to each data point determined from
the initialization routine. This assignment is stored in l1lcl1lbcrship l1latrix ( equation 5.1).

In this equation, k is an index into the image for data point

This process continnes until the measnre of the distance between old cluster centres and each set of Hew cluster centres meets a threshold criterion. At termination, the cluster centres for newly discovered data clusters as well as labels for the data points can be retrieved. however, this algorithm is computationally expensive due to its memory requirements, iterative nature, and slow convergence for large data sets sHch as high resolution lllamruograms. In this thesis, to reduce the data points processed by the algorithm, a multi-resolution approach is employed. The image is first down sampled by a factor of 16 and the algorithm is applied to the down sampled image. This decrease the convergence time of the procedure significantly, while the accuracy of the segmentation is still acceptable for the purpose of segmenting image to tissue and non-tissue. Local and global thresholding is finally applied to the image.

Enhancement of the mammograms

The fundamental enhancement needed in mammography is an increase in contrast, espedally for dense breast. Contrast between malignant tissues and normal dense tissue may be present on a mammogram but below the threshold of human perception. Similarly, micro-

Conventional image processing t.echniques do not perform well on mammographic images [68]. In this thesis, selective median filtering is used to remove background noise while preserving the edge information of suspicious areas. This approach was proposed by Lai ct
al. [69]. A selective median filter is defined as follows:

Given a window IF (i, j), centered at image coordinates (i, j), t.he output of the selective median filter is:

:ri,j = median{xl',s E

where

.Ti,j

is the image intensity at (i,j), N(i,j) is the area in the image covered by window

W (i, j) ,and T is the threshold. In computing the median, the set of pixels are restricted to
those with a differC'llee in gray level no greater than the threshold T, The amount of edge smearing can be controlled by adjusting the parameter T. If T is small, the edge preserving power of the filter is strong, but its smoothing effect is smalL If T is large, the filter behaves the other way around. In the llext step of enhancC'ment the image's contrast is improved by contrast-to-noise ratio method [70]:

Preprocessing

The preprocessing detection of suspicious area is based on the hypothesis that the microcalcification present in mammograms can be preserved under a transform which can localize the signal characteristics in the original and transform domain. In a time signal the harmonic frequency components are present but they are hidden, \vhereas in its frequency spectrum the time information is hidden. Therefore, transforms with basis functions other than the complex sinllsoids must be used. In addition, these basis functions must be able to localize the signal in both spatial and frequency domains. A suitable transform that satisfies t.he above requirements is the wavelet transform. The wavelet transform uses basis functions that can dilate in scale and translate in position according to the signal characteristics. Given that the microcalcifications correspond to high frequency components of the image spectrum and wavelets can localize signal characteristics in both frequency and scale, our hypothesis is that the resolution and scale of the rnicrocalcificatiolls in the spatial domaill can be preserved if we use wavelet filters to decompose the mammogram into different frequency subbands. Accordingly, microcalcifications can be extracted from mamlllograms by suppressing the subband of the wavelet-decomposed image that carries the lowest frequencies and contains smooth (background) information, before the reconstruction of the image. The proposed system is described in the block diagram shown in Fig. 5.3. The origillal mammogram is decomposed into a set of orthogonal subbands of different resolution and frequency content. The decomposition is based on wavelet analysis filtering and downsampling along the rows and colullllls of the illlage. Fig. 5.4 shows the seven subbands of resuItillg after two levels of wavelet decomposition of the image. The four subbauds at resolution 1 are produced by the decomposition scheme described in Section 3.1.1. The application of the same decomposition scheme to the upper-left subband that carries the lowest frequencies at resolution 1 results in the two level subband decomposition shown in Fig. 5.4. In the wavelet decomposed image shown in Fig. 5.4 the upper-left

subband at resolution level 2 contains the background intensity of the original image and, thus, carries the lowest frequencies of the image spectrum. The microcalcifications, which corresponds to the highest frequencies, are carried by other subbands. The detection of microcalcifications is accomplished by setting the wavelet coefficients of the upper-left subband to zero in order to suppress the image background information before the reconstruction of the image. The reconstructed mammogram is expected to contain only high-frequency components, including the microcalcifications. The reconstruction consists of wavelet synthesis filtering and up-sampling along the rows and columns of the image. The wavelet filters used in analysis and synthesis stages, are maximally flat wavelet filter constructed by Daubechies [71]. These wavelets are compactly supported and regular.

the preprocess depends on the length of the wavelet filters used in the decomposition of the mammograms. This is a direct sequence of the different f-ihapes of the corresponding mother wavelets. According to Fig. 5.5 and 5.6, the mother wavelet of the DAUB4 filter is more spike-like compared with that of f-il1l00ther DAUB20 filter. It is clear from these images that the DAUB4 filter detects more pixels of high spatial frequency compared with the DAUB20 filter. These pixels may belong to microcalcifications, breast boundary, or background noise. Thus, short('r wavelet filters are more sensitive to existing micro calcifications but they tend to produce more false positives. Therefor, the DAUB4 is used in this thesis to have all pot('lltialmicrocalcifications in the next step( supervised learning).

Reduction of False positives through supervised learning

The pre-processed images contain false positives which arc presenting noise and other highfrequency components rather than microcalcific<'ltion. In this step, SV11 in conjunction with

LPC is used to implement a supervised learning machine to reduce the number of false
positives. The detailed procedure is discussed in the following.

5.3.4.1 Input features
For every pixel in the pre-processed image. we define the input pattern to LPC-SVI\l to be all AI x .AJ window centered at the pixel detected in preprocess. These windows are selected from ellhallced mammogram. The 111 x 111 matrix is converted to a vector X of length 111'2 and then its length is reduced to N < .AJ'2 by using LPC feature extraction method. During the trainillg phase, each illput feature X is labelled with (y pres(,llt, or (y = -1) for mic:rocalcification absellt.

Experimental Results
Database

The research results in this thesis is based on the data sets derived from Digital Database
for Screening Mammogmphy (DDSM), located at the University of South Florida [73]. The

DDSM contains approximately 2500 cases of fully annotated mammographic images. Each case contains two views of each breast along with patient information such as age at the time of study, American College of Radiology (ACR) breast density rating, subtlety rating for abnormalities, and ACR description of each abnormality. Information about how the mammograms were digitized is also included, such as relative spatial resolution and scanner used. The DDSJ'vl is organized into" cases" and " volumes" . A" case" is a collection of images and information corresponding to one mammography exam of one patient. A case consists of between G and 10 files. These are an "ies" file, an overview" 16-bit
PGM" file, four image files that are compressed with loss less JPEG encoding and zero to

four overlay files. Normal cases will not have any overlay files.

The" .ics" file also gives an rating of 1 to 4 as assessed by an expert radiologist. The size of each image file, number of bits per pixel, the scanning resolution (in microns) and information on the existence or lack of an overlay file for each image is provided. As it can be seen in Fig. 5.7, all four images have overlays. If the image description lines had "NON-OVERLAY" instead of "OVERLAY" then the images would not have overlay files.

Structure of Overlay files
Abnormal cases have between one and four overlay files depending on the number of images in which the radiologist marked any abnormalities. Each overlay file may specify n11l1tiple abnormalities, so the first line of the file gives the total number of abnormalities. In the case of multiple abnormalities, each abnormality is then listed one after another. Each

abnormality has information on the lesion type, the assessment, the subtlety, the pathology and at least one outline. The keywords that describe the lesion type are taken from the ACR Bi-RADS lexicon. The assessment code is a value from 1 to 5, and also comes from the ACR Bi-RADS standard. The outlines for the suspicious regions are derived from markings

Selected Data Set

III this thesis 60 images are used. The Images are submitted to database from mammography clinic, the Ann L. Baraco Centre for \Vornen's Health, located at Sacred Heart Hospital in PCllsacola, Florida. The images are divided to two sets of 40 and 20 images for training and testing. The 20 images used for test are listed in Table 5.4. As described in Table 5.4, the 20 imagC's with malignant microcalcifications were divided into four sets according to density and subtlety ratings: (1) high-density breast tissue with obvious abnormalities, (2) high density breast tissue with subtle abnormalities, (3) lowdensity breast tissue with obvious abnormalities, (4) low-density breast tissue with subtle abnormalities. In Table 5.4, column 1 indicates the case category. Column 2 indicates the case number and view. The breast density rating is shown in column 3. This rating is according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data systerns (BI-RADS) density ratings. A density rating in scale 1 to 4 is used as follows [74]: 1= The brea<;t is almost entirely fat. 2

There are scattered fibroglandular densities that could obscure a lesion on a mammogram. 3 = The breast is hetrogelleously dense. This lllay lower the sensitivity of mammogram. 4= the breast is extremely dense which lowers the sensitivity of mammogram. According to this metric a higher density rating implies that it is more difficult for radiologist ( and computer) to detect the abnormality. Colull1Il 4 indicates the BI-RADS assessment rating ranging from 1 to 5. 1

The value of this measure range from 15, where 1 stands for "subtle" and 5 for "obyious". A higher subtlety rating indicates

easier interpretation task for both radiologist and computer. Columns 5 and 6 are showing pathology and lesion type as well as number of abnormalities.

Results

The training data set were used to train the proposed algorithm. 40 images including 51 micro calcification ,vere used in training phase. The preprocess algorithm on test data resulted in 5236 suspicious sites. The improved SVM then were applied to the test data. To detect the microcalcifications, the nUluber of pixels which are classified as ,. ~1icrocalcificat.ion Preseut" , are counted in each 1cm 2 of the mamlllogram. A threshold is set to dcterminc whether a site contains a microcalcification or not.
If the number of pixels which are classified

as "microcalcification present" is greater than the threshold, the site is considered as a microcalcification. The ROC curves in Fig. 5.10 were generated by varying the threshold from 3 to 14. The proposed algorithm outperforms the previously applied SV11 to the problem of microcaIcificatioll [65]. The El-Naqa ct al. algorithm were applied to current data set to obtain the ROC curve. The area under the two curves are calculated as 7.22 for LPC-SVM and 5.68 for SVM. This indicates a 26% improvement. The numerical results which were obtained here for the SVM [65] is different from original report. The reason is that the data set is different here. It is obvious that the data set can significantly affect the caIculated performance. i.e. if some difficult subtle images were excluded from the study, the performance was totally different. \Vhile the overall detection performance is very good, a morc detailed analysis of the individual cases reveals additional insight int.o the performance. The ROC for the most recent published research on the same database is given in Fig.5.11. The are under curve is 4.86 which 46% less than proposes LPC-SVM method. The detail results of the proposed algorithm are given in Table 5.5. This table is presenting the case of 1.5 false positives at 92% of correct true positive detection. As described before, the test data has been scIected for 4 classes mammograms: 1) low-density tissues with obvious calcifications, 2) low-density tiflsue with obvious calcifications, 3) high density tissues with obvious calcifications, 4) high-density tissue with subtle calcifications.

of the algorithm to these classes, are different, as ran he seen ill Tahle 5.5. The

algorithm is quite successful in detection of microcalcification in low/high density-obvious and low density subtle and more research is required for high-density subtle. The application of the proposed algorithm on the high density images are resulted in relatively high 11umher of false positives.

6.1 SVM in texture classification and external texture features

The SVl\I learning algorithm has been proven to outperform other texture dassification algorithllls \\'hich are based on snpC'rvised learning i.e. neural network.

In this thesis, the effectiveness of SVl\1 in texture classification problem was investigated.
It was shown that SVl\1 is a powerful algorithm not only for didlOtolllY ( two-dass) problems

but also for multi-texture. The effect of external features in performance of SVl\1 were studied. The estimation of the VC-dimension of the external features were used to chose the best feature set among suggested features. The comparison of the VC-dimension resulted in LPC-SVM texture classification algorithm. LPC which provides a high dimensional feature space were chosen
considering the excellent ability of SVl\1 to set a learning hyperplane in a high dimension

input features. In the study of VC-dimcnsion, LPC provides the minimum VC-dimension and training error. The discrimination ability of LPC features is reduced in high resolution classification

\Vhen we need to detect tiny feature in an image or to increase the resolution of a textme classification-based segmentation, we come across the problem of low dimension input features with poor texture information. In the low dimension input texture feature space the VC-dimension and training errors of LPC is reduced. This is due t.o t.he poor discriminant features in a slllall t.cxtUl"{' window. The Gabor filter bank is extensively and successfully used in several texture classification algorithms. To enrich the texture discrimination ability of input features in case of small window size, the Gabor filter bank were employed. III the proposed algorithm, for each sample windO\v ill the original image, corresponding sample windows from filtered version of the image are extracted and concatenated to form an input feature prior to LPC feature selection. In this way the classification accuracy was improved slightly but the time consumption of the algorithm increased considerably.

77 medical imaging applications. Detectioll of abllormalities in medical imaging is a dichotomy problem in the sense of classifying an illlage to normal and abnormal areas. The high rate of breast cancer development in WOlllen over 40 years of age, and the mortality rate was the main motivation for applying the proposed algorithm to lllicrocalcification detection in screening mammography. j\Iicrocalcificatioll is the most difficult type of breast cancer to be detected by radiologist. The major problelll in application of LPC-SV1I texture classificatioll algorithm to microcalcification detection is the asymmetry of the training data. The huge number of pixels which arc presenting normal tissue ill compare with a very few number of pixels presenting the microcalcificatiolls. A preprocess stage was added to overall algorithm to detect suspicious areas and reduce the number of the pixels presenting normal areas. The preprocess were applied prior to the proposed algorithm to increase the accuracy and time efficiency. The test data for evaluating the proposed algorithm were evenly divided into four category of mammograms. The images were divided categorized according to tissue density and the difficulty of detection of microcalcification. The results were evaluated through ROC curve and were compared with SVM algorithm. A correct rate of 92% were archived at 1.5 false positives per image. Considering the number of very difficult images in the data set used during the test, the overall performance is significant.

Research contribution

The main contribution of this work is in the field of medical imaging. The SVrvI algorithm were empowered by external features for t('xture classification. A number of external features were suggested and examined and through the study of VC-dimension the best were chosen. Tlw perfonnallce of LPC features in high resolution classification, \vere improved byemploying gabor filter bank features. The excellent ability of SV}'1 in dichotomy problems were used in detection of ahnormalities. The asymmetry problem of training data were solved with pre-process st.age based on wavelet transform decomposition and reconstruction of the mammograms. The performance of the algorithm were discussed for the images clinically categorized illto different levels of difficulty for assessment.

FUture work

More research is needed to increase the accuracy of the algorithm in subtle cases of cancer and to reduce the number of false positives in high density images. Incorporating information from other modalities such as ultra sound and }'IRI imaging must be considered to achieve a CAD system with acceptable performance for clinical usc.
