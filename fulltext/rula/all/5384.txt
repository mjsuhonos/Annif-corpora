Abstract It remains unclear if mature consumers (particularly baby boomers) in Eastern countries have similar physiological, social and psychological needs when it comes to fashion shopping and consumption. The objectives of this study are: (1) to provide in-depth information regarding the attitudes of female baby boomers in Taiwan toward aging and clothing choice; (2) to understand how female baby boomers in Taiwan behave in different contexts (work-related, social and leisure activities) of clothing usage and consumption; and (3) to identify the differences between the Taiwanese boomers and Western boomers by comparing the current findings to previous research conducted in Western societies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 female participants aged from 47 to 59 years old. Although participants were experiencing physiological, social and psychological change during the aging process, the majority of the participants expressed the willingness to stay healthy and active in their social life. It is also evident that clothing selection and consumption were closely associated with individual's profession, social status and daily activities. The sample of this study was limited to specific segment (middle to upper-class) which may not represent the diverse baby boomer populations in Taiwan. Nevertheless, this unique study should provide valuable information of aging population and clothing consumption in Taiwan to fashion practitioners, marketers and academia.

Chapter 1: Introduction 1.1 Research Background 1.1.1. Global Aging Population and Taiwan's "Mature Market" Our world is shifting from a youth-oriented to a mature society (Dychtwald 1997). According to Brannon (2010), the global demographic of the seniors population will increase tremendously by 2025. The aging population is on the rise worldwide and life expectancy continues to increase. As a result of this phenomenon, many studies have investigated the attitudes of mature consumers (baby boomers) toward a number of factors associated with aging. Clothing consumption in this demographic has been studied in many countries, including the United States (Jackson 1992; Kwon & Noh 2010; Reisenwitz & Iyer 2007), Canada (Spadaro 2012), the United Kingdom (Birtwistle & Tsim 2005), and Finland (Holmlund, Hagman & Polsa 2011). However, limited research has been undertaken on this particular topic in Asia. It is important for Taiwanese manufacturers and multinational companies to understand how Asian consumers think, feel and act in their mature-life/pre-senior stage. Due to the recent economic growth in Taiwan, knowledge of consumer perceptions, attitudes and experiences toward clothing consumption is particularly important to multinational manufacturers. According to the National Statistics Republic of China/Taiwan, the gross national wealth in that country recently increased by 7.3% in one year alone, from NT$7.5 million (CAN$ 274000) in 2010 to NT$8.1million (CAN$296000) in 2011 (National Statistics, 2011). The population aged 50 and older will reach the millions in about ten years, and the total annual disposable income of this population will be over a NT$1 trillion (CAN$36.5 billion). Therefore, the needs and aspirations of mature Taiwanese consumers cannot be ignored or underserved. In this study, I defined "mature consumers" as those who were 45 to 59 years old at the time

1

the study was conducted. We selected this demographic due to its population size and consuming power. Individuals in this group were born after the Second World War, and according to a report published by Trade Magazine (Taiwan) in 2009, they currently hold approximately 55% of the wealth in Taiwan. They are considered the most powerful group of consumers in Taiwan. As they enter the mature stage of their lives, they have more discretionary money to spend than do the younger generations (e.g., "echo boomers" or Gen Xers) because this cohort relatively has less family burden and higher disposable income (Trade Magazine 2009).

Figure 1: Population Change in Taiwan 1980-2025 (Adopted from Lin 2010).

The average age of the population of Taiwan has been increasing since 1993 (Lin 2010; see Figure 1), and its aging population has drawn substantial attention from industry, academia, and government. According to a study conducted by Lin (2010), four major factors are responsible for the rapid aging of Taiwan's population: (1) the influx of immigrants from mainland China to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949); (2) the tremendous growth of fertility rates after the Civil War, particularly during the period 1950-1962; (3) the drastic decline of birth rates after 1962; and (4) the substantial growth of life expectancy over the years. In addition to the aforementioned factors, the size of the Asian baby-boom population was also affected by the
2

decline in infant and child mortality due to the advancement of medicine and technology (Mason, Lee & Russo 2006). However, it is important to note that the baby boom that occurred in Taiwan (1950-1962) was relatively short compared to the one that occurred in the United States (1945-1964). The word "old" or "elderly" is not easy to define because there is no set agreement or consensus among scholars and demographic analysts (Moschis, Lee & Mathur 1997; Yoon, Cole & Lee 2009). Some studies have described the "mature market" as those consumers who are over age 65 (Lazer 1985) or over age 55 (Nam et al. 2007). This group has also been described as the "older market" (Allan 1981), the "muppie market" (mature, upscale, post-professional; Seelig 1986), or the "senior market" (Shoemaker 1989). Interestingly, some recent articles published in Taiwan use the term "mature market," to describe the baby-boomer cohort rather than using it to refer to those over 65 years of age. For example, Zhang (2010) uses the term "new-age elderly " (or "pre-senior market") to describe those Taiwanese consumers aged from 50 to 64. According to some studies, consumers between 50 and 65 are more active and positive towards consumption than were their parents' generation at the same age (Fleming 2004 in Kwon and Noh 2010). Wang and Heitmeyer (2006) point out that age, gender, education and other demographic factors are related to consumer behaviors including product search, selection, evaluation, purchasing decisions and consumption. 1.1.2. Changing Global Economy To be successful in this competitive global economy, it is imperative for fashion marketers and practitioners to monitor and respond to consumers' changing needs and aspirations. Clothing manufacturers need to know the cultural values and physical appearances of consumers in their target markets, and they must also monitor the rapidly changing economies of these markets.

Although globalization creates many opportunities for fashion companies to broaden their global networks, facilitate international collaborations, accelerate the process of modernization, and enhance mutual understanding among nations, it is not easy to fully understand how consumers think, behave, consume and react during globalization. The process of globalization involves many factors and raises many concerns within different societies and among many nations. For example, the 2008 financial crisis led Taiwanese consumers to become more cautious about their spending, even though many of them were reluctant to sacrifice their quality of life (Tsai 2010). In other words, many of them want to maintain the same lifestyle and consumption pattern during the time of recession. However, not much is known about the ambivalent relationship between consumer life events (e.g., economic crisis) and consumer behavior and responses. 1.1.3. The Needs of Aging Consumers Prior research studies have reported that fashion companies often focus on the younger market (e.g., generations X and Y) rather than the baby boomers or "mature market" (Peter, Shelton & Thomas 2011), partly due to the stereotypical or negative perception of older consumers (e.g., that they are non-innovative and old-fashioned). Considering the size of the baby boomer population, this generational cohort has been relatively neglected. As a result, it has been a challenge for mature aging women or baby boomers to acquire appropriate clothing styles to meet their changing physical and psychological needs. Brown (2001) points out those baby boomers have been described as the "forgotten generation." Indeed, in various studies aging or mature women have expressed their frustrations and disappointments regarding clothing purchases (Salusso, Borkowski, Reich & Goldsberry 2006). Chu & Rahman (2012), for example, reported that it was a challenge for baby boomers to find fashionable clothing with the fit, style and colour that satisfied their physiological and psychological needs. As mature consumers age,

4

their body shapes may change gradually, and in some cases drastically (e.g., wider hips, sagging waists and arms). The physical changes may lead to psychological unease, frustration and disappointment when these consumers shop for clothing. Other studies reported that some women experience fewer changes (Hsiao 2006). Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that the degree of age-related discomfort could vary among aging women. In other words, baby boomers should not be viewed or considered as a single homogeneous group. There is considerable diversity in consumers' physical health, body shapes and psychological needs within the same cohort. Regardless of the diversity among consumers, it is important to note that most aging women, including both baby boomers and seniors, do not lose their interest in grooming and clothing purchases (Francis 2011). For example, Reinecke (1976) found that apparel expenditures by women between the ages of 55 to 74 inclusive remained steady. 1.2 Research Objective Prior apparel studies on baby boomers have been primarily focused on Western demographics, particularly the North American market (Huddleston, Ford & Bickle 1993; Goldsberry, Shim & Reich 1996; Birtwistle & Tsim 2005; Wray & Hodges 2006; Lipschultz, Hilt & Reilly 2007; Howarton & Lee 2009; Kwon & Noh 2009; Holmlund, Hagman & Polsa 2010; Lewis, Medvedev & Seponski 2011; Spadaro 2012). It remains unclear if mature consumers (particularly baby boomers) in Eastern countries have similar physiological, social and psychological needs when it comes to fashion shopping and consumption. The objectives of this study are three-fold: (1) to understand how female baby boomers in Taiwan behave in different contexts (different social situations: e.g., at work vs. leisure activities) of clothing usage and consumption; (2) to provide insights and in-depth information regarding the attitudes of female baby boomers in Taiwan toward aging and clothing choice; and (3) identify the

5

differences between the Taiwanese boomers and Western boomers by comparing the current findings to a number of prior studies (Birtwistle & Tsim 2005; Reisenwitz & Iyer 2007; Kwon & Noh 2010; Holmlund, Hagman & Polsa 2011; Spadaro 2012) conducted in Western societies. The rest of this research study is organized as follows. Chapter 2 includes a literature review of relevant theories and concepts, such as shopping behavior and channels, fashion information sources, clothing attributes, and body image of baby boomers. The research methodology is explained in Chapter 3. Data analysis and empirical findings are reported in Chapter 4. This is followed by Chapter 5, the conclusion of this study, which includes a discussion of implications, limitations and suggestions for future research.

Chapter 2: Literature Review 2.1 Mature Consumers: Aging Bodies & Lifestyle During the process of aging, women face various degrees of change both physically and mentally. Most women experience a transitional phase in regard to their physical bodies during their fifties and sixties (Calasanti 2005). Irrespective of their biological or cultural makeup, for most women age-related physical changes include widening hips, sagging chest, thicker waists and loose underarms (Chu & Rahman 2012). Many aging females adopt loose or overly-casual clothing to mask or compensate for the changes that are caused by the physical realities of aging, including weight gain, altered body shapes, wrinkles and sagging or flabby arms and necks (Clarke, Griffin & Maliha 2009). Different silhouettes or garment designs offer concealment and diminishment for characteristics of the aging body which are not accepted as normal (Clarke, Griffin & Maliha 2009). Aging women are often self-conscious and constantly notice the inevitable physiological changes they experience, such as widening of the hips and upper back, the narrowing of the front shoulders, and the decrease of sitting height (Mohylsky 2011). Chattaraman and Rudd (2006) also discovered that a preference for styles that offer body coverage is highly correlated to increasing body size (2006). Mature female consumers do recognize their body changes so they seek styles that reflect and minimize those changes. They often take actions like eating healthy foods and exercising to maintain physical fitness (Mohylsky 2011). Clothing reflects a person's self-concept and lifestyle (Jong 2002). Lifestyle includes personal life, as well as psychological, social and environmental values (Chang 2010), and these issues have significant influence on consumers' purchasing behavior in clothing. Daily routines, paths of logical thoughts, and socioeconomic backgrounds reflect various lifestyles of the mature

7

segment of the population which can be categorized and analyzed to predict their shopping patterns. An exploration of pre-seniors' work-related conditions and retirement plans as to how they allocate their time, energy and spending can also help to determine their lifestyle and clothing choices. Zhang (2004) focused on older women's recreation-related lifestyles to explore their product choice and buying habits for activewear (2004); it is also suggested that persons who are involved in different exercises participate in different lifestyles than those who do not, and need to have appropriate apparel to undertake their activities (Design for aging 2011). Other research has used employment status as a subgroup to study mature consumers. Mumel and Prodnik (2005) also argued that social activities and professional activities are the common criteria to segment older consumers. Kapstein (2006) studied the sartorial decisions of professional women over sixty, and found that the clothing style symbolized their self-image and reflected not only their jobs but also their social lives. 2.2 Mature Consumers: Clothing Attributes 2.2.1. Quality (Fabric/ Comfort) It is suggested that baby boomers are pragmatic (Wang 2010: 214) and savvy about their needs; tactile quality ranks above other qualities. The principle for evaluating the quality of apparel is multidimensional (Swinker & Hines 2006). Brand label, store environment, fabric feel and construction techniques are key items for consumers when evaluating quality (Kim, Forsythe, Gu & Moon 2002). Tactile quality could include such components of a garment as fabric, comfort and workmanship. Unlike mature consumers, due to their relative lack of knowledge, expertise and cognitive skills, younger generations take emotional pleasure from visual aesthetics instead of physical comfort when they evaluate clothing (Klerk & Tselepis 2007). In the research of both Moore et al. (2008) and Mumel (2005) quality scored highly
8

positive among consumer needs in apparel purchases for female baby boomers (Spadaro 2012). Consumer needs in apparel are categorized into three groups: functional needs, social needs, and experiential needs (Kim, Forsythe, Gu & Moon 2002: 486). The criterion of style for the baby boomer is based on the premise that the clothing quality cannot be compromised, no matter the consumers are fashion advocates, simple aesthetics or concerned pragmatics. Among mature female Taiwanese, comfort and fabric are the most important of the apparel purchase criteria (Hsu 2004). 2.2.2. Fit Another important clothing attribute for mature female consumers is the fit. Tiggemann & Lacy (2009) showed that clothing has camouflage purposes by examining the relationships between purchasers' body mass index (BMI) and body dissatisfaction; they further concluded that managing their body image is an important part of women's appearance at any age (Tiggemann & Lacy 2009). Loosely-fitting clothing might be the criterion for aging women in finding suitable garments. Mohylsky (2011) addressed the problem that poorly fitting apparel leads to long-term dissatisfaction for more than half of the older women when it comes to finding a garment that fits their body proportions. It is also reported that the fit of the garments is the number one customer complaint and reason for refunds (Howarton & Lee 2009). In another research on the shopping channel (Salusso, Borkowski, Reich & Goldsberry 2006), it was reported that 69% of aging female consumers were dissatisfied with clothing fit, either due to the tightness or clinginess of the clothing on their body, or its extreme bagginess. The appropriateness of fit for pants and skirts is of particular importance to aging female consumers since during the process of aging, the enlargement of their lower body parts made them feel embarrassed and unconfident in public (Salusso, Borkowski, Reich and Goldsberry 2006). As a
9

result, 77% felt that the patterns of garments need to be altered by tailors (Salusso, Borkowski, Reich & Goldsberry 2006). 2.2.3. Style In Janelle Spadaro's (2012) research on Canadian female baby boomers' apparel preferences and satisfaction, she found that the most important attribute was fit the of the garment; second was the ease of care, followed by comfort, feel and fabric content. The quality, style and construction of the garments were fairly important and were trend-driven. Howarton and Lee (2009) also discussed apparel design preferences among female boomers, saying that fit and comfort are the most frequent answers when these consumers are asked about garment style; however, some female boomers did specify that they like the tops that are long enough to tuck in or wear outside the pants to avoid their undergarment being shown accidentally (2009). Furthermore, they discovered that female boomers do not want something that is too trendy or too dowdy. Ari Seth Cohen and Maira Kalman, the creators of Advanced Style (2012), which was inspired by Cohen's grandmother's energy and attitude, has a longtime interest in clothing and style and devotes his energies to capturing the sartorial savvy of the senior set. Finding an absence of mature faces in the fashion world, Cohen roamed the streets of New York City to photograph eye-catching older folks and interviewed them, proving that style, creativity and vitality can be presented through dressing at any age. The women Cohen documents strongly believe in individuality; some go for playful, some go for elegance, and some define ageappropriate dress as confidence (Cohen & Kalman 2012). Quality is important, they say. "It pays to invest in quality; it never goes out of style" (Cohen & Kalman 2012). These women are constantly being active to keep themselves feeling young (Cohen & Kalman 2012). From

10

Cohen's photos of those mature men and women, some common points are spotted. Accessories, such as bags, hats, scarves, handkerchiefs, sunglasses, belts, large rings, necklaces and earrings are used as highlights. Claire Lacoste Kapstein (2006) has discussed that suits are essential attire for professional business women over sixty, pointing out that older women who work in the professional sphere need a garment with both function and comfort, as well as conveying the right and symbolic message for the event (2006); however, casual attire is more flexible and may be accepted on formal occasions, as long as jogging style, tank tops, profane T-shirts, etc. are not worn (Beth Ellen Robertson 2007). Older female professionals pay close attentions to details such as, for example, sleeve lengths, skirt lengths, garment construction, textiles and fabric choices, colour intensity, print patterns, and designs around the neck like openings, collars or cleavages (Kapstein 2006). In discussing the involvement of female Taiwanese with fashion products, Oksana Bilozerova suggested that elderly women have more consideration of styling attributes than younger women, but show less interest in trend and fashion-forward products (2010). 2.2.4 Clothing Colour Colour is a decisive factor for mature women when it comes to purchasing apparel. According to the colour specialist Barbara Jacques (1989), colour is one of the most important elements in fashion design; colour and body figure can be used synergistically to express harmony aesthetic and specific meaning. The secret of looking good is the visual balance and personal confidence toward personal body shapes, types and attitudes, as well as attitudes toward clothing. Previous study had already shown that colour is one of the most important shopping attributes for clothing (Tsai 2010). In the research on how mature women buy clothing (Holmlund, Hagman & Polsa 2010), it is found that when it comes to product attributes for

11

shopping apparel, it is very common to hear comments about colour. The colour is the product variable that attracts consumers and even allows consumers to make fashion statements. Colour stimulates consumer buying (Chu & Nemeth 2010). Especially in the fashion and beauty industry, any designer, retailer or merchandiser who controls the colour, controls everything. Colours may have very personal meanings based on the different life experiences of consumers, and they can help them to make connections to feelings, memories and ideas (Brannon 2011). Colours can be used as a representing tool for image or identity, but it is important to keep in mind that colours have different meanings in different ethnicities (Chu & Nemeth 2010). The symbolic significance of this difference in colour choice among different cultures is due to the different cultural and historical background and the different aesthetic psychology of each ethnicity. Colour preference can also be different within a cultural group. It is important to note that the physiological factors such as body size, skin colour and hair colour also play a critical role when choosing the colour of apparel products because these attributes are highly related. Chu and Rahman show that western baby boomers are not afraid of colour; they want something hip, fun, trendy and fashionable (2012). On the other hand, mature Asians prefer darker values of colours, expressing solemnity, morality and loftiness, instead of dressing in gaily coloured clothes. However, another study conducted by Shoyama, Tochihara and Kim (2001), authors compared Japanese and Korean elderly, and found that bright colours and functionality played a significant role on clothing selection. With this perspective, it is reasonable to suggest that choosing the brighter image could help older women to move away from the negative and socially regressive stereotypes. In further research into ideal clothing colours for Japanese and Korean elderly women, Shoyama et al. (2003) found that Korean elderly prefer cold hues (green through violet) and achromatic colour but that the Japanese

12

elderly preferred red hue or light grayish-orange. Both Korean and Japanese responded positively to the colour white, which stands for purity and cleanliness. During the aging process, the crystalline lens gradually turns yellow, making the darker end of the spectrum much harder to identify, while the more highly saturated colours and the brighter colours like red, orange and yellow are easily recognized and preferred by the elderly (Tsai 2010). A study conducted by Guo-Bin Gao (2002) on the colour preferences among the elderly consumers in Taiwan, red and green were perceived as happy and peaceful, blue and yellow associated with youthfulness and technological savvy, extreme black and passive grey were not preferred among the mature set (Gao 2002). In other research into the colour preferences of Taiwanese mature consumers, Li-chin Tsai (2010) also found that colour was one of the most influential factors for choosing clothes, and found that red and purple were the favourite colours among the participants (Tsai 2010). In addition, Tsai's conducted a research on two age groups (Group A: 45-64; Group B: 65 and over) to investigate the colour preference of females Taiwanese through their personal viewpoints regarding cognitive age and clothing purchase. Interestingly, Group A chosen more vivid hues and lucid styles; oppositely, Group B chosen darker tone to present similarity and ambiguity. 2.3 Shopping Behavior (Value) 2.3.1. Shopping Channels The value gained during a shopping trip goes beyond functional utility and task orientation; shoppers also view experiential benefits and gratification as psychologically important (Jackson, Stoel and Brantley 2010). Diep and Sweeney (2007) concluded that both product value and store value contribute to overall shopping trip value. They found that besides the emotional, social and

13

conditional value of the products, functional value was the main driver why consumers spend their money. On the other hand, due to advanced technology and booming consumerism, consumers have a broad variety of shopping options (Cho & Workman 2011). On the type of apparel shopping locations, Jong (2002) listed some of the possible choices as department stores, discount stores, specialty stores, catalogs, TV networks and the Internet (2002). To gain competitive advantage, retailers need to enhance consumers' purchase experience, rather than just fulfilling their objectives and meeting their functional needs (Diep & Sweeney 2007). Retailers need to create a fantasy and a pleasant atmosphere for customers, providing not only a utilitarian dimension but also offering a hedonic aspect such as fun, entertainment and relaxation during the shopping trip (Seo & Lee, 2008; Diep & Sweeney, 2007). Jackson, Stoel and Brantley (2011) went further, and examined the preferred mall attributes and shopping values based on the different generational cohorts (2011). They pointed out that the baby-boomer cohort responded highly positively toward such mall attributes as entertainment, hygiene factor and location convenience (2011). Despite consumers' characteristics (Cho & Workman 2011), Cho and Workman found that touch is an important factor that affects where consumers shop. It is believed that multi-channel shopping choices are adopted by consumers that are highly innovative and technologically savvy (Goldsmith & Flynn, 2005). In the research of Peck and Childers (2003), "NTF" stands for "need for touch," and it describes the need to touch or handle the apparel before buying it. The value in the NTF is seeking the quality and the virtual interaction with the product itself, and the satisfaction of the need for touch could be objective ­ including hardness, texture and weight of the garments - or subjective, such as fun, sensory stimulation and enjoyment that arises during clothing assessment. Cho and Workmen (2011) went further, suggesting that the need for touch

14

and online apparel purchasing has a negative correlation since some consumers are not willing to spend their money without touching and interacting with the products. Kwon and Noh (2009) investigated the attitudes of American baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) toward online apparel shopping, and found out that price is decisive; in addition; past experience will affect their involvement in online purchasing. Discount stores are also a popular shopping place for apparel. Jason Carpenter (2007) pointed out that utilitarian value is an important factor for consumers who shop at discount retailers. Davis and Hodges (2012) focused on the shopping trip value to investigate the retail format and in-store value differentiation between department store and mass merchandisers. They found that that both carry variety and selection but department stores focus on fashion products with higher markups, extensive customer service and an entertaining shopping aura. Mass merchandisers, on the other hand, are giving consumers better options in terms of price and a fast, convenient shopping trip. On the other hand, according to Investment Adviser (2008), smaller retail formats known as boutique fashion stores are a growing trend in fashion retailing. A fashion clothing boutique is a specialized producer or provider. The owners are usually fashion innovators or leaders, and are ambitious to bring something forward to their customers; in addition, they are proudly providing an interesting place for the fashion hunters to relax and engage with not only the exclusive fashion goods that have been handpicked by the owners themselves, but also to chat and exchange views on trends, fashion and arts (McCausland 2010). 2.3.2. Trend and Fashion Information Sources Jong's study (2002) found that magazines, newspapers, catalogs, television, the Internet, family members, personal experiences and more are important sources for fashion consumers to

15

gain information about apparel (2002: 34). Window display is another significant instrument and resource for consumers to acquire information about clothing and clothing trends (Sen, Block & Chandran 2002: 277). Kubek (2012) studied the relationship between the fashion leadership and fashion-related information sources, and suggested that fashion magazines, shopping catalogs, the Internet, and window shopping are the main trend and fashion information sources for the majority of clothing shoppers (Kubek 2012). Brittany Thompson (2011) conducted a study on the influence of women's health magazines on aging women and pointed out that the fashion and lifestyle magazines in the market nowadays that talk about lifestyle choices, fitness, female body image, apparel trends, and colour are one of the top options for women who are seeking fashion and trend information (Thompson 2011). To speak of the television market share, the number of U.S. households owning televisions (TVs) went from 6% in 1949 to 97% in 1966 (Bull 2005). Paul (2003) pointed out that most boomers consider television their primary source of entertainment and spend four hours a day on watching television (2003); magazine is only considered as somewhat important. In David F. Smith's study on the baby boomers' relationship between branding and television (2008), he found that baby boomers are heavy television watchers and are highly receptive to television information (Smith 2008).

Chapter 3: Methodology 3.1. Research Method & Design Most prior research studies on female baby boomers that are related to fashion and clothing (Roberts & Manolis 2000; Lee & Huh 2004; Reisenwitz & Iyer 2007) are quantitative surveybased, and they don't shed much light on how women perceive changes (i.e., physical, social and psychological change) over the course of their lives. Qualitative methods allow for a more indepth study of when, why, and how consumers think, feel and behave during the process of fashion consumption over the years (Montemurro & Gillen, 2013). Due to the human subjects that were involved in this research, obtaining ethic research approval was mandatory (Appendix A). The semi-structured interview was employed for this study which means that some of the interview questions were pre-defined, so some predetermined topics that had no individual conceptions could be discussed, such as demographics, colour palette preferences, clothing styles, shopping channels, etc.; while some other open-ended interview questions allowed respondents to express their ideas and speak freely in their own terms ­ for example, participants could give their opinions about the meaning of aging and describe their decisions regarding postretirement lifestyles (Krippendorff 2004). The interview questions (Appendix D & E) consisted of three parts, and was conducted at each participant's home. Part 1 included questions related to demographics and clothing consumption, including shopping behaviour, spending habits, fashion information sources, purchasing motives and evaluative criteria. For example, participants were asked to list their reasons and selection criteria for clothing purchases, and what type of shopping options they used. In Part 2, visual stimuli were employed to explore participants' clothing preferences. They were asked to select their favourite colour palette out of four different ones, and also to choose their preferred styles from among four illustrations (see Figure 3, 4 & 5). The

17

colour palettes and fashion illustrations were adopted from Chu & Nemeth (2010) and the WGSN (2012) respectively. Due to the nature of this research, if a potential subject declared that she had visual impairment/colour-vision deficiency, she would not be recruited for this research study. In addition, participants were reminded that if viewing images caused them any discomfort, they could withdraw from the study at any time. In Part 3, participants were asked about their daily activities, social lives, important life events, health and well-being. Following the completion of her interview, the subject was asked to present and describe her wardrobe freely, covering such topics as usage experience and memories associated with the clothing. If a participant did not want her wardrobe to be viewed and photographed, she could opt not to participate in this part of the research. The interview questions were originally developed in English, and the back-translation method was used to prepare the Chinese version for use in Taiwan (Brislin 1986). The interview questions were then pre-tested on a sample of two Taiwanese in Toronto to identify any potential problems and ambiguities; any necessary amendments were made prior to the actual interview in Taiwan. 3.2 Research Sampling & Subject Recruitment In order to gain in-depth understanding and insights into how baby boomers behave and consume on purchasing clothing in Taiwan, one-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted with 18 female participants aged from 47 to 59 years old in this study. Many scholars have provided different numbers as a guideline on how many interviews should be conducted in a qualitativebased research. Guest, Bunch and Johnson (2006) asserted that data theme saturation is normally achieved after 12 interviews ( Edwards & Holland 2013); In other words, 15 interviews should be enough to collect sufficient data for the present study and look into the details of how selected

18

participants experience in clothing purchase (Brinkmann 2013). In addition, it is also recommended that 20 interviews should be conducted for master and 50 for doctoral theses (Edwards & Holland 2013). According to some studies (Franzosi 2008; Zhang & Wildemuth 2009; Brinkmann 2013; Edwards & Holland 2013), using a qualitative approach with in-depth interviews allows researchers to explore personal opinions and viewpoints, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of how consumers think, feel and act over the course of clothing consumption. It is important to note that qualitative research methods focus on the personal experiences and the changing phenomena of our society (Chen 2002). Through interviews, researchers can explore any unexpected or unknown personal thoughts and phenomena(Strauss & Corbin 1990). Some studies clearly revealed that surveys and questionnaires alone cannot capture the richness of consumers' affections, psychological states, and socio-cultural changes (Strauss & Corbin 1990). As a result, qualitative research methods were deemed to be more effective for the present study. Although this study employed some basic statistical analysis to describe the demographic data, the vast majority of the data was analyzed through content analysis and interpretive methods. The selection criteria of the participants included their age, gender and willingness to share their consumption experiences and information about their personal wardrobes. Subjects were recruited through direct referral and snowball sampling. The target participants were primarily recruited through personal contacts and the principal researcher's social network of relatives and friends. Each interview lasted between about 30 minutes and 2 hours. Prior to the interview, each subject was asked to read and sign an informed consent form (Appendix B & C), which explained the purpose of the study, and reassured the subject regarding the confidentiality and anonymity of her responses. Participation in this study was on a voluntary basis, and participants

19

were informed that they were free to withdraw from the interview whenever they didn't wish to continue. If the subject agreed to participate in this study, she was also asked for consent for the researcher to audio-record the interview and capture photographic images of her wardrobe. 3.3 Analysis Method Although this study employed statistical analysis to describe demographic data, the vast majority of the data was analyzed through content analysis and interpretive methodology. Content analysis is an objective, systematic and quantitative method of studying social science (Franzosi 2008). Counting the text content gives the idea of precision, rigour, exactitude, quantity and systematization in psychological research. Text content can be taken from personal documents, diaries, letters, speeches, interviews, focus-group data and so on (Krippendorff 2004). It maps out the flow and correlation between the text content and various psychological variables of the subjects, such as attitudes, emotional arousal, cognitive processes, personality traits, psychopathologies and worldviews (Krippendorff 2004), which helps researchers to understand social reality in a subjective but scientific manner (Zhang &Wildemuth 2009). In this study, qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data that were collected from 18 individual interviews. This method goes beyond merely counting words or extracting objective content from texts, but rather extends to examine meanings, themes and patterns that may be manifested in a particular text (Zhang &Wildemuth 2009). Interpretive methodology on the other hand, uses a qualitative approach to discover how people understand and execute their major life experiences (Smith, Flowers & Larkin 2009). The process of content analysis is guided by the research question (Krippendorff 2004). In this study, the method of analysis included several processes. First, each digital audio-recording was transcribed in Chinese, and then translated into English. Two bilingual individuals were asked to review and ensure that the meanings of English

20

translations were the same as Chinese. Second, important statements, meaningful phrases and words were identified during the analysis of interviews. Third, a coding system was developed to identify both predefined and emerging themes, and each theme was colour-coded. Fourth, significant common themes were identified and extracted from all the coding.

Chapter 4: Result & Discussion 4.1. Demographics In total, 18 female mature consumers aged from 47 to 59 years of age participated in this study, and the mean age was 52.8. These women were considered as younger baby boomers (Reisenwitz & Iyer 2007) and relatively educated. Due to the compulsory nine-year education program in Taiwan (Hsiao 2006), all of them had earned a high-school diploma, and seven of them had completed higher education with a college diploma and university degree. Each respondent's family consisted of three to six members, and 12 respondents indicated that they still had children living with them (as indicated in Table 1).

Table 1: Respondent Profile R1~R18

In terms of employment status, 14 out of 18 respondents (78%) reported that they worked full-time; the other 4 respondents were homemakers. In addition to "homemaker," the occupations among the respondents included bank manager, operating manager, tutors and independent business owners. In addition, it is important to note that 10 respondents (55%) were considered as business owners or employers, which is also known as "laobanniang" (   i n Mandarin). In Scott Simon's (2003) study of Taiwanese female entrepreneurs, he particularly

23

addressed the concept of "thau-ke-niu" (   in Taiwanese) or l" aobanniang," which means "boss-lady" or "owner's wife." In general, the "thau-ke-niu" or "laobanniang " holds a key position or plays an important role within a company, and is not just a helper. In Taiwan, they are actually viewed as a boss, and they are actively involved in the daily operations of a company such as pitching ideas, making decisions, planning strategies and managing the capital flow. Apart from the "boss-lady," 2 respondents worked at a high managerial level, and 2 other respondents were private tutors. One of the respondents (R12) was a successful Independent Business Owner (IBO) and led many friends to join her multi-level marketing business, especially housewives or those who were looking for a second career after retirement. This kind of business model requires an extensive personal network and an active social life in order to solicit and recruit more sales representatives to sell the products as well as certain dream and lifestyle (Kuntze 2001). Interestingly, other than R12, two respondents (R6 and R11) also reported that they had been involved in a multi-level marketing business in the past. According to some prior studies, the younger boomers are "me-oriented," and they hold extremely high expectations on things that they value the most (Baby Boomer Market 2002; Reisenwitz & Iyer 2007). In this study, the result is echoing with the previous research about baby boomers, most of the respondents are educated, affluent and have less financial burden. As shown in Table 1, half of the respondents earned NT$ 800,000 ~ 3,200,000 (CAN$ 27,000 ~ 80,000) per year. This result is consistent with the Income Report published by Taiwanese National Statistics (2013), which showed that the average income per capita and spending per capita was NT$ 546,501 (US$18,358) and NT$ 371,265 (US$12,471) in 2012, respectively. In this study, three respondents (R2, R10 and R11) earned exceptionally high personal incomes because of their professions. However, the homemakers (R3, R6, R9, R15 and R16) clearly

24

received less personal income or spending allowances from their spouses. Despite the differences of personal income among the respondents, twelve of them earned 1.5 ~ 6 times more than the national average. In other words, the vast majority of the respondents belonged to the highincome bracket in Taiwan (Hong & Cheng, 2013). According to the findings, respondents' expenditures on clothing and footwear ranged from NT$ 30,000 ~ 500,000 (CAN$ 1,000 ~ 17,000) which is 1.2 ~ 20 times more than the national average, NT$ 25,396 (CAN$ 850). Clearly, this mature consumer segment has strong buying power for apparel. When compared to respondents in the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure Per Household by Age of Household Heads conducted by Taiwan National Statistics (2012), it not only proved that the Taiwanese age between 45 and 54 have the highest income and spending power in every categories. It is also reflected that most of the respondents in this study were classified as middle to high-class in Taiwan, and they were assumed to have more discretionary income to spend on symbolic goods such as fashion clothing. 4.2 Interpretive Analysis of Aging & Lifestyle The majority of the boomers are now approaching their fifties and sixties (Rock 2012), and they may experience different changes of social identity (pre-senior, retiree, widow, empty nester) and physical appearance (grey hair and wrinkles). Most of the respondents felt that grey hair is a sign of aging or "getting old." In order to look younger, many respondents dyed their hair black or brown. Other than grey hair, all the respondents stated that they also experienced different degrees of physiological change ­ weight gain, slowing metabolism, eye-related problems (i.e. Presbyopia), dry skin, and wrinkles (as indicated in Table 2). In addition, some respondents also explained that due to osteoarthritis, the problem of losing calcium in teeth and bones, they had to reduce or avoid acute exercise. Half of the respondents said that they felt

25

unhappy, depressed and gloomy about the process of aging. This finding is in line with a study conducted by Paquette and Raine (2004), which found that aging is associated with an individual's physical and psychological state. Several respondents said that the reason they felt moody, tired and depressed, and had hot flushes and bad sleeping quality, was mainly due to their current life stage ­ i.e., entering and experience menopause.

Table 2: Sign of Aging

In general, the majority of the respondents wanted to stay young. Previous research on baby boomers has already reported the differences between chronological age and cognitive age (Wray & Hodges 2008) ­ many boomers felt and acted younger than their chronological age. Overall, cognitive age including the "look age", "health age", "think age" and "interest age", could be perceived 5 to 10 years younger than chronological age (Wray & Hodges 2008). Interestingly, all the respondents in the current study believed that they looked much younger than their parents at the same life stage due to the advancement of healthcare and medicine, better skin-care products, and being more educated and health conscious. The majority of the respondents reported that they often received compliments about their physical appearance such as "You look young," "You don't look like your age," "You are still in pretty good shape," and
26

"You and your daughter look like siblings." Some other respondents did mention that due to urbanization and industrialization, people have a faster-paced lifestyle and have more stress, and exhaustion could cause acceleration of the aging process. In order to further understand the participants' attitudes and behaviour toward aging, they were asked to elaborate their ways of staying young and healthy. Based on the interview transcriptions, six different ways were identified: (1) mild exercise, (2) outdoor activities, (3) healthy diet, (3) self-improvement, (4) positive attitude, (5) religious activities, and (6) interact with others. In addition, many respondents indicated that they had adopted a regular exercise and relaxation routine, such as yoga, massage, sauna, spa, jogging, aerobic dancing, fast walking and mountain climbing. Some respondents also paid close attention to what they ate. Instead of feeling stressed about aging, half of the respondents were optimistic about aging, and often adjusted their attitudes and think more positively toward life. To fight against the word "old," many respondents suggested that people should not stop learning. Many of them stated that they involved and attended many activities including reading clubs, financial management workshops, flower-arrangement class, painting and cooking lessons. In addition, some respondents enjoyed visiting galleries, exhibitions, going to concerts and travelling abroad. According to their responses (R1, R6, R10 and R11), being active in the community and participate in different activities makes them feel alive and energetic. In terms of the retirement age, the majority of the respondents did not plan to retire from the workplace in the next 10 to 15 years. Some respondents felt that retirement means staying home and leading to isolation. Other respondents believed that it was not the time to retire because they had the responsibility to take care of their offspring and also to save more money for retirement. In addition, several respondents considered themselves already in the phase of semi-retirement

27

because they had been spending considerable amount of time in leisure activities.  Respondent 1: I am a workaholic and retirement means reducing the chance to meet more people. Besides, I have 3 kids studying abroad and I will try my best to give them plentiful financial support.  Respondent 12: Being successful in my work delays my time of retirement.

Table 3: Social Activities

As one of the prosperous Eastern cultures, Taiwan's social activities are very much group28

oriented and commercially driven. As is true with the Japanese, a collectivist lifestyle (Osajima, Sternquist & Manjeshwar 2010) pushes socialization beyond business and into the personal lives of the constituents. Western culture is aimed more toward self-interested activity, consequently, individual leisure time after work is often pursued (Whyte 2002). There is an expectation that social life is primarily for relaxation and finding balance toward personal goals in life. In contrast, Taiwanese business and work usually moves onto the dinner table and most activities are aimed at building social connections for business reasons. In this study, I found that employment status is an important criterion of determining social activities and lifestyle, as well as clothing preferences. Most of the respondents described their social life as somewhat active. They differentiated between work-oriented and leisure entertainments in their social life activities. Work-oriented occasions, such as company annual parties, business dinner events and banquets, all require specific garments that represented status and position. Outside of work, family gatherings or meeting with friends made up the majority of social events. The baby boomers in Taiwan are considered to have the same behaviour as Canadian baby boomers in that they dress themselves on the basis of their lifestyles and personality (Spadaro 2012). Their lifestyle is usually defined by their careers, their childrearing status, income levels, community involvement and leisure activities (Howarton & Lee 2010). 10 out of the 18 respondents in our study were the co-owners of their businesses and had an important say in decision-making; moreover, they saw themselves as the public image on behalf of their company, so showing up with professional and appropriate clothing on business occasions was a vital basis for their dressing. According to the respondents, the one-piece dress can give not only the feeling of professional comfort but also feminine grace. It was suggested that the tenacity and flexibility of Taiwanese women are special skills to be successful in negotiating business (Simon

29

2003). This could also suggest that Taiwan is a gender-driven society; i.e., that women are constantly using their "soft power." In terms of aging and lifestyle, the study from Meng Hong, Lee (Lee 2013) are trying to understand the relationship among the Taiwanese mature segmentation's lifestyles, clothing values and the shopping values of functional clothing. The results identified five types of lifestyles; including "Confidence", "Achiever", "Conservative", "Struggler" and "Carelessness" (Lee 2013). In this paper, participants are also placed into four types of lifestyles based on different profession and social life. To summarize the variety of lifestyles among the participants in this study, the principle researcher came across 4 types of lifestyle: Type I was professional and active; Type II was professional with conservative; Type III was carefree and active and Type IV was carefree with conservative.

Table 4: Type of Lifestyle

 Type I: Respondents describe their life as mingling work and social activities together. They described themselves as outgoing and creative. Connecting with potential work partners and clients was their goal.  Type II: Respondents who fell into this category were considered workaholics. They strictly separated their personal lives from the professional workplace. Family gatherings were their social priority.  Type III: Respondents without full-time jobs tended to spend substantial amount of time on active social and outdoor activities. Meeting new friends, and learning new knowledge and skills was the focus of their lives.
30

 Type IV: These respondents preferred to stay at home and spend their time with their family most of the time.
Type I

Respondent 11: "Extravagance" is how I describe my social life. I work as a partner
with my husband so I constantly act on his behalf or the company to meet with the clients. On the weekend, I can't stand myself staying at home so I always call out my friends to go for tea, shopping and art galleries. I can hang out with my art classmates from noon till 8 or 9 pm and then call some other friends to join us, moving to another place and continue chatting and gossiping until late 11pm.

Type II

Respondent 1: Family and work is my focus of life. My social life is simple, either
spending time at work, meeting my parents and siblings or accompanying my husband to business dinner events.

Type III

Respondent 6: I am a housewife and I am glad that I have a group of close friends that we attend class together at university and share life experiences. We accompany and support each other when our kids are studying and working out of town. Respondent 9: I have 5 sisters and we live very close to each other so our families often
get together when we have time. Table 5: Lifestyle Representatives

4.3. Interpretive Analysis on Inherent clothing Preference The eighteen respondents were asked to describe their own personal styles and their preferences for apparel. Product attributes, styling attributes, and style preferences for tops, trousers and skirts, and colour preferences were discussed. The styles were identified by silhouettes, including a one-piece dress, narrow-waist top, pear-shape, sleeveless, high-waist trousers and so on. As was true of Canadian baby boomers in their fifties (Spadaro 2012), most respondents preferred the silhouette of the garments that flattered their figures without being too clingy or too baggy. All of the respondents were asked to describe the "must-have" apparel they had in their wardrobes, and one-piece dresses were the most popular style among these Taiwanese baby boomers. This result was supported by the evidence of photography from the respondents' wardrobe visit (Figure 2).

4.3.1. Product Attribute The results collected from the interviews showed that the major concern of clothing purchase was the quality. In this research study, "quality" was referred to texture, fabric and comfort of the garments. The respondents indicated that at their age, they would prefer clothing with high quality and better workmanship even if it might cost them more money. Some respondents stated that the hand or feel of the fabric was important. Style and colour were the next-most-important attributes, which associated with the garment silhouette and personal preference. In this study, there was a huge discrepancy among subjects on the question of brand preference. Some respondents did mention that they referenced brand when they shop for clothing, but said that it was surely not the most critical factor. Four respondents (R4, R7, R11, & R17) even used strong descriptions to propose that brand name is the last thing they would consider. It is reasonable to
32

suggest that Taiwanese elderly female consumers are fashion non-innovators and negative on fashion fanship (Bilozerova 2010), which also implies that they are not loyal to any brand name. One of the respondents stated that people who trust a brand to a great extent must really lack confidence in themselves, so they have to rely on the image and the style that was portrayed by the company and delivered through its marketing strategy. Function, fit and price were also discussed among other clothing attributes during interview. The respondents in this study were considered as pragmatic and body conscious. In general, they were confidence and knew what they wanted to buy ­ quality and variety of styles were important to this demographic group. However, many respondents were skeptical about marketing strategies, particularly those presented by the giant clothing brands. This finding is somewhat consistent with a study conducted by Osajima, Sternquist & Manjeshwar (2010), Japanese baby boomers are not brand loyal although they are willing to try out different products offered by different retailers, and/or recommendations through word-of-mouth marketing.

4.3.2. Styling Attribute The respondents in this study had strong opinions on how to dress themselves. Without following trends, they have their own definite view on styling and dressing up. Dressing appropriately for the occasion was the top priority for the respondents when it comes to styling themselves. In the work environment, looking formal and professional is important. When it is time for sports or exercise, functional garments are needed. When attending dinner events or party banquets, dresses express individuality, creativity and femininity. These women mentioned that they often attend social occasions with their husbands, and the men do have some influence and opinion on how they like their female companion to dress. Some respondents implied that since they are not working in such areas as the law, banking or government enforcement, they have more liberal power on deciding what to wear to work, especially when they are the owners. Colour collaboration and embellishing accessories are both crucial styling attribute for all the respondents. Body image is still a criterion for mature women in their choice of clothing. Some
34

respondents pointed out that styling themselves must take comfort and skin colour into account. It became evident when viewing their wardrobes that the respondents in this study liked various kinds of one-piece dresses in a diversity of colour, length, and prints as well as cutting. Respondents pointed out that one-piece dresses come with a variety designs, and can either be casual or formal for different occasions. They also said that the one-piece dress is their first choice because of its convenience.

4.3.3. Top Besides the one-piece dress, the respondents were also asked to pick out their preference on tops, skirts and trousers, using guides established in Janelle Spadaro's (2012) study on Canadian female baby boomers' style choices. In the category of the top, Style 3 was the favourite choice, followed by Style 1. Style 3 is a shell top that A-lines with a collapsed boat neckline and a bracelet-length sleeve (Spadaro 2012). Many respondents liked Style 3 because of its versatility in matching with a range of the bottoms including trousers and skirts. Respondent R13 described Style 3 as a comfortable garment for the workplace with enough space for stretching and moving. Respondent R7 pointed out that Style 3 is really a dressy form of a casual t-shirt which

36

can be adopted for not only the office working environment but also for leisure activities. By contrast, instead of using long sleeves to cover her arms, Respondent R11 tended to choose the design with no sleeves (like Style 4) or untied sleeves that are more comfortable to wear and more convenient to move around. The waist of Style 1 accentuates a long top with a broad shoulder line and cut-off sleeves (Spadaro 2012). Respondent R1 liked everything that can emphasize her tiny waist so Style 1was her first choice. Respondent R3 also preferred these options, stating that something that is more fitted to the body can showcase a feminine waistline. Respondents R12 and R16 both liked Style 1, pointing out that its pattern has more design elements. They felt it could be worn as a dressing top since the narrow-waist design has a similar look to peplum. They went further to point out that this style goes well with denim jeans or skinny trousers because it gives the Coca-Cola bottle shape that accentuates the female waist and buttocks. Style 4, which is sleeveless with a low-neck, and Style 5 with the button-up collar design were the two least favourite styles among the respondents. Respondent R3 specifically stated that Style 4 was a less favourite option for her. She preferred a round neck over a V-neck, and found sleeveless tops very uncomfortable to wear, since both might show too much of her upper body. Respondent R7 also said that Style 4 would be very inconvenient for working in an air-conditioned environment, because it would be too cold, and it would be inappropriate to wear just a sleeveless top with such a low neck design. However, she felt it would be too hot to put on a cardigan. Respondent R16 also strongly stated that a sleeveless shirt is for younger girls and said she would never wear a sleeveless top without a small jacket. Style 4, however, was chosen by respondent R1 because she is very comfortable showing her slim arms and proud of her wellrounded bosom. Respondent R5 considered Style 5 too boxy. Respondents R2, 16 and 17 felt the design of the buttons in Style 5 were complicated, and respondent R1 implied that the collar

37

design is uncomfortable to wear. However, respondent R4 and 8 were fond of Style 5 because they felt that the formal blouse look gives a professional and upstanding image. Respondent R9 expressed her preference for the decency of the collar design.

4.3.4. Skirts & Trousers Most respondents felt that it is important for females to wear skirts in public because they portray a feminine image, and insisted that the best length for them is just above the knee. Style 2 was the most popular skirt among the respondents because it displayed a good portion of their legs, conformed to the simple silhouette, and had a higher collaboration with various tops. Responses indicated that the respondents were confident showing their skinny legs due to the petite size of most Asian women. Still, they felt that wearing black or beige silk socks underneath was necessary to be age-appropriate and not too provocative. On the other hand, some respondents felt that wearing a skirt that was above their knees was not appropriate at their age, or felt they were not confident enough to show off their thick thighs and legs and thought they needed to be covered. Some felt that the hem of the skirt should not be too low to the ankle, as was the case in Style 3 and Style 5. Style 3 was loved by some of the respondents due to its slim and elegant look, and it also had the advantage of covering their muscled lower legs. Some felt that Style 5 was too complicated to wear, and outdated. Some respondents associated Style 1 with pleated skirts, which are also considered to be old-fashioned and to make the wearer look bigger as for the trousers, most comments from the respondents related to the length and the cut. A good pair of trousers gives the image of well-executed, which requires a better cut and fabric to cover the enlarged part of the thighs. Respondents responded positively to the concept of wearing fitted ankle-length trousers, such as Style 4 and Style 5, due to their professional and edgy look. In addition, respondents were asked to provide their opinions on leggings, and most said they were acceptable pieces when worn with longer version tops that cover the triangle space where the legs join. A few respondents suggested that those who wear leggings are trying to look "cute," and they said they were not fans. Some of the respondents also addressed their

39

fondness for denim jeans due to their convenient function and ability to be worn with other garments. The trousers with higher waists were not preferred by the respondents because they felt they might emphasize protruding lower abdomens. Trouser option number 1 was seen as suitable for casual occasions, as for sports or home wear. 4.3.5. Colour Palette Referencing the four colour palettes that were created by colour specialist Alice Chu, all respondents were asked to select their preferred colour hue for clothes and to explain the reason for their choices. There could be difference in Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter. Some respondents believed that colour could reflect their personality and taste,and convey the image they have in mind to others, while others just accept colours as visual stimuli and pick them out by personal preference. Moreover, a lot of respondents indicated that they consider their skin tones as an important criterion when they think about colour for clothing.

For this research, based on the result, the four colour palettes were redefined and given a clearer expression of clothing personality. Results indicate that those elderly consumers who are affected more by social influence tend to choose younger styles and high-saturated colours. In this study, Colour Palette 1, warm and soft, was the most popular choice with 39% of the respondents. The reason might be obvious that as they reach their fifties, these baby boomers want to brighten up their look and project a youthful image by adopting the highly saturated colours available in Colour Palette 1. Some respondents suggested that they used to wear dark tones when they were young but now they like the colour that lightens their mood and their skin tone. Colour Palette 4, cold and intense, had the second highest percentage of votes, at 28%. It has been said that Colour Palette 4 goes well with the Asian skin colour (Chu & Nemeth 2012); also it is a favourite colour combination in winter when everything looks dull and grayish, due to its highlight function. This colour palette was also believed by some of the respondents to convey a heavy, luxurious but elegant feeling. Colour Palette 3, cold and soft, (19%) and Colour Palette 2, warm and intense, (14%) were not so popular among the respondents. Both were considered more quiet and professional. While some suggested that Colour Palette 3 looks turbid and dirty, it still had supporters, who claimed that they were fascinated by the gentle and refined mood. On the other hand, Colour Palette 2 had a strong earth-tone value with brown, dark green and muddy yellow; respondents who tended to be more carefree and moderate liked this Colour Palette. Colour preferences among the respondents were categorized into 4 colour palettes which reflected the respondents' personality, attitude toward aging and the consideration of their shade of skin. For example, R18 who preferred colour Palette 1 consisted of many strong hue and highsaturated colours, which expressed the attitudes of being youthful and vivid; respondent like R1

41

who chose colour Palette 2, which is a much more earth tone of brown and green colours, held carefree, lighthearted but professional value; respondent like R3 who were fond of colour Palette 3, which accentuate a grey-ish blue and violet tint, gave a professional but demure feminine look; lastly, respondent like R11 who love colour Palette 4, which owns more cold heavy and royal colours, presented a gracefully luxurious attitude. This result was validated with the items found in respondents' wardrobes (Appendix G).

4.4. Interpretive Analysis of Shopping Behaviour and Habits Taiwan is a prosperous capitalist state with a very open society and culture. In major cities such as Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung, people relatively high purchasing power and can literally go shopping just by stepping out of their homes. According to Tsai (2010), Taiwan is a shallow-dish economy greatly affected by many external factors. Thus, it is important for a company to have a vision to foresee the future trends, as well as to fully understand Taiwanese consumers' needs in order to succeed in today's competitive retail market. In addition, the author suggests that apparel exporters and designers should consider the characteristics of Asian consumers when they design and develop their products ­ e.g., skin tone, hair colour, height, and body type (Tsai 2010). According to a study published by the U.S. Commercial Service (Tsai 2010), Taiwanese consumers spent about 4% of their household income on apparel. Due to the influence of mass media, such as movies, TV shows and pop music, Taiwanese are familiar with American, Japanese, and Korean cultures (Tsai 2010). According to some studies (e.g., Yang 2012), Korean music, TV drama and fashion have become popular and widely accepted in Taiwan, and this phenomenon is known as the "Korean Wave" or "Hallyu" (Yang 2012).

4.4.1. Shopping Channels Department stores were the most instinctive choice for apparel shopping among the respondents because they offer a wide range of products to satisfy the diverse consumers' needs, and the product classifications are clearly presented to different age groups. Taiwan is relatively a small country so huge shopping malls are not common. Most of the department stores are located in downtown prime areas and they are easy to reach by various public transportations (e.g., bus and subway). However, some of the respondents expressed that they did not enjoy shopping at the department store because they did not want to be bothered or pushed by the sales associates. Besides the department stores, some respondents said that boutiques were the second most favourite place to shop for clothing. Those who like to shop at the boutiques said that they enjoyed the one-on-one customer service. The boutique owners were familiar with participants' tastes, body size and preferences; and the owners served as their personal stylist/shopper. Many respondents claimed that a lot of boutique owners have similar taste about clothing styles as they do, and they sourced and imported new clothing styles for the respondents from different popular fashion cities in Asia including Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul. Those who were more fashion/trend-conscious loved the privilege of having the store owner to inform them regarding the arrival of new merchandise. Thus, they could enjoy the opportunity to review, select and purchase the products first hand. Respondents stated that they didn't like to spend too much time looking for what they need, and boutique owners could help them to find the appropriate and fashionable styles more efficiently and effectively. Although the retail prices of new products are generally quite high, the boutiques owners sometimes offer certain discounts to them, which imply that they are eager to build a good relationship with their customers, as well as to establish long-term business with these women who have abundant disposable income and plenteous

45

allowances to spend on clothing.

4.4.2 Fashion Information Sources In terms of fashion information source, respondents cited window display and store catalogues as the two most important sources, followed by fashion magazines. Interestingly, several respondents mentioned that they were influenced by Japanese fashion and lifestyle magazines, such as ViVi. Friends and family also exerted influence on their clothing choice, as well as fashion information and sales promotion. It is important to note that the family members who shared fashion news and information with these respondents were usually their daughters. Mothers and daughters also exchanged clothing from their wardrobes. Moreover, television was also considered one of the information sources for clothing purchases. This result is consistent with a study conducted by Nam, Hamlin, Gam, Kang, Kim, Kumphai, Starr & Richards (2007), authors found that many consumers relied on television for fashion information. Many television lifestyle programs offer valuable suggestions and information on fashion styles and trends. Some respondents who were more fashion conscious and technological savvy tended to use the Internet to search for fashion information. In addition to the aforementioned fashion information sources, travelling abroad, personal tailor and trade/fashion shows were mentioned by a few respondents during the interviews.

Chapter 5: Conclusion The results of this paper indicated that the vast majority of the respondents experienced the effects and affects of aging. Although respondents were experiencing physiological, social and psychological change during the process of aging, many expressed a true desire to stay young, healthy and active in their social life. Based on the interview transcriptions, it is evident that clothing selection and consumption were closely associated in the spheres of work, social status and daily life. Within this context, this study explored and attempted to understand the experience of aging for female baby boomers in Taiwan and also the socio-cultural contexts of clothing usage and consumption. Respondents were placed into four types of lifestyle dimensions based on different profession and social life. Type I is "professional and active"; Type II is "professional and conservative"; Type III is "carefree and active" and Type IV is "carefree and conservative". Each group had unique values toward clothing, specifically with perceptions toward functionality through determinants of value: efficiency, moral, economic, aesthetic, and social. Respondents belonged in Type I are more like 'boss lady' characteristics with dynamic social life in both the work and leisure sphere; respondents belonged in Type II tend to have more focus on profession sphere and spare free time only for intimate family members; respondents who fell into Type III focused primarily on meeting people outside the workplace or in their semi-retirement stage of life, and trying to explore their new life goals; and respondents who fell into Type IV are considered not engaged in work anymore and also preferred less frequent social activities. Next, this paper systematically categorized clothing choices from the target group. This organization gives insight between the relationships among the Taiwanese mature demographic lifestyles, values toward clothing, desired product attributes, style attributes, preference of tops,

48

trousers, and skirts, as well as the colour preferences. It was defined by the respondents that they were looking for graceful pieces in the market, instead of trendy or classic. They still desired fashion products that are interesting and feminine, but notably, without making them stand out too much in the crowd. Results also indicated that the utility from clothing depends on the social situation. According to the respondents, a one-piece dress is the most popular and must-have apparel because it holds both practical and aesthetic functions. Quality is the most important product attribute among the respondents, followed by style and colour, which were also being discussed further in the paper. Generally speaking, different choice of style and colour in apparel are correlated to the respondents' personality and everyday routines, including work, exercise or social events. In terms of tops, respondents tend to look for the piece that is matchable to many kinds of other bottoms. Even though some of the respondents did show some concern on wearing the clothing that exposed too much about their body parts, some other respondents were quite confident to show their nice figure due to their commitment to regular exercise. Still, the length of skirts and trousers above the knee are not popular among the respondents because it is said to be immodest. Colour preference among the respondents were also categorized into 4 colour palettes which were believed to associated with the respondents' personality, attitude toward aging and the consideration of their shade of skin. Colour Palette 1, with strong hue and highsaturated colours, expressing an eager attitude of being youthful and vivid; colour Palette 2, with a much more earth tone of brown and green colours, implying a carefree, lighthearted but with professional value; colour Palette 3, with grey-ish blue and violet tint, giving a professional but demure feminine look; lastly, colour Palette 4, with cold heavy and royal colours, presenting a gracefully luxurious attitude. Results indicate that those female entrepreneurs who are affected more by social influence tend to choose younger styles and high-saturated colours. With regards

49

to purchasing, department stores ranked as the most popular option among the respondents. Malls are perceived as having good quality inventory, choice and selection, and of note, due to land constraints, large retail spaces are few in contrast to the North American retail environment. Some, such as "boss ladies" like to shop at the boutiques or specialty stores because of special attentions and services. With regard to fashion-related points of reference, window displays and store catalogs were preferred. Magazine, friends and family were also important reference when it comes to clothing shopping. Another compelling insight was that many fashion information sources were direct; mostly from Taiwanese female friends and acquaintances in a wide age spectrum who incidentally were reported to be currently influenced by the Korean fashion in television dramas. Lastly, this study identified a contrast between Taiwanese boomers and Western boomers. Many participants were satisfied with the diversification and proliferation of clothing styles offered in the Taiwanese market. This finding is inconsistent with many prior research studies conducted in Western societies. Unlike previous research ( Birtwistle & Tsim 2005; Reisenwitz & Iyer 2007; Kwon & Noh 2010; Holmlund, Hagman & Polsa 2011; Spadaro 2012) which point to a dissatisfaction to the Western apparel market, generally speaking, mature Taiwanese females are satisfied with the diversity of products available within the apparel market.

Table 12: Comparison of Western Boomers & Taiwanese Boomers The distinction in the baby boomers' psychographic profiles look at differences in cultural background, social construction and financial situation. Cultural differences could appear in standards of attractiveness, as well as in lifestyle, access to food supply, economic resources, social power and gender construction (Pierce 2000). Western studies indicate that their boomers strongly rejected to be old or be thought as old; Taiwanese boomers, on the other hand, were quite carefree about maturing by saying that following they are along a natural path, and a positive attitude was the best way to encounter old. Consistent with this view, the respondents in this study showcased an attitude of being liberal and have the right to control over their second half of their lives, especially if she spent her early adulthood gaining access to economic resources through building a successful career, they are able to provide better for offspring conceived later in life (Piece 1999). In regards to physical differences, it is observed that Taiwanese female boomers possessed relatively petite size compared to Western boomers and frequent exercise allows them to keep in shape. The responses provided herein indicate that Asian baby boomers are more satisfied with retail apparel due their petite body sizes and content mentality toward later life. With the aforementioned information, leveraging and expanding
51

clothing sales would require more focus on variety design on patterns, colours for mature consumers' which can stimulate their desire of purchasing apparel. Also, developing processes and procedures on providing exclusive and thoughtful customer service can satisfy the savvy boomers. On social activities, both Western boomers and Taiwanese boomers indicated that they are presently more focused on individual interests, self-cultivation and personal connections when they enter their semi-retirement stage of life; however, much strong commentary was made that the social life of Taiwanese is still very business-oriented and work-related. As mentioned earlier in this dissertation, the mature Taiwanese demographic reflects a different character and image of boomer as the traditional boomers known from Western studies. Due to the substantially complex and large demographics, high confidence in causation and correlation is limited by economic, social and regional factors, which may not represent the diverse baby boomer population beyond this context (e.g. globally). Moreover, this sample of this study is restricted to a specific segment (middle to upper-class) which may not represent the entire baby boomer populations in Taiwan. This limited phenomenological research points to numerous topics for further clothing research on Asian boomers. Further research can be done to understand the inter-web that exists amongst personal wardrobes, lifestyles, public and private life. Nevertheless, this unique study is helpful in expanding the current understanding of aging and apparel preferences of the lucrative baby boomer generation in Asian market. To sum up, this study should provide valuable information to international fashion practitioners, marketers and academia, as well as enrich our knowledge of aging populations and clothing consumption in Taiwan.

C. Purpose of the Study  The purpose of this study is to provide in-depth and insightful information on female baby boomers' shopping behavior and colour choice. Preliminary research on baby boomers revealed that many prior apparel studies merely focus on Western boomers.
