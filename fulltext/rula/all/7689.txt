JOB-EDUCATION MATCH & TENURE AMONG YOUNG CANADIANS: EVIDENCE FROM THE 1997 & 2014 LABOUR FORCE SURVEY by Michael Turk Master of Science in Management, Ryerson University, 2018

Abstract In response to the growing supply of postsecondary education graduates and the persistence of overqualification in the Canadian labour market, this study investigates the relationship between the levels of job-education match and tenure among young workers, 25 to 34 years of age, relative to the remaining workforce ages 35 to 64, using a job analysis (JA) approach based on skill levels defined by the National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2011 and education credentials defined by Statistics Canada. Using the 1997 and 2014 Labour Force Survey (LFS) files, a significant negative relationship is observed between length of tenure and overqualified workers, and a significant positive relationship with underqualified workers, in addition to significant differences in the effect that being over/underqualified has on tenure based on respondents' age and survey year. Implications for individual, organizational, and societal stakeholders involved in the schoolto-work transition are discussed.

Keywords: educational attainment, job analysis approach, job-education match, mismatch, overqualification, overeducation, tenure, underemployment.

Chapter 1: Introduction Postsecondary education is an area of interest for a variety of stakeholders: students, teaching faculty, career advisers, employers, educational institutions, and government (Scurry & Blenkinsopp, 2011). A persisting topic in the discourse has been the labour market outcomes of graduates; several Canadian studies, for example, have utilized cross-sectional datasets to estimate the returns to education (Finnie, 2000; Finnie & Frenette, 2003; Walters, 2004; Boudarbat, Lemieux, & Riddel, 2010; Betts et al., 2013; Fenesi & Sana, 2015). There is growing interest in educational attainment, and a growing supply of postsecondary graduates. Enrollment in higher education continues to increase in Canada, particularly at the university level. According to a recent Statistics Canada (2016) report, 515,865 graduates obtained a credential from a postsecondary education institution between 2014 to 2015 (trades certificate, diploma, or degree), which is a 3.2% increase from the previous academic year, an upward trend since 2000 (Tal & Enenajor, 2013); on a global scale, Canada ranks highest in the proportion of post-secondary degree or diploma holders among OECD countries (OECD, 2016). What raises concerns for labour economists, management scholars, and employers alike, however, is the level of congruence or `fit' between job seekers and jobs; recent estimates suggest that "35.1% of graduates are in a job that is not closely related to their education" (Boudarbat & Chernoff, 2009). The present study defines overqualification as a situation in which "an individual possesses more education than required by the main employer" (Frenette, 2001, p. 41). The phenomenon of overqualification, also termed underemployment, will be measured through jobeducation match, which refers to the differences between required and attained levels of education (Allen et al., 2003). In the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario's (HEQCO) 2015 report on postsecondary performance, overqualification rates were estimated by province, which ranged



1

from 34% (Newfoundland and Labrador, Québec) to 44% (Saskatchewan) for university graduates (Weingarten et al., 2015). Canada's Parliamentary Budget Office measured labour utilization based on education credentials, relative to educational requirements in occupations, and estimates "the proportion of workers aged 25 to 34 with a university degree who were overqualified in their current position has been on an upward trend since the early 1990s, reaching 40% in 2014" (Office of the Parliamentary Budget Office, 2015, p. 2). These findings reiterate the prevalence of overqualification as a substantial element of the labour market experience for young Canadian workers. The Canadian Labour Congress has also raised questions regarding underemployment, considering that "the proportion of individuals who are at school but want a job has increased from 20% to nearly 30% over the past 15 years" (CLC, 2014, p. 4). According to the Conference Board of Canada's summary findings, the full-time employment rate of the 15-to-24-year-old cohort was at 45% in 1972, compared to 27% in 2014, which suggests Canada's system of skill development has transitioned from work/experiential learning toward longer school stays (Grant, 2016). The reasons for increasing enrollment can be explained partly by individuals' desire for successful careers. Ontario's Ministry of Education and Training found in a survey that "more than 80% of high school graduates pursue postsecondary education to increase employment opportunities and income" (King, Warren, Boyer, & Chin, 2002). This study investigates the incidence of underemployment based on the match between education credentials and job requirements in Canada. This job-education match measure is of interest to employers, particularly Human Resources Management (HRM) professionals, as the results can provide direction on the future allocation of resources in order to attract, select, and retain the right employees (HRPA, 2016). From the employer perspective, industry reports have regularly cited skills shortages as a key business challenge, despite the growing supply of



2

postsecondary graduates (Grant, 2016). In a recent survey conducted by the Human Resources Professionals Association (HRPA), the regulatory body for HR practitioners in Ontario, members were asked whether employees hired in the past year were adequately prepared by their pre-hire education and/or training; of the respondents, 43% agreed, and the remaining 57% either disagreed or were unsure, at 35% and 22% respectively (HRPA, 2016). Using a deductive approach, this study intends to contribute a better explanation of the fit between educational attainment and job requirements among young Canadians, and address a gap in the current literature which does not investigate underemployment patterns across time and between the young age cohort and the remaining working population. Labour market outcomes for young Canadians continues to be relevant in management and economics literature; "a major limitation of the past research on the earnings and employment outcomes of postsecondary graduates is that little attention has been devoted to making comparisons over time, for both graduates of different levels of schooling and fields of study" (Walters, 2004, p. 19). Based on the five-dimension framework created by Feldman (1996), an appropriate measure of underemployment is the extent to which individuals "possess more formal education than their current job requires" (Feldman, 1996). Within congruence literature, it is suggested that there are two main perspectives of underemployment: the objective and the subjective (Scurry & Blenkinsopp, 2011). To reflect the intended contribution of the present study to explain overqualification levels and tenure patterns, an objective measure is adopted, rather than a subjective, self-report measure reflecting individuals' perceptions of their employment situation. In this study, the job analysis approach is adopted, in which formal education credentials are compared to job requirements, and the outcomes of job-education match levels are used to estimate



3

whether overqualified individuals are more likely to have a shorter length of service in their primary job, across time and between age cohorts. For the purpose of this study, educational attainment or education credentials refer to the highest level of schooling completed by respondents of the Labour Force Survey (Statistics Canada, 2016). Based on the National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2011, occupations are defined as "a collection of jobs, sufficiently similar in work performed to be grouped under a common label for classification purposes", and a job is defined as "all the tasks carried out by a particular worker to complete their duties" (Statistics Canada, 2012, p. 7). While the occupational categories of the NOC are formed based on the most common tasks, duties, and responsibilities of each occupation, the employment requirements, specifically the details on the type and level of formal education associated with each occupation, are broad and often include a wide range of relevant education credentials. To allow for consistency in categorizing occupations based on education, the NOC 2011 skills matrix (see Appendix 3) is used, rather than the requirement details of each individual occupation. This thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 2 provides a review of the underemployment literature, with a focus on the measures, outcomes, theoretical approaches to interpreting underemployment, and prior empirical studies which focus on the phenomenon of educational attainment outcomes. Chapter 3 outlines the primary research question, with a set of supporting questions and hypotheses, as well as the dataset and methods used for analysis, followed by the summary results for each of the models (1997, 2014, and pooled) in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 provides a detailed discussion of these results as they relate to the hypotheses, and the implications of these results on key stakeholders, with an explanation of the limitations of the present study and



4

opportunities for future research. To conclude, Chapter 6 offers a few brief remarks to summarize the contributions of this study to the literature on underemployment.

Chapter 2: Literature Review 2.1 Definition & Measures of Underemployment Labour economists, management scholars, and sociologists use a variety of measurements to investigate underemployment, also termed overqualification or underutilization. Individuals working in a job that is below their full capacity, or inferior by some standard, are deemed underemployed or overqualified (McKee-Ryan & Harvey, 2011). The management perspective of underemployment, which focuses primarily on individual and organizational-level outcomes, investigates the fit between individuals' skills and job requirements. There are two main perspectives from which underemployment is assessed: the objective (Feldman, 1996) and the subjective (Khan & Morrow, 1991). The objective perspective, outlined by Feldman (1996), measures underemployment based on how an individual uses their accumulated skills, relative to an accepted standard, such as the necessary education or accumulated skills to perform a job. The subjective perspective, conversely, considers an individual's perceptions of their employment situation, specifically whether their inherent skills and abilities are being utilized in the work performed (Khan & Morrow, 1991). Objective and subjective dimensions of underemployment are illustrated in Appendix 1. The phenomenon of occupational mismatch is also distinguished as either vertical, horizontal, or in some cases both. Vertical mismatch refers to overeducation, specifically where an individual's education level exceeds the required education criteria of the individual's job. Horizontal mismatch, conversely, refers to cases where an individual's field of study is not aligned



5

with the individual's occupational field (Moore & Rosenbloom, 2016). Studies that investigate vertical mismatch in order to make inferences on underemployment focus specifically on educational attainment, using either an objective (e.g. job analysis) or subjective (e.g. selfassessment) measure. Horizontal mismatch studies, similarly, can be assessed using delineated classification schemes to form an objective measure, or by self-reporting measures which ask for respondents' perceptions of the relatedness between their field of study and job. 2.1.1 Objective Underemployment Feldman (1996) identifies five objective dimensions of underemployment: 1) possessing more education than is required in the job; 2) being in a job outside one's area of formal training; 3) possessing skills that are not utilized in the job; 4) being involuntarily employed in a part-time, temporary, or intermittent job; and 5) earning 20% less than in one's previous job or than one's peers. The underlying assumption to the objective perspective is that all individuals strive to avoid underemployment, and therefore it is not desirable in any situation for an individual or organization; the present study will adopt this involuntary perspective to underemployment in the present analysis. It should be noted that in some situations individuals may be deemed underemployed on some or all of the aforementioned dimensions, however, due to non-economic reasons. The career mobility hypothesis (discussed further in 2.2.2), for example, suggests that individuals may intentionally remain in a job which would otherwise be considered a skills mismatch, as a means of career progression towards higher-level jobs in the long-term. The present analysis proceeds based on an economic set of assumptions regarding underemployment to align with the objective perspective, while acknowledging the limitations of this assumption which excludes individuals' career choice and trajectory considerations.

Specific to investigating overeducation as it relates to underemployment, Verhaest and Omey (2006) summarize four common measures: direct self-assessment (DSA), indirect selfassessment (ISA), job analysis (JA), and realized matches (RM). Of these measures, realized matches and job analysis are objective. Job analysis is a systematic approach which uses an established classification scheme, such as Canada's National Occupational Classification (NOC), to delineate occupational requirements allowing for individual credentials to be matched with job requirements. Due to the explicit nature of such classification schemes, this approach has the benefit of offering clear definitions of education and corresponding occupational requirements (Hartog, 2000). Wolbers (2003), for example, uses a European classification scheme to investigate mismatch based on the relatedness of individuals' field of study and industry of work. The job analysis approach, however, may rely on classifications that are infrequently updated or potentially ambiguous, and therefore do not necessarily reflect market conditions; the limitations of this approach will be revisited in Chapter 6 of the analysis. The realized matches framework, outlined by Clogg and Shockey (1984), involves comparing the average education level within an occupation to job requirements. Occupational mismatch is assessed by comparing the most common years of education among individuals in the same occupation using the mean or mode; if, for example, an individual's education deviates significantly from this standard, the individual is deemed to be under or overeducated. A potential drawback to adopting the realized matches measure, however, is in how the results are interpreted, as observations are "based on the equilibrium realized by the interplay of supply and demand" (Hartog, 2000, p. 133). The realized matches approach, therefore, reflects the labour market conditions of a particular cohort by considering the average education credential requirements of the cohort, rather than the individual-level credentials within the cohort.

2.1.2 Subjective Underemployment Subjective measures, such as the direct self-assessment approach, often assess underemployment from a micro level, measuring the perceptions of respondents using a selfreporting measure. Empirical studies which adopt subjective measures claim such an approach provides richer interpretations of mismatch, due to the job-specific reference points, rather than broader occupational taxonomies (Wald, 2005). Furthermore, important job-related characteristics such as intelligence, interpersonal skills, critical thinking skills, or motivation are often left unmeasured in large scale datasets, unless otherwise self-reported by the respondent. Additionally, such measures are subject to potentially biased results due to respondents' tendency to over-report qualifications required to perform their job (Hartog, 2000). Hartog (2000) suggests the choice of measurement is largely based on data availability; in ideal circumstances where no data collection limitations are present, the job analysis measurement is preferred, as it relies on the assessment of job analyst professionals to define requirements and associated skill and education levels. The underlying assumption of such procedures is that underemployment acts "as a discrepancy concept, reflecting the difference between the educational requirements of the job and employee educational attainment" (Khan & Morrow, 1991, p. 212). Sicherman (1991) notes "overeducated workers are found to be younger... and also have higher rates of firm and occupational mobility" (p. 101); the levels of overeducation and occupational mobility are therefore relevant to further investigating underemployment, particularly among young people. 2.2 Theoretical Perspectives on Underemployment Four prominent theoretical perspectives in prior underemployment research include human capital theory (Becker, 1975), person-environment (P-E) and person-job (P-J) fit (Edwards, 1991), relative deprivation theory (Crosby, 1976), and the coping and control theory model of re-



8

employment (Latack, Kinicki, & Prussia, 1995). Human capital theory is used extensively by labour economists, and suggests that individuals make investments in themselves through obtaining education and training; employers then make hiring decisions based on an individual's acquired capital (Weiss, 1995). Relative deprivation theory is concerned with the subjective experience of underemployed workers, and research under this framework investigates underemployment based on the subjects' (e.g. employees') perceptions and beliefs that they desire better jobs than the one he/she currently holds (Crosby, 1976). The coping and control theory model of re-employment notes the importance of equilibrium in an individual's search for employment, which is met when an individual's skills are equal to the skills necessary to perform in a job. Displaced workers, it is argued, will not return to a state of equilibrium until the worker is re-employed in a job similar to the one the individual lost (McKee-Ryan et al., 2009). Within the theoretical approaches to underemployment, person-job (P-J) fit theory claims that "when there are differences between employees' abilities (measured through education, skills, experience) and the actual job requirements, there is a discrepancy or lack of fit" (McKee-Ryan & Harvey, 2011, p. 971). This discrepancy or `mismatch' can be determined on a number of dimensions, one of which is an individual's level of education, which has further implications for job outcomes, particularly turnover, discussed further in Section 2.3. 2.2.1 Person-Job Fit Model The perceived fit between individuals and the workplace has been contextualized in management and organizational behaviour literature using person-environment (P-E) fit as a theoretical framework, to determine "the degree of congruence or match between a person and environment" (Muchinsky & Monahan, 1987, p. 268). The theoretical literature on congruence is wide-ranging across disciplines, and includes an array of variations on P-E to assess fit at different



9

levels of analysis, including vocation (P-V), organization (P-O), coworker/group (P-G), and job (P-J) (Lauver & Kristof-Brown, 2001). In the context of overeducation, the most directly applicable variant from congruence theories is person-job fit, the narrowest level of analysis, which determines "the match between the abilities of a person and the demands of a job or the desires of a person and the attributes of a job" (Edwards, 1991, p. 284). The P-J fit model emphasizes congruence specifically between a person and job in order to predict individual and organizational outcomes (Edwards, 1991). This perspective is relevant to the present study as an individual's level of education may contribute to whether or not an employee is a `fit' for his/her job with respect to the knowledge and skill requirements specific to a particular job. "P-J fit is relevant to an individual's compatibility with a specific job, whereas P-O fit pertains to how an individual matches an organization's values, goals, and mission" (Lauver & Kristoff-Brown, 2001, p. 455). Kristof (1996) notes that fit may be a viable construct at many levels of analysis, as identified above. The level at which a researcher decides to examine fit is determined by the researcher's rationale for a particular model to be relevant. The present study will adopt P-J fit in order to determine congruence between education credentials obtained by individuals and the education requirements of occupations, in order to address the research question pertaining to overqualification levels, a phenomenon to be observed at the individual level. The demands-abilities perspective for the P-J fit model can be interpreted as follows: on the `demands' side, an employer asks, "what do I want of the employee?", while on the `abilities' side, an employee asks, "what am I expected to provide in order to keep this job?" (Caplan, 1987, p. 250). The employer sets a level of education required to perform the job, while the employee then offers a set of abilities to match these demands (Caldwell & O'Reilly, 1990). In some cases, however, a job seeker is hired for a job with education requirements below their abilities, which



10

constitutes underemployment for the purposes of this study. The P-J fit model considers the combined effects of the person and the job on outcomes, rather than assessing these variables in isolation. "The domain of P-J fit research is characterized by commensurate person and job constructs hypothesized to jointly influence various individual and organizational outcomes" (Edwards, 1991, p. 284). Distinct from P-O fit research, P-J fit should be determined relative to the tasks performed in a specific job, rather than the organization in which the job exists (Edwards, 1991). In this study, overqualification and tenure are explored at the individual level, in order to better explain the relationship between an individual's fit with their job and their likelihood of remaining in their job (see Appendix II). Maynard et al. (2006) claims the P-J fit model is well suited for the purpose of underemployment research, as each dimension of underemployment outlined by Feldman (1996), such as overeducation, can reflect a poor P-J fit. Based on the scope of this perspective, therefore, person-job fit is an appropriate framework to investigate congruence at the individual (job) level. 2.2.2 Matching Theory As illustrated in Appendix 1, overeducation represents one dimension of

underemployment, which is associated with several job and career-related outcomes. Specific to job-related outcomes at the individual level, prior literature which focuses on job search or intention to quit as an outcome have adopted one of three frameworks: matching theory (Jovanovic, 1979), differential overqualification theory (Frank, 1978), and the career mobility hypothesis (Sicherman, 1991). Matching theory claims that job search intentions lower with increasing job tenure, as the employee is more likely to be a `match' with their employer. This jobmatching approach to turnover makes three major assumptions: 1) productivity levels do not decline across different jobs, 2) employers and employees contract on an individual level (which



11

precludes the effect of collective agreements), and 3) imperfect information exists on the `optimal' assignment for individuals in the job market (Jovanovic, 1979). Contrary to this assumption of imperfect information, Frank (1978) and Sicherman (1991) claim overqualified workers can be hired for positions even where perfect information in the job market exists. The differential overqualification theory suggests the job search of married women is constrained geographically, and must compromise and accept employment, even if it is less than optimal, based on their accumulated human capital within the same labour market as their spouse, resulting in mismatch (Frank, 1978). Similar to the theory of differential overqualification which follows the assumption that mismatch can occur even with perfect information, the career mobility hypothesis claims some instances of mismatch are intentionally sought by individuals as a temporary means to obtain necessary work experience, in order to progress towards higher-level jobs (Sicherman, 1991). In the Canadian market, however, empirical evidence from Frenette (2004) finds stable overqualification rates two and five years following graduation, which does not corroborate the temporary stays of recent graduates implied by the career mobility hypothesis. Of these theoretical perspectives, matching theory has gained empirical support for investigating job search or intentions to quit as an outcome of underemployment, outlined by Feldman (1996). Using a self-reporting measure, Burke (1997) finds a significant relationship between underemployment levels and age among a sample of Canadian business school graduates; moreover, a significant relationship is reported between higher underemployment levels and negative work outcomes, such as intentions to quit. Allen and van der Velden (2001) distinguishes between educational and skill mismatches: mismatch based on education is determined by comparing an individual's level and field of education with the most appropriate level and field for the job; mismatch based on skill is determined by asking respondents whether their job allows



12

them to use their accumulated knowledge and skills. Self-reporting results found that while both measures had an effect, skills mismatch had a stronger influence on job search intentions (Allen & van der Velden, 2001). Holtom, Lee, and Tidd (2002) develop a measure of `work status congruence' which includes "employee preferences for full-time or part-time status, schedule, shift, and number of hours" (p. 903), and find a positive relationship between work status congruence and employee retention. Holtom et al. (2002) supports the use of underemployment measures as a method for predicting job-related outcomes, including voluntary turnover. 2.3 Consequences of Underemployment Underemployment has been associated with job, career, and personal-related outcomes at the individual level (Erdogan, Baur, Peiró, & Truxillo, 2011). Previous management literature which use overeducation as a measure, for example, suggest that employees deemed to be overqualified tend to exhibit negative job attitudes (Johnson & Johnson, 1996; Maynard et al., 2006). Wald (2005) finds a strong relationship between overqualified workers and job search intentions. The study adopts the economic assumption that individuals make job search decisions based on a cost-benefit analysis; overqualification, under this assumption, represents a less than ideal state from the employee's perspective, akin to matching theory (Jovanovic, 1979). Using a subjective measure of fit based on respondents' perceptions of mismatch which considers accumulated experience, education, and training, Wald (2005) also notes the presence of several employee perceptions, such as perceived satisfaction and fairness, which lowered job search intentions. Maynard, Joseph, and Maynard (2006) develop a `scale of perceived overqualification', and find a positive relationship between employee perceptions of being overqualified and turnover intentions. The results concur with the P-J fit model, where "negative outcomes are only predicted



13

when there is a mismatch between the needs of the employee and the characteristics of the position" (Maynard et al., 2006, p. 530). Consequences have also been associated with career-related effects for overqualified individuals. Verdugo and Verdugo (1989), for example, implement a realized matches measure to investigate the effect of overeducation on wages, and find lower wages among the overeducated, compared to those deemed under or adequately-qualified. Robst (2007) observed the effects of horizontal mismatch on wages, and suggests individuals working in an occupational industry that is not aligned with their field of study are more likely to earn lower wages than horizontal match counterparts. Tsai (2010), uses a similar measure similar to Verdugo and Verdugo (1989) based on U.S. Census occupation codes and corroborates the notion that the positive relationship observed between earnings and education does not have the same effect on those deemed to be overeducated, contrary to the human capital perspective (Becker, 1975). With regards to personal outcomes, Khan and Morrow (1991) find subjective underemployment to be the result of poor person-job fit, and claim a poor match cannot be changed by solely matching higher-educated individuals in jobs which require higher educational attainment (objective fit), but is more explained by the subjective factors of underemployment. The prevalence of subjective factors is evidenced by empirical studies investigating subjective, personal outcomes (see Appendix 1). Burris (1983), for example, used subjective perceptions of overqualification through self-reported results on psychological well-being, and finds a positive relationship between perceived mismatch and feelings of personal dissatisfaction. Johnson and Johnson (1996) find similar results for the effect of perceived overqualification on psychological well-being, one of the outcomes of underemployment identified by Feldman (1996).

2.4 Voluntary Turnover and Underemployment Turnover is a widely researched topic in organizational behaviour literature, which encompasses both voluntary (employee-initiated) and involuntary (employer-initiated) turnover. Specific to voluntary turnover, one of the following three attitudinal constructs or antecedents are commonly observed: job satisfaction (Porter & Steers; 1973; Mobley, 1977), perceived alternatives (Muchinsky & Morrow, 1980), and job embeddedness (Mitchell & Lee, 2001). A guiding principle in turnover research has been the notion that turnover is "a function of negative job attitudes combined with an ability to secure employment elsewhere" (Steers & Mowday, 1981, p. 237). In an early study on turnover, March and Simon (1958) refer to an `equilibrium', in which individuals remain in an organization where inducements (such as wages) either match or exceed the individual's contributions or effort expended on-the-job. Subsequent research has adopted job satisfaction and job alternatives as concepts for investigating turnover. For the purpose of this study, voluntary turnover refers to an individual voluntarily deciding to terminate employment from an organization (Mobley, 1977). Not captured in the present study are employee intentions (to stay or quit) nor employee withdrawal. Since individuals' perceptions are beyond the scope of the present study, this review will provide a theoretical background relevant for addressing the concept of voluntary turnover as it relates to congruence or `fit' between individuals and job requirements. 2.4.1 Turnover-Satisfaction Relationship The most frequently referenced determinant in turnover research is job satisfaction. An early study from Porter and Steers (1973) finds a consistent and inverse relationship between job satisfaction and turnover, using organization-wide, immediate work environment, job-related, and personal factors for analysis. The results are aggregated and presented as the Met Expectations



15

Model, which claims that "organizational, work, and personal factors can be associated with the decision to withdraw" (Porter and Steers, 1973, p. 167). In this conceptual model, satisfaction is not caused by a specific level of pay or opportunity, but rather the extent to which pay and opportunity meet an individual's expectations. Following this model, therefore, voluntary turnover is less likely when an individual's prior expectations are met on the job. Price (1975) supports the inclusion of economic indicators, and notes the net balance of benefits over costs involved with a change in employment for individuals as a moderating variable in estimating the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover. Continuing the logic of Porter and Steers (1973) in which `intention to leave' follows job dissatisfaction, Mobley (1977) extends the concept of intention to leave as the last step of a withdrawal process that concludes with voluntary turnover. Job dissatisfaction and an individual's turnover decision bookend this multi-stage process, in which the individual considers potential mediating variables prior to a decision to terminate employment; for example, individuals evaluate several aspects of their circumstances: his/her existing job, the expected utility of searching for new employment; and the available alternatives in the labour market, compared to their current employment situation (Mobley, 1977). 2.4.2 Turnover-Alternatives Relationship Muchinsky and Morrow (1980) present a multidisciplinary model of turnover, with the intention of gathering psychological and economic factors determined in previous research. The model adopts three main determinants of turnover empirically tested in prior literature: individual, work-related, and economic opportunity factors, which consists of: 1) the state of the labour market, 2) the sector of activity, and 3) the geographical location of the organization (Muchinsky & Morrow, 1980). This model suggests, therefore, that the opportunity to find work (as evidenced by employment rates, for example) serve as an antecedent of voluntary turnover. The work-related



16

determinant includes person-job congruence as a variable in predicting turnover (Muchinsky & Morrow, 1980). In addition to determinants, the model also looks to further understand the potential consequences of turnover, explored previously by Price (1975). Four classes of consequences regarding turnover are outlined: individual, organizational-social, organizationaleconomic, and societal (Muchinsky & Morrow, 1980). These consequences contextualize the implications of the present study; voluntary turnover presents implications for the individual (job holders), organization (job creators), and society (job seekers) are met with sociological and economic consequences. 2.4.3 Job Embeddedness In contrast to the Mobley (1977) model of turnover which outlines a rational decision making path for individuals, Mitchell and Lee (2001) expand upon the constructs used to understand voluntary turnover and retention by identifying a new construct, job embeddedness, of which there are three dimensions: links, which refers to "the formal or informal connections an individual has with other individuals or groups either on or off-the-job"; fit, which refers to "an individual's compatibility with their work and non-work settings"; and sacrifice, which refers to "the perceived loss of material or psychological benefits that currently are available or will be available in the future" (p. 216 ­ 219). Based on these dimensions, various on-and-off-the-job forces form an aggregate construct to interpret voluntary turnover (Mitchell & Lee, 2001). Of interest to this study is the fit dimension, which resembles the person-organization and person-job fit theoretical framework discussed earlier. Mitchell and Lee (2001) conjecture, much like the person-environment literature, that the better the fit between an individual and their work, the less likely the individual is to leave the organization. Job embeddedness distinguishes, however, a need to assess on-and-off-the-job factors (rather than solely matching individuals' skills with a job) to



17

further understand the dynamic between fit and retention. The job embeddedness model presents three considerations to future turnover research: first, individuals leave jobs in different ways; second, the process of staying is different from the process of leaving; and third, the decision to stay is associated with a sense of `embeddedness' with the job (Mitchell & Lee, 2001). In summary, individuals can become `stuck' or embedded in their jobs due to organizational (on-thejob) and community (off-the-job)-related forces. Job embeddedness may therefore moderate the relationship between overqualification and turnover in that overqualified individuals may elect to remain in their current position for various reasons if and when a more suitable job for their level of education is available. One of the observed factors of job embeddedness includes job tenure, suggesting that an individual's duration of employment in itself can affect one's `embeddedness' within an organization. Length of service is a common measure of turnover; in Price's (1975) codification of turnover measures, for example, `average length of service' is the first of four possible measures. Mobley, Horner, and Hollingsworth (1978), similarly, use tenure as a variable to compare with intention to quit and actual turnover. Person-job fit, as discussed above, is an important measure for retention. Kristoff (1996), for example, finds that perceptions of `mis-fit' increases instances of voluntary turnover. The present study proceeds with tenure as a measurement of turnover; however, the analysis does not observe the differences between voluntary and involuntary forms of turnover, as the Labour Force Survey (LFS) datasets do not capture this distinction. While job satisfaction and organizational commitment measures are beyond the scope of this study, elements of job embeddedness provide theoretical backing for the connection between skill requirements and tenure: this study hypothesizes lower tenure rates will be observed where a poor fit exists.

2.5 Overqualification Levels among Postsecondary Graduates Several empirical studies have investigated the labour market outcomes of Canadian graduates and underemployment levels. Vahey (2000) claims the returns to post-secondary education in Canada have varied due to two factors: required education levels and gender. Using Statistics Canada's National Survey of Class Structure and Labour Process (NSCS), evidence from the 1982 cohort suggests over-education to be more prevalent than under-educated graduates; specifically, 30% of males and 32% of females self-reported as being over-educated, compared to those who self-reported as being under-educated, at 24% and 17% respectively (Vahey, 2000). While this study involves job-specific self-reporting, limited inferences can be made due to the subjective nature of the measure, which is prone to bias. Individuals may, for example, overstate their responses in a way that does not accurately reflect his/her labour market circumstances, relative to their cohort. Frenette (2004) investigates returns to post-secondary education, particularly the role field of study has on the incidence and persistence of overqualification among Canadian graduates. The study pools three cohorts (1982, 1986, and 1990) and finds that more than 30% of graduates were overqualified for his/her current job (Frenette, 2004). While overqualification trended downward over the three cohorts sampled, Frenette (2004) notes a persistence of overqualification from two to five years following graduation, as only 25% of overqualified graduates in the initial survey were no longer considered overqualified in the subsequent survey. Overqualification was found to fluctuate based on field of study; for example, graduates of fine arts, humanities, social sciences, and agricultural and biological sciences are the most likely to be overqualified, compared to graduates of education, engineering, computer science, law, and medicine fields at the bachelor's level of study (Frenette, 2004). Finnie (2000) reports similar findings, and notes the increase in



19

temporary work among graduates, which illustrates a change in labour market conditions away from permanent jobs. Walters (2004) compares both earnings and employment levels as a measure of labour market outcomes for postsecondary education. Using four cohorts of the NGS (1982, 1986, 1990, and 1995), Walters (2004) argues that the labour market experiences of postsecondary education graduates have remained relatively stable across credential levels. "Graduates of university undergraduate programs generally have a higher probability of being employed full time than do graduates of college programs, who, in turn, have a greater probability of being employed full time than do graduates of trades programs" (Walters, 2004, p. 15). The probability of university graduates having full time employment declined steadily over the four cohorts analyzed, from approximately 85 to 80% (Walters, 2004); this result could be influenced by the study analyzing only one set of responses, 2 years following graduation, and not including the responses from the same cohort 5 years following graduation. In terms of earnings, the results corroborate the commonly held concept that higher levels of education equate to higher earnings (Becker, 1975). Drewes (2010) also identifies a skills mismatch, in which the "pattern of enrolments does not match the pattern of skill needs in the labour market" (p. 2). In order to assess the level of fit between postsecondary education and labour market needs, Drewes (2010) uses data from the National Graduates Survey (NGS), supplemented with 2006 Canada Census data to determine the presence of overqualification as a symptom of over-supply among graduates. The study utilizes a self-reported measure of the NGS, in which respondents indicate themselves as being overqualified for their jobs, based on their level of education, experience, and training. The selfreported levels of overqualification among five cohorts of graduates do not demonstrate an upward trend in overqualification; additionally, male bachelor's respondents are least likely and male



20

college respondents are most likely to report themselves as overqualified (Drewes, 2010). Drewes (2010) claims that despite the growth in supply of Ontario graduates, there is no evidence of overeducation among Ontario's young labour force. Fenesi and Sana (2015) use the most recent NGS cohort of 2005 and find that an individual's field of study offers a unique set of knowledge and skills, some of which are less marketable in the workplace. Similar to the results of Frenette (2004), Fenesi and Sana (2015) also report differences based on field of study; humanities graduates, in particular, were more likely to be unemployed at 35%, compared to all other programs surveyed at under 17% (Fenesi & Sana, 2015). In terms of overqualification rates, "the odds of being overqualified decreased by 50% for education, 38% for science, and 65% for math and computer science" (Fenesi & Sana, 2015, p. 391). These findings corroborate the notion that employers are increasingly shifting towards job seekers that offer technical skills that are closely related to the discipline, rather than fields of study such as humanities, which produce more general skills that are "more likely to produce unrelated, overqualified employment" (Fenesi & Sana, 2015, p. 394). When observing an earlier cohort from 1993 to 2001, Moore and Rosenbloom (2016) estimate the skill levels of workers with a university education, and found an increase in overqualification between 1993 and 2001. The study examined those with a `strong attachment' to the labour market, defined as those individuals who worked for 4.5 of the 6 years observed, and a minimum tenure of one month in a position that required a high school education; within this group, approximately 30% of the sample held a position that required at most a high school diploma, despite having a university degree (Moore & Rosenbloom, 2016). However, Moore and Rosenbloom (2016) also note higher education levels were associated with less overqualification, as only one in five workers with a bachelor's degree or higher experienced overqualification. No significant finding was reached regarding mismatch between men or women, with



21

overqualification rates at around 31% and 26% respectively (Moore & Rosenbloom, 2016). Frank et al. (2015) found inconclusive results to support a mismatch between education and employment. When viewed holistically, the labour market outcomes of young graduates have not decreased substantially, with some exceptions based on gender. Full-year, full-time employment among male bachelor's degree holders, for example, decreased from 2005 to 2010, but this decrease was not experienced by the female cohort during the same time period (Frank et. al, 2015). 2.5.1 Non-Standard Employment Relevant to studies of overqualification are job-specific indicators such as permanent or temporary job status. In some instances, a worker's job status can be deemed precarious, which refers to a form of non-standard work which differs from the a more traditional standard of employment, characterized by a worker having "one employer; employed full-year, full time on the employer's premises; enjoys extensive statutory benefits and entitlements; and expects to be employed indefinitely" (Vosko, Zukewich, & Cranford, 2003, p. 16). The present study adopts the broad definition by Krahn (1995) which defines non-standard work as individuals engaged in temporary employment (which includes term or contract, seasonal, casual, temporary agency, and all other jobs with a specific pre-determined end date); all responses in the Labour Force Survey (LFS) of such forms of employment are collapsed into one `temporary' job status category. Workers engaged in non-standard work can be the result of voluntary or involuntary reasons. For example, workers may take on part-time or temporary work, despite preferring more traditional employment, due to poor business conditions or a lack of permanent employment opportunities. Conversely, workers may elect to take on part-time work to satisfy needs beyond the workplace, such as pursuing higher education or family obligations (Vosko, Zukewich, & Cranford, 2003).



22

In Canada, a trend of casualization has been observed, whereby the labour force has experienced growth in the proportion of individuals engaged in casual work arrangements. Empirical findings based on the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reveal a decrease in the proportion of employees with full-time, permanent work, from 67% in 1989 to 63% in 2002 (Vosko, Zukewich, & Cranford, 2003). Young workers, in particular, face precarious employment situations more than those in the later stages of their careers. The share of young workers ages 15 to 24 with fulltime permanent employment decreased by 18 and 13 percentage points for females and males respectively from 1989 to 2002 (Vosko, Zukewich, & Cranford, 2003). These trends have implications for the outcomes of more recent graduates in Canada. Based on the 2006 Census and 2011 National Household Survey (NHS), the proportion of young workers ages 25 to 34 engaged in full-year, full-time employment has slightly decreased overall in 2010, relative to 2005, particularly for those with a high school diploma as his/her highest level of education attained (Frank, Frenette, & Morisette, 2015). These employment patterns indicate a skills mismatch is more likely for young workers, given the decreasing proportion of permanent, full-time employment opportunities in addition to the increasing supply of higher education graduates.

Chapter 3: Methodology 3.1 Research Question In this study, the primary research question asks: what is the relationship between jobeducation match and job tenure levels among young Canadians, 25 to 34 years of age? Investigating the match between education credentials and job requirements in Canada can inform employers of the need to implement adequate succession planning or increased training and development to retain talent in the event of overqualified or underqualified employees



23

respectively. Moreover, such findings can address the need for implementing targeted HR policies and practices for particular age cohorts in the workplace. Such findings are also of interest to young Canadians, considering future higher education and/or job market decisions. A set of supporting questions will also be explored, including: 1) what is the effect of job-education match on the tenure rates of the remaining working population, 35 to 64 years of age, relative to young workers? and 2) has the relationship between job-education match and tenure changed for the respective age groups across time? To address these research objectives, this study will investigate tenure and education credentials 1) across time, comparing the 1997 and 2014 LFS datasets, and 2) between age cohorts, by using two age cohorts of 25 to 34 and 35 to 65 year olds to represent young workers, relative to the remainder of the working population. 3.1.1 Hypotheses Hypothesis 1a: a negative relationship exists between overqualification (relative to jobeducation match) and tenure (in months) for young Canadians, ages 25 to 34. Hypothesis 1b: a positive relationship exists between underqualification (relative to jobeducation match) and tenure (in months) for young Canadians, ages 25 to 34. The null hypothesis (H0) assumes there is no significant relationship between job-education match and tenure, and vice versa with the alternative hypothesis (H1). A negative relationship is predicted between overqualification and tenure; specifically, young Canadians with higher education credentials than what is required for his/her occupational category will report lower tenure, or length of service in months in his/her primary job. Conversely, young Canadians with lower than required educational credentials will experience higher rates of tenure (relative to those with a job matching their education). This hypothesis is based on Canadian trends in employment across age groups. The full-time employment rate among young Canadians aged 25 to 29 years



24

with a university education has declined from 1976 to 2014, particularly among men by approximately 10 percentage points, according to Labour Force Survey results (Morisette, Hou, & Schellenberg, 2015). This can be attributed to rising levels of temporary (part-time and/or casual) employment, which is a traditionally a more precarious employment relationship than full-time, and therefore more challenging to sustain longer job tenure levels. Additionally, this study acknowledges that young Canadians, in particular, may use such precarious work as a bridge to sustaining higher quality employment, especially if high levels of education allow for such mobility (Heisz, 1999). Hypothesis 2a: Young Canadians, ages 25 to 34, who are overqualified (relative to jobeducation match) will have shorter tenures (in months) than those ages 35 to 64 who are overqualified. Hypothesis 2b: Young Canadians, ages 25 to 34, who are underqualified will have longer tenures than those ages 35 to 64 who are overqualified. Hypothesis 2 predicts young workers will exhibit a shorter relationship to tenure than the remaining working population, whereas workers who are underqualified will exhibit a longer relationship to tenure, which will be observed from the results of the pooled 1997 and 2014 model. Labour force survey results indicate participation rates among Canadians 55 years and over has increased since 1996, from approximately 24% to 38% in 2016 (Fields, Uppal, & LaRochelleCôté, 2017). Due to rising participation rates among older workers in Canada over time, there is consequently more opportunity for older workers captured in the present study to accrue job tenure, considering participation rates among young workers has declined due to increased school stays (Fields, Uppal, & LaRochelle-Côté, 2017). In addition, older workers have more time to invest in



25

educational attainment, and more opportunity to gain experience by nature of longer time spent in the labour market. Hypothesis 3a: All overqualified respondents, ages 25 to 64, will have shorter tenures in the 2014 survey, compared to the 1997 survey. Hypothesis 3b: All underqualified respondents, ages 25 to 64, will have longer tenures in the 2014 survey, compared to the 1997 survey. Hypothesis 3 predicts workers of all ages in the 2014 sample will exhibit a stronger relationship to tenure than those in the 1997 sample, which will be observed from the results of the pooled 1997 and 2014 model. This hypothesis reflects the changing nature of the labour market in Canada; the rise of increasing global competition, technological change, and other economic influences have created a more competitive job market, which means that, overall, workers are more likely to have shorter-term employment in recent years, compared to the 1997 cohort due to the changing nature of work (Morisette, Hou, & Schellenberg, 2015). 3.2 Data & Methods Based on existing theoretical frameworks utilized in the underemployment research, the present study adopts the person-job (P-J) fit model (see Appendix 2) as a theoretical perspective to investigate the relationship between job-education match and tenure levels among young Canadians, relative to the remaining working population. From the wide scope of literature pertaining to the fit between employees and their work, P-J fit narrows the scope to the individual level, which allows for a better understanding of the match between an individual's skills and the requirements of a job (Edwards, 1991). The P-J fit model suggests that a discrepancy between employees and their job can be understood by comparing the education, skills, or experience of an individual with the demands of a job (McKee-Ryan & Harvey, 2011). Overeducation, one of the



26

dimensions of underemployment outlined by Feldman (1996), is used as a measure of individual mismatch outcomes. This study also adopts the job analysis (JA) approach (Hartog, 2000) to objectively measure underemployment using the National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2011 as a reference for occupational categories and corresponding education levels to measure overeducation. The NOC 2011 was created by Statistics Canada and Human Resources and Skills Development Canada as an update to integrate the formerly distinct NOC-S (Statistics Canada) and NOC (HRSDC) coding systems into a unified version. This taxonomy provides a Canadawide framework for organizing occupations into broad categories, based on the type of work performed, and by the occupations' tasks, duties, and responsibilities (Statistics Canada, 2012). This study uses archival data from the 1997 and 2014 master files of the Labour Force Survey (LFS), conducted monthly by Statistics Canada. The questionnaire for the LFS includes relevant data regarding individuals' highest level of education and labour force information, such as occupation and industry (Statistics Canada, 2016). Coverage of the LFS excludes: "persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces, full-time members of the Canadian Armed Forces, the institutionalized population, and households in extremely remote areas with very low population density", which represents approximately 2% of the working population aged 15 and over (Statistics Canada, p. 20). The sample design strata divide the population based on Census (2011) data and the National Household Survey (2011). While the LFS does include respondents from all provinces and territories, the sampling framework used in the territories is different from that used in the provinces; as such, the present study includes cases only from provinces (Statistics Canada, 2016). The LFS forms a sample using a rotating panel of households, which opens the potential for respondents to be included in the panel for up to six months at a time. To address possible overlap in survey data, the present analysis uses cases from



27

January and July. The non-response rate of selected households averages at 10%, while reaching approximately 56,000 households monthly (Statistics Canada, 2016), which allows for a representative sample of the intended working population. As noted in the review of the underemployment literature, one of the challenges in implementing either objective or subjective measures is access to appropriate data. While the National Graduate Survey (NGS) is a popular dataset for research pertaining to Canadian graduates' activity, the NGS is currently inactive and the most recent survey data (2010) would not be representative of the current working population. For this reason, the LFS has been selected based on its sample size, cross-sectional scope and necessary variables: education level and occupation. Due to the limitations of the LFS questionnaire, a self-assessment measure is not feasible since respondents are not asked of their perceptions regarding work and education. Clogg and Shockey (1984) suggest a measure of mismatch is useful when it is "comprehensive, or applicable to broad categories of workers", and "able to deal with fluctuations in labour force behaviour over time" (p. 239). To reflect these considerations, the present study utilizes the NOC's broad classification scheme, and investigates two distinct points in time, 1997 and 2014, using the job analysis approach. 3.2 Research Design For the purposes of this study, `young workers' are represented by individuals 25 to 34 years of age, consistent with the age cohort established by Statistics Canada in demographic results within its economic reports. This distinction of age range also allows for the completion of at least a four-year degree and a few years of transition from school to work. For the purposes of comparison, individuals aged 35 to 64 are used as a benchmark, to represent the remaining group of individuals in the labour force up to age of 64, a commonly used upper limit of the working



28

population prior to the Canadian retirement age. Omitted from the sample are current students (full or part-time status) and unemployed individuals, to best reflect the intended demographic of young Canadians fully engaged in the workplace. Any remaining cases in the LFS based on the above sample restrictions which contain missing values for any of the variables used in the analysis (detailed in 3.3.2) are removed; as a result, 35,305 cases are omitted from the sample. As noted, to account for the rotating panels of the LFS, the sample is restricted to responses obtained in the months of January and July from each LFS file, to ensure each case is unique. Edwards (1991) notes "more accurate estimates will be obtained by employing large samples drawn from a variety of jobs, occupations, and industries" (Edwards, 1991, p. 329). While most studies in P-J fit rely on small samples of 200 or under within a single job (Edwards, 1991), an advantage of the present study is the large sample of LFS survey respondents aged 25 to 34 across all education levels and occupational categories, in order to assess the trends in job-education match levels between age groups and across time. Based on these restrictions, the study will use a working sample of 160,737 total respondents between the 1997 and 2014 LFS files.1 In previous congruence literature, a common methodology for assessing fit is the reduction of person and job measures into a single index to identify the level of similarity between them (Edwards, 1991). As per the job analysis method, the present evaluation based on the level of education credentials in occupations is conducted using the National Occupational Classification, the nationally accepted taxonomy of occupations in Canada, developed by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) and Statistics Canada. The 2011 version of the NOC is used for consistency with existing codes found in the LFS. The NOC is organized in a four-level hierarchy,

All figures hereafter are presented in weighted figures to meet the output requirements of the Canadian Research Data Centre Network.  29

1

which includes 40,000 occupations categorized under 10 broad occupational categories, 40 major groups, and 140 minor groups, and 500 unit groups. The categories and titles of this taxonomy, while not exhaustive, are used to cover the most commonly understood occupation titles in the Canadian labour market. The NOC contains detailed information compiled by job analysts regarding the main duties and employment requirements commonly found in each occupational category. Occupations may fluctuate in the type or level of requirements, however, and therefore each individual title includes a range of acceptable education requirements. Occupations with employment requirements listed as `required' indicate a consistent requirement from employers, but may also include additional employment requirements listed as `usually' or `may be' required, which are used to describe qualifications not common across all employers. To address these ranges, this study adopts the NOC 2011 skill matrix as a way of organizing each occupation into a set of defined skill levels, which provide a range of education credentials to reflect "the most commonly accepted educational, training, or preparatory routes for entering employment" (Statistics Canada, 2012, p. 13). All occupations are then coded with an associated skill level, denoted by the second digit of the 4-digit NOC code. One exception to Table 1 is the sorting of all management occupations (NOC codes beginning with 00 to 09), which are all labeled as skill level A. 3.2.1 Job-Education Match Variable The education requirements identified in the NOC skill matrix are matched with the Table 1: NOC Skill Variable Codes NOC Skill Matrix Skill Level A Skill Level B Skill Level C Skill Level D NOC Code NOC 2nd digit 0 or 1 NOC 2nd digit 2 or 3 NOC 2nd digit 4 or 5 NOC 2nd digit 6 or 7 response categories of the LFS to fit the four skill levels, illustrated in Table 2. A new set of dummy variables for job-education match are created to categorize all workers in the



30

sample as one of the following: match, underqualified, or overqualified. An individual is deemed a match where his/her education level is equal to the employment requirements of the NOC skill matrix; underqualified where his/her education level is less than the employment requirements of the NOC skill matrix; and overqualified where his/her education level is more than the employment requirements of the NOC skill matrix (Frenette, 2004). Scurry and Blenkinsopp (2011) identify three approaches to measuring underemployment, one of which is "the educational requirements of an occupation" (p. 647) which supports the match measurement in this study. Table 2: NOC 2011 Skill Level Matrix Criteria NOC Skill Educational Requirement (NOC) Level Matrix Skill Level A · University degree (Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctorate) Skill Level B · Community college, institute of technology or CEGEP · Apprenticeship training Skill Level C Skill Level D · · · High school diploma Some secondary school education No formal educational requirements

Education Credentials (LFS) 9 = Above Bachelor's degree 8 = Bachelor's degree 7 = University certificate below Bachelor's 6 = Community college, CEGEP, etc. 5 = Trades certificate or diploma 4 = Some post-secondary education 3 = Grade 11-13, graduate 2 = Grade 11-13, non-graduate 1 = Grade 9-10 0 = Grade 8 or lower

To illustrate this coding process, a sample occupation, Retail Salesperson, is coded as 6421 in the NOC 2011. This occupation falls under Skill Level C in the NOC skill matrix, which is associated with education credentials within the range of `Grade 11 to 13, graduate' to `some postsecondary education'. If, for example, an individual's highest education in the LFS is coded as 8 for a Bachelor's degree, then the individual would be deemed overqualified (since the NOC Skill Level was less than the individual's highest education credential). Similarly, if the same



31

individual's education was coded as 1 in the LFS for `Grade 9 to 10', the individual would be deemed underqualified (since the NOC skill level exceeds individual's highest education level). 3.3 Procedure The analysis involves estimating a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions using the natural log of tenure, measured for individuals' primary job as the outcome variable. Models are estimated separately for young workers (25 to 34 years of age) and the remaining working sample (35 to 64 years of age) for the years 1997 and 2014, in order to observe the difference in the relationship between job-education match and tenure for young versus older workers as well as across time. The distribution of tenure is weighted and binned into a percentage scale in the histograms to comply with weighted output procedures from Statistics Canada's Research Data Centre (RDC). Based on the initial histogram of the tenure variable (Charts 1a and 1b), the data is left-skewed, as the majority of cases have relatively short tenures (measured in months). A log transformation of the tenure variable is used to pull outlying data closer to the bulk of the data to follow an approximately normal frequency distribution (Charts 2a and 2b), and to correct potential violations of the parametric assumptions associated with conducting an OLS regression (Winer, 1962).

The key independent variable in the model is whether or not a respondent's education level matches his/her job as outlined above. As described above, two possible dummy variables are included, one denoting an overqualified respondent (i.e. where education credentials from LFS > NOC requirements for the job) and a second if the respondent is underqualified (i.e. education credentials from LFS < NOC requirements for the job) with job-education match (i.e. education credentials from LFS = NOC requirements for the job) as the omitted reference.

3.3.1 Control Variables A number of control variables are included based on similar empirical research: age (Vahey, 2000; Walters, 2004; Drewes, 2010; Frank & Walters, 2012; Fenesi & Sana, 2015), gender (Vahey, 2000; Walters, 2004; Drewes, 2010), province (Vahey, 2000; Frenette, 2004; Walters, 2004), highest level of education attained (Vahey, 2000; Frenette, 2004; Drewes, 2010; Frank & Walters, 2012), public or private status (Vahey, 2000), permanent or temporary job status (Finnie, 2000; Fenesi & Sana, 2015), union status (Vahey, 2000), and occupational classification (Vahey, 2000; Frenette, 2004). Prior empirical research interpreting overqualification has also accounted for work experience (Frenette, 2004). In order to account for the effect of relevant work experience in the model, age squared is included as a proxy, since such information is not available in the LFS. The older an individual, the more years of work experience can likely be accumulated. Since age is highly correlated with work experience, age squared is commonly used where survey data does not have available information on work experience (Luong & Hébert, 2009). Key control variables include those for whether or not an individual is covered by a collective agreement (union member) and if the respondent works in a public or private sector organization (class of worker). These variables are noteworthy in that they may capture some reasons why individuals may remain in a job that does not match their current level of education if public sector and/or unionized employment provide security or additional benefits not found in private and/or non-union employment. Empirical evidence from Freeman (1980), for example, suggests that job tenure increases where workers are unionized; such reductions in exits are argued to be the result of the grievance procedures and improvements in wages and working conditions of unionized environments. Green and Riddell (1997) found a `hollowing out' of medium-term jobs in Canada, due to increases in short-term and long-term in-progress jobs from 1979 to 1991.



34

Heisz (2005) also found a polarization of job tenure, characterized by increases in `short jobs' and `long jobs'; based on LFS data, estimated retention rates were lowest for the youngest workers of the sample, and retention rates increased as young workers aged up to 55 years, at which point retention rates decreased. Heisz (2005) notes this reflects the labour market experience of young workers, who "have more opportunities to find a good job match and more time to accumulate tenure" (p. 13). Retention rates also saw slight decreases over time for the 15 to 24 age group, which might be attributed to the trend of increasing school participation rates among young people. In the same period of time, retention rates increased with educational attainment. To avoid the potentially confounding effects of school attendance and labour force attachment, the sample is restricted to exclude current students and defines young workers at age 25 and up. While Healy, Lehman, and McDaniel (1995) found a weak relationship between age and voluntary turnover, Ng and Feldman (2009) find a moderately strong relationship between age and turnover, and calls for further research which investigates "who is more likely to voluntarily leave their organizations, not only among older workers but among younger workers as well" (Ng & Feldman, 2009, p. 290). Based on these findings, the age-turnover relationship is investigated by measuring tenure patterns for each age group to make inferences on voluntary turnover. 3.3.2 Interaction Terms In order to test whether the relationship between job-education match and tenure is different for young versus older workers as well as across time, a pooled OLS regression is estimated using log tenure as the dependent variable. The pooled model includes both age groups and both years of survey data, with dummy variables denoting the 2014 survey year and whether the respondent falls within the 25 to 34 age cohort. In addition to the key independent variables for job-education match and control variables described above, the pooled model includes



35

interaction terms, which allow for statistically testing the differences in job-education match between age cohorts and over time, controlling for other observable characteristics. Specifically, the following 8 interaction terms are formed: Figure 1: Interaction Terms 1) overyoung = overqualified * youngworkers; 2) underyoung = underqualified * youngworkers; 3) over2014 = underqualified * surveyyear2014; 4) under2014 = underqualified * surveyyear2014; 5) youngtime = youngworkers * surveyyear2014; 6) over3way = overqualified * surveyyear2014 * youngworkers; and 7) under3way = underqualified * surveyyear2014 * youngworkers. The interactions between age cohort and job-education match (1 and 2) test for a difference in the relationship between turnover and mismatch between age cohorts (i.e. whether turnover is different for young workers, relative to older workers). The interaction between the 2014 survey year and mismatch (3 and 4) tests whether rates of overqualification have changed between 1997 and 2014 for the entire sample of workers. The interaction between age cohort and time (5) tests whether turnover rates have changed for young workers from 1997 to 2014. And finally the three-way interactions between mismatch, time, and age cohort (6 and 7) tests whether the rates of turnover are different for young workers over time, relative to older workers over time. Figure 2 illustrates the equations for each model of the analysis where each of the variables (with the exception of age and age squared, which is continuous, and over/underqualified) contains a set of dummy variables related to that category. For the purposes of interpretation, the category of these variables are listed, rather than the complete set of dummy variables contained in the model.

Chapter 4: Results 4.1 Descriptive Statistics Weighted frequency tables are provided in Appendix 4 of the variables used for analysis in each model. Bootstraps have recently been added to the LFS files, however, these are not used in the present analysis. Final survey sampling weights are rescaled to reflect the change from 12 to 2 survey months of data. As such, caution should be used when interpreting standard errors in the models. From the sample restrictions outlined in the Data & Methods section, the frequency results from the pooled model indicate the sample is comprised mostly of private sector workers (74.2%), individuals not bound by a collective agreement (64.4%), and individuals employed with a permanent job status (91.4%). The highest proportion of respondents are categorized as having a community college diploma (22.3%), a high school diploma (19.9%), or a Bachelor's degree (17.7%) as his/her highest level of education attained at the time of the survey. The sample is also in line with the trend of increasing post-secondary education graduates in Canada (Office of the



37

Parliamentary Budget Office, 2015); Bachelor's degree holders, for example, represented 25.3% of the sample of young workers in 2014, compared to 17.0% in the 1997 sample. The proportion of high school diploma holders among the young worker sample is less in 2014 than the 1997 survey, which corroborates prior evidence of longer school stays in Canada (Fields, Uppal, & LaRochelle-Côté, 2017). Observing the sample frequencies by age cohort, the 25 to 34 group are mainly private employees, with a slight decrease in proportion between survey years, from 81.2% to 78.8%. Similarly, the proportion of young workers with permanent employment is lower in 2014 at 90.4%, relative to the 1997 sample at 88.3%. Young workers with non-union membership is relatively equal across survey years, at approximately 70% of the sample in both 1997 and 2014. For the 35 to 64 age cohort, the proportion of private employees remains relatively similar, with 70.5% and 72.5% of respondents in the 1997 and 2014 surveys respectively. Similar to the sample of young workers, the proportion of older workers with a permanent job status declined slightly between the 1997 and 2014 samples, from 93% to 91.9%. Union status shows a more pronounced decline in its proportion of older workers in the 2014 sample at 33.2%, relative to the 1997 sample, 39.3%. Across age cohorts, frequency tables indicate the following for both 1997 and 2014 samples: 1) the proportion of private sector status respondents is comprised of more young workers; 2) the proportion of permanent job status is comprised of more old workers; and 3) the proportion of union status is comprised of more old workers. As noted in the Data & Methods section above, the dependent variable, tenure, is leftskewed across all samples. While a tobit regression is traditionally used for such distributions, a preliminary test found that the ordinary least squares method was a better fit of the data than the



38

tobit method based on the resulting R2 values2. The allocation of the sample based on the criteria of the NOC 2011 skills matrix is provided in Tables 3a and 3b. For the 25 to 34 age group, skill level C had the highest proportion of respondents in the 1997 sample at 33.1%, and skill level B for the 2014 sample at 37.3%. For the 35 to 64 age group, skill level B had the highest proportion of respondents in the 1997 and 2014 samples, with 32% and 34% respectively. For both age groups in the 1997 and 2014 samples, the majority of respondents are categorized under skill levels B and C, while skill level D had the lowest proportion of respondents across both age groups in both samples. Relative to the 2014 sample, a higher proportion of respondents in the 1997 sample were categorized in lower skill levels. Skill level A, for example, saw a +1.8 percentage point difference between the 1997 and 2014 sample, which implies that a) young Canadians are now working in occupations with higher educational requirements, and b) more of this age cohort now has the education credentials to work in occupations with higher skill levels.

Due to technical limitations with IBM SPSS Statistics 24, the tobit regression model was tested using Stata 15.  39

Based on the job-education match classification outlined in 3.2.1, Table 4 outlines the dispersion of respondents based on the objective match between the educational requirements of an occupation based on the NOC 2011 taxonomy, and the highest level of education attained based on the LFS questionnaire. Both 1997 and 2014 samples indicate that of the three categories, the highest proportion of respondents are deemed matches; however, more than half of the sample in each year are categorized as being either over or underqualified. For example, the proportion of respondents in the younger age group that are deemed over and underqualified is 27.3% and 27.6% respectively. Of note is the increase in the proportion of overqualified respondents in the 25 to 34 age group between the 1997 and 2014 samples, from 27.3% to 32.3%. The 35 to 64 age group also saw an increase in the proportion of overqualified respondents, from 18.8% to 29.4% of the sample. The proportion of overqualified respondents is higher for the younger age group compared to the older age group in both the 1997 and 2014 samples, and conversely for the proportion of underqualified respondents. Overall, the job-education match classification suggests the proportion of overqualified respondents has increased across all ages of the sample and between the 1997 and 2014 samples.

Weighted descriptive statistics are provided for each of the models in Tables 5a and 5b. The mean age for the 25-34 and 35-64 age groups in 1997 are 29.8 and 45.3 respectively, while  40

the mean age for the 2014 age groups are 29.6 and 48.1 years. Mean tenure (in months) for both age groups are lower in the 2014 sample than the 1997 sample, with a 2.3-month difference for the 25 to 34 group, and a 3.5-month difference for the 35 to 64 group.

The difference between the R2 and adjusted R2 is nominal, which supports the cross-validity of the model. The F-statistic for each step in the regression model indicate the change in R2 is significant, p < .001. F-statistics for each step of the regression model, 9,611.15, p < .001; 22,449.69, p < .001; and 21,368.40, are all significant (p <



41

.001). Each step of the model significantly improves the ability to predict tenure, when compared to not fitting the model and using the mean of tenure.

Therefore, overqualification is negatively related to log tenure in months, and underqualification is positively associated with log tenure, all other predictors held constant. The t-statistics associated with the b-values for underqualified, t = 25.03, p < .001, and overqualified, t= -62.82, p < .001, suggest these predictors are making a significant contribution to the model. In Model 3 for the 25 to 34 age cohort in 1997, all control variables are statistically significant, p < .001, with the exception of NOC category 7: trades, transport and equipment operators and related occupations. For the older workers group, ages 35 to 65, the first two steps of the model accounted for 26.8% of the variation in log tenure in the 1997 sample, and the overqualified and underqualified predictors increased the model's R2 to 27.2%. Similar to the young workers sample, the adjusted R2 is marginally different from the R2 of the model, and the F-statistic at each step of the model is significant, p < .001. F-statistics of 16,461.20, p < .001; 68,388.641, p < .001; and 65,956.393, p



42

< .001; suggest each step of the model is significant in predicting tenure. The model parameters indicate a similar pattern to the young age group sample: a positive relationship between underqualified (b = 0.138) and log of tenure, and a negative relationship between overqualified (b = -0.221) and log of tenure. t-statistics of the b-values for underqualified, t = 103.40 and overqualified t = -155.41 make significant contributions to the model, p < .001. In Model 3 for the 35 to 64 age cohort in 1997, all control variables are statistically significant, including the previously insignificant NOC category 7 with the sample of young workers. 4.2.2 Sample Output, 2014 The model accounted for 14.9% of the variation in log tenure for the 2014 sample of young workers; the inclusion of the underqualified and overqualified predictors slightly increased the predictive power of the model, to an R2 value of 0.155%. The adjusted R2 is again only marginally different from the R2 value, and the F-statistics are significant at each level of the model: 9,046.43, p < .001; 17,099.02, p < .001; and 16,986, 21, p < .001. The model parameters indicate a positive relationship between log tenure and `underqualified' (b = 0.125), and a negative relationship with `overqualified' (b = -0.226). The t-statistics of these values (underqualified t = 60.87, and overqualified t = -141.53) are both significant, p < .001. In Model 3 of the 25 to 34 age cohort in 2014, all controls variables are statistically significant, with the exception of the `Grade 11-13, non-graduate' education level and NOC category 5, `Occupations in art, culture, recreation, and sport'. For the 35 to 64 age group, the model produced an R2 value of 0.211, again with a marginally different adjusted R2. F-statistics at each step (26,256.90, 66,444.22, and 66,127.61) are all significant, p < .001. The model parameters, as found in each of the previous samples above, found a positive unstandardized beta value for `underqualified' (b = 0.103) and negative unstandardized beta value for `overqualified' (b = -0.311). t-statistics for `underqualified' t = 83.48



43

and overqualified t = -289.29, are both significant, p < .001. Control variables in the model for the 35 to 64 age group are all statistically significant, with the exception of the Nova Scotia dummy variable.

The model produced a nominal R2 change of 0.001, and almost identical adjusted R2 value. The Fstatistics (step 1 = 75303.05, step 2 = 119497.96, step 3 = 115807.88, step 4 = 92508.716) are significant, p < .001 for each step of the model. The model parameters, summarized in Table 8, produced similar to the previous iterations: a positive unstandardized beta value for underqualified (b = 0.138) and a negative value for overqualified (b = -0.274). Key control variables in the model are statistically significant, including all occupation-related variables, particularly job status, sector status (public/private), union status, and NOC category. In Model 4, the only control variables not statistically significant are dummy variables for Nova Scotia and Quebec.

The interaction terms produced positive beta values for overyoung (whether the incidence of overqualified is different for younger workers, relative to older workers), underyoung (whether the incidence of underqualified is different for younger workers, relative to older workers), youngtime (whether the incidence of tenure is different for younger workers in 2014, relative to younger workers in 1997), and under3way (whether the incidence of underqualified and tenure is Table 8: Regression Model, Pooled Sample b Constant -0.723*** Underqualified 0.138*** Overqualified -0.274*** overyoung 0.146*** underyoung 0.021*** over2014 -0.023*** under2014 -0.071*** youngtime 0.088*** over3way -0.024*** under3way 0.072*** R² = 0.131 for Step 1 R² = 0.142 for Step 2 R² = 0.005 for Step 3 R² = 0.001 for Step 4 ***p < .001 different for younger workers, relative to older workers in 1997). Conversely, negative beta values are produced for over2014 (whether the incidence of overqualified is different for all workers in 2014, relative to all workers in 1997), under2014 (whether the incidence of underqualified is different for all workers in 2014, relative to 1997), and over3way (whether the incidence of overqualified and tenure is different for younger workers, relative to older workers in 1997). t-statistics (see Appendix 5) are all significant, p < .001. Detailed output from IBM SPSS Statistics 24 for each regression model iteration are found

in Appendix 5. The effects of underqualified and overqualified are further explored in Chapter 5 using Halvorsen & Palmquist's (1980) equation3 to transform the coefficients of both dummy variables to interpret their percentage effect on log tenure.

The relative effect on Y is g = exp(c) ­ 1, and the percentage effect is equal to 100g = 100 [EXP(c) ­ 1], where g = the relative effect on Y of the presence of the factor represented by the dummy variable, and c = the coefficient of the dummy variable.  45

Chapter 5: Discussion 5.1 Job-Education Match & Tenure Between Age Groups, Across Time The first model testing the 1997 and 2014 survey year samples individually estimates the relationship between job-education match levels and tenure patterns for each age group individually, controlling for all observable characteristics in the model. For younger workers, 1) being overqualified decreases length of tenure by 10.8% in 1997 and 20.2% in 2014; and 2) being underqualified increases length of tenure by 7.1% in 1997 and 13.3% in 2014. For older workers, 1) being overqualified decreases length of tenure by 14.8% in 1997 and 26.7% in 2014; and 2) being underqualified increases length of tenure by 14.8% in 1997 and 10.8% in 2014. All else held constant, the pooled model shows length of tenure decreases by 24% when an individual's match level is overqualified; for underqualified individuals, length of tenure increases by 14.8%. Therefore, the model suggests being underqualified has a positive relationship with tenure levels, and being overqualified has a negative relationship with tenure levels. This result aligns with hypothesis 1a which anticipated a negative relationship between overqualification and tenure for young Canadians; an overqualified job-education match status is related to a decrease of tenure in months; conversely, an underqualified job-education march status constitutes an increase of tenure in months. The negative relationship found between overqualification (based on job-education match) and tenure represents less time in months for young workers' in his/her primary job. Qualitatively, the two survey years show stronger negative effects from overqualification on length of tenure for the 2014 sample, compared to the 1997 sample; young workers, specifically, show a difference of 9.4% between survey years. As outlined in Chapter 3, a pooled sample of both survey years is tested to make statistical inferences and account for the differences between survey years and age groups. Step 4 of the



46

model, which includes the interaction terms, is statistically significant in improving the model's fit, p < .001; in addition, the effects of all interaction terms are statistically significant, p < .001, therefore the effect of job-education match (over/underqualified) has a different effect on tenure depending on the values of age and survey year. The overyoung interaction found a significant difference in the relationship between having an overqualified job-education match status and age. There is a positive relationship between the overyoung and underyoung interaction terms, which suggests that young workers are more likely to be overqualified relative to older workers (35 to 64), holding all controls and survey year constant. Therefore, over and underqualification is higher for younger workers, relative to older workers in the sample, which meets hypothesis 2a and 2b. The over2014 interaction found a difference in the rate of over/underqualification between survey years; a negative relationship between tenure and over/underqualified. The youngtime interaction also finds a significant positive difference in tenure levels between the 1997 and 2014 survey years for young workers. When observing the interaction terms, tenure decreased significantly more for older workers. The interaction terms included in the pooled model are statistically significant, indicating age and survey year moderate the relationship between job-education match levels and tenure. As per the person-job fit model, these estimates suggest the mismatch between the abilities of employees (e.g. education) and the demands of employers (e.g. job requirements) has produced reduced tenure levels as an outcome of such a mismatch, an effect which has become stronger across time between the 1997 and 2014 survey years. The findings of this study offer a number of implications for key stakeholders involved in the employment relationship, and more broadly, those involved in the school-to-work transition. The observed relationship between overqualification and tenure has consequences at the individual, organizational, and societal level.



47

At the individual level, job holders are faced with the incidence of a mismatch between his/her abilities and the demands of the employer. As per the person-job fit model, the lack of fit between these two elements produces the consequence of reduced length of tenure. At the organizational level, lower tenure levels have implications for the employers of affected young workers. While voluntary turnover cannot be definitively ascertained by this study's results, lower tenure signals higher occupation mobility for young workers. HR professionals, for example, should acknowledge the potential for shorter stays among this cohort of young workers, and implement recruitment strategies with the flexibility to account for roles typically filled by candidates of this age group and skillset. In addition, if overqualified employees are more likely to leave their position, and underqualified employees are more likely to remain in their position, this presents a unique challenge for HR professionals to attract talent to remain with an organization. Learning and development costs could conceivably be an added cost of business for remaining employees, if job-education mismatch is an indicator of the skills individuals accumulate from education credentials. From the perspective of educational institutions, particularly at the post-secondary level, these findings signal the need for better alignment with employers with regards to skill development. Considering the rising number of graduates, the persistence of job-education mismatch suggests the acquired skills of many graduates (Frenette, 2004; Fenesi & Sana, 2015) are not fully utilized in the labour market. At the societal level, the job-education match rates measured across survey years corroborates the observed trend of increasing school stays among young people in Canada (Grant, 2016); these estimates reiterate a mismatch not only between the job requirements and education credentials of young workers, but a mismatch between the accumulated skills from education credentials and skills sought in the labour market by employers. This discrepancy signals a need



48

for policy changes by provincial governments to improve the school-to-work transition experiences of young Canadians by promoting more collaboration between educational institutions, particularly at the post-secondary level, and employers. Experiential learning, for example, has been increasingly recognized for its tangible benefits for graduates in Ontario (Sattler & Peters, 2013). 5.2 Limitations & Areas for Future Research A number of limitations regarding this study's analysis should be noted; first, the jobeducation match criteria used in this analysis is based on the job analysis approach using the NOC 2011 taxonomy, which is an inherently broad measure. The parameters of the education requirements for individual occupations are presented as a range of possible alternatives, with terminology such as `usually required' and `may be required' in addition to definite requirements (Statistics Canada, 2012). To ensure a more definitive classification, this analysis adopted the NOC 2011 skills matrix, which plots occupational categories into four skill levels with a clearer range of education credentials, which were paired with existing LFS survey response categories. Second, due to the absence of LFS survey questions regarding individuals' field of study, this variable cannot be measured in the analysis. The lack of available data on field of study can be attributed to the inactive status of the National Graduates Survey (NGS), as noted in Chapter 3. While the NGS would have offered relevant survey data on key variables, particularly field of study, the survey has traditionally been used for subjective measures of overqualification, as the survey questions ask respondents of his/her perceptions of overqualification. The LFS was adopted to satisfy the most possible amount of necessary variables, and its large sample size for the age groups make it a suitable alternative for studies conducting an objective measure of overqualification. Also noted in Chapter 2, the LFS does not directly measure turnover, and



49

therefore the present study cannot make definitive conclusions regarding the distinction between voluntary and involuntary forms of turnover based on length of service. Future research using subjective measures would greatly benefit from utilizing a similar Canada-wide dataset with education-specific questions on individuals' perceptions of his/her employment situation. Third, the sample size restriction of two survey months in order to avoid duplicate responses from participants in the LFS rotational survey could affect the number of people employed in the sample, due to non-standard employment (e.g. seasonal, casual, temporary positions). Considering the proportion of young people employed in a temporary work arrangement, the sample might not fully capture the number of young people employed at a given time in an entire year (Morisette, Hou, & Schellenberg, 2015). Seasonal employment, for example, might be a more common occurrence during peak business months, such as holiday hours for the sales and service industry, which are not captured by January and July survey months. The survey months are of nominal concern, however, considering the large sample size obtained for both age groups, and the scope of the LFS across all provinces, are representative of the working population in Canada in these survey years. In addition to the sample restriction based on survey months, the present analysis does not account for the number of hours worked, which may fluctuate between respondents, particularly those with non-permanent status. Job status is included as a control variable in the present analysis, while acknowledging the limited interpretability of the work experiences of individual respondents without the inclusion of hours worked. In regards to future research on overqualification, it would be beneficial to incorporate the field of study individuals pursue (Frenette, 2001; Finnie, 2004; Walters, 2016), particularly among young Canadians, to measure match levels relative to the remaining working population. Further research might also include both field of study and graduates of all education levels across an



50

extended period of time to interpret the trends of education attainment across time, and the effect education choices have on length of service and other relevant employment outcomes for young people. While the present study has used education as a measure of overqualification, future research might incorporate other measures to produce a more holistic estimate. As per the personjob fit model, for example, an objective measurement might include relevant work experience and related field of study, in addition to education credentials that align with the individual's job requirements. Future research might also address the trend of increasing postsecondary graduates in Canada noted earlier by determining whether education credentials have gained or decreased in relevance with occupations held by young workers.

Chapter 6: Conclusion In summation, this study investigated the relationship between job-education match and tenure levels for young workers in Canada, which is found to be statistically significant for both age cohorts sampled: young workers, ages 25 to 34, and older workers, aged 35 to 64. Of note are the negative relationships observed for both age cohorts between length of service and workers deemed overqualified, in addition to the moderating effects of age and survey year on tenure. As per the person-job fit model, the job-related outcome of tenure was associated with a mismatch between the demands of the employer, observed using NOC 2011 job requirements, and the abilities of the employee, observed using individuals' highest education credentials measured in the LFS. While several studies have estimated the returns to educational attainment, particularly among postsecondary graduates, the present analysis offers a large sample of LFS survey respondents in the 25 to 34 age group at all education levels and occupations, which provides a wider scope for interpreting the persistence of overqualification in the Canadian labour market.



51

The findings of this study contribute to the theoretical perspectives on overqualification research, particularly from a management perspective. First, these findings support the person-job fit model which includes tenure as an outcome of fit (or mis-fit) at the individual level, by determining the compatibility between an individual's abilities and employer's demands (Edwards, 1991). Additionally, the significant results obtained for the over/underqualified job-education match levels supports the use of overeducation as a framework for investigating congruence. Second, based on the set of economic assumptions and definition of objective overqualification established by Feldman (1996), this study's findings corroborate the measurement of underemployment based on individuals possessing more education than is required in the job using a job analysis approach (Hartog, 2000) to compare an individual's accumulated skills to the most common formal requirements in a given occupation. Third, these findings provide support for future research to account for both age and survey year when investigating vertical mismatch. A number of practical implications arise from these findings, particularly for stakeholders involved in the school-to-work transition. Based on the effect of job-education mismatch observed between the 2014 and 1997 surveys, job holders may accrue tenure from several rather than a few organizations in his/her career, as evidenced by shorter length of service patterns among young overqualified workers. The effects of mismatch on tenure also has implications for HR professionals, tasked with attracting and retaining talent within an organization. In addition to recruitment strategies to address such occupational mobility, an organization's approach to learning and development may also require modifications by offering the necessary opportunities for professional development to bring underqualified workers to a `match'. More broadly, the incidence of job-education mismatch can serve as an indicator for the need to better align the demands of the workplace with the abilities of graduates in Canada.
