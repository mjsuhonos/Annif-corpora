   Personalia  And  Women's  Spatial  Practices  In  the  Routine  Office   Doctor  of  Philosophy  ,  2015.       Lynn  Chalmers.       Joint  Graduate  Program  of  Communication  and  Culture,  Ryerson  and  York  Universities.  

      ABSTRACT  
      Office  design  is  a  contemporary  cultural  discourse,  where  space  is  conceived  in  abstract   terms.  Organizations  mission  and  purpose  are  translated  into  the  spatial  design  of   workplaces.  In  the  most  dominant  sectors  such  as  finance  and  banking  neoliberal   organizations  operate  around  the  space  of  flows,  generated  by  globalization,  technology   and  postmodernity  (Castells,  2000).  The  space  of  flows  is  also  manifest  in  the  spatial   design  of  the  workplace  shaping  employees'  working  identities  and  behaviours.  The   dissertation  asserts  that  there  are  two  classes  of  office  workers  evolving  in  the   workplace:  the  professional  knowledge  workers  who  are  increasingly  mobile  and   autonomous;  and  the  routine  clerical  workers  who  are  captive  in  a  hegemonic  system   that  keeps  them  doing  clerical  work  with  little  prospect  of  promotion.  It  is  significant   that  the  clerical  class  is  composed  mostly  of  women.  Personalia  and  Women's  Spatial   Practices  In  The  Routine  Office  examines  the  head  offices  of  Investors  Group  in   Winnipeg,  Canada,  in  terms  of  how  the  company's  offices  both  reflect  and  generate   spaces  of  flows.  Women's  participation  rates  have  grown  from  being  a  small  minority  in   the  1900s  to  approximately  70%  of  the  clerical  workforce  in  the  2000s.  Through   microanalysis  of  previously  unexamined  personalia,  or  personal  objects  at  the  desk,  the   dissertation  finds  work  spaces  are  expressive  of  women's  lived  experiences  of  work.  By   conducting  interviews  and  photographic  studies  of  the  workspaces  of  11  women  at   Investors  Group  the  research  uncovers  the  ways  women  use  the  personalia  at  their      iii  

desks  to  reappropriate  the  everyday  spaces  of  the  office.  The  identification  of  the  term   personalia  becomes  a  key  concept  in  the  work  and  a  contribution  to  the  study  of  the   close  environment  of  the  office  desk.  Social  networks  with  co-workers,  past  and  present   are  honored  in  the  personalia  at  the  desk;  and  tactics  such  as  repurposing  office  supplies   as  gifts,  along  with  numerous  individual  and  heterogeneous  behaviours  demonstrate   that  routine  work  spaces  are  not  neutral  spaces,  but  are  open  to  the  expressive   practices  which  de  Certeau  calls  operations.  The  ways  that  women  make  space  for   themselves  and  push  against  the  hegemony  of  the  neoliberal  organization  are  specific   and  instructive.  They  reflect  women's  values  and  the  identities  crafted  for  public  and   private  consumption.  The  research  closely  examines  the  practices  of  women  in  the   financial  services  industry  through  the  filter  of  Lefebvre's  trialectic  for  the  analysis  of   space  (1991),  de  Certeau's  ways  of  operating  and  tactics  (1998),  and  Franck's   interpretation  of  Women's  Ways  of  Knowing  (1989;  2000).  The  research  demonstrates   how  personalia  in  the  contemporary  workplace  reflects  women's  values,  and  how   women's  values  have  influenced  the  design  of  the  workplace.

   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  
      I  have  been  extraordinarily  lucky  to  have  Dr.  Janine  Marchessault  as  my  advisor.   Her  positive  support  and  unusual  openness  was  critical  to  completing  this  journey.     She  is  a  believer  and  kept  that  alive  in  me.  I  also  really  appreciated  Dr.  Michael   Prokopow's  willingness  to  stay  connected  to  the  work,  and  his  comments  have  always   been  generous  and  thoughtful.    Professor  George  Kapelos  graciously  stepped  in  to  be   my  Ryerson  University  committee  member.  I  have  had  amazing  support  from  Ryerson,   from  Jo  Anne  Mackie,  the  graduate  student  advisor  who  helped  me  navigate  the   bureaucracy  and  from  Dr.  Paul  Moore  and  Dr.  Jennifer  Mactavish,  who  put  a  kind  face   on  the  bureaucracy  and  gave  me  the  opportunity  to  complete  what  had  become  an   extended  trip.  My  external  readers  Professor  Lois  Weinthal  and  Dr  Jacqueline  Vischer   brought  a  different  perspective  to  the  work  that  allowed  for  a  stimulating  and  very   productive  discussion,  along  with  a  number  of  revisions  that  I  believe  have  improved   and  distilled  its  contribution.  I  am  very  grateful  for  your  insights.      The  journey  included  a  number  of  moves,  two  weddings,  the  birth  of  a   grandbaby,  a  term  as  Acting  Head  of  the  Department  of  Interior  Design,  lots  of  teaching   and  my  partner's  surgeries  including  hip  replacements.    I  have  enjoyed  almost  every   part  of  it  and  learned  enough  to  know  now  how  much  I  don't  know.      My  partner,  my  children  and  their  partners  have  been  continuously  supportive   and  generous  throughout.  They  have  been  there  to  encourage,  to  listen  and  to  help   whenever  and  however  they  could.  Jo  and  Darcy  moved  their  lives  to  Toronto  so  I  could   start  the  Ph.D.    Victor  stayed  in  Winnipeg  and  looked  after  our  dog  and  cat.    I  guess  they   all  knew  how  much  this  has  meant  to  me.      Investors  Group  should  also  feature  on  this  list  of  those  to  whom  I  am  grateful.   Without  their  co-operation  and  preparedness  to  give  me  access  to  their  information,  the   work  would  not  exist.  I  thank  Dr.  Richard  Irish,  now  retired,  Allan  Heibert,  Roberta   Verdonck-Milne,  Shannon  Boulanger,  Lisa  Tottle  and  Lori-Ann  Thibodeau.    Most      v  

especially  I  would  like  to  thank  the  women  I  interviewed,  as  their  participation  allowed   me  to  explore  an  area  that  has  fascinated  me  since  becoming  a  designer.    I  should  also   thank  Art  Mauro  who  generously  gave  his  time,  as  did  Dick  Archer,  Jim  August  and  Neil   McMillan.      My  sincere  thanks  to  Christopher  Budd  at  Studio  Architects,  Washington.  Always   the  engaged  practitioner,  his  appreciation  and  knowledge  of  research  and  its  ability  to   inform  practice  is  an  inspiration.    There  were  so  many  people  who  answered  my   questions  and  dug  out  information  for  me,  including  Canadian  designers  Leonie  Glenat,   Anita  Jones,  Eleanor  Brydone  and  Gail  Tyshynski.        Miriam  Unruh,  Director  of  the  Academic  Learning  Centre  at  the  University  of   Manitoba  also  deserves  a  special  vote  of  thanks  for  seeing  me  through  the  last  and  most   challenging  stages  of  the  writing  and  ensuring  at  least  some  of  it  made  sense.  Her   friendship  is  a  lasting  product  of  this  work.  Friends  and  colleagues  Mary  Anne  Beecher,   Debra  Scott,  Ian  Skelton,  Iara  Lessa  and  Susan  Close,  cheered  me  through  the  dark  days.      Rose  Kuzina  shepherded  me  through  editorial  minefields  but  the  mistakes  in  the   work  are  all  mine.  Jo  Chalmers,  your  talent  and  patience  in  helping  with  the  visual   composites  is  very  much  appreciated.           This  journey  is  nearly  done.  I  am  grateful  and  very  pleased  to  be  completing  it.  I   Thank  you  all  !                           have  grown  and  I  am  look  forward  to  the  next  adventure.

      INTRODUCTION  
      My  curiosity  about  the  office  began  as  a  new  graduate  from  an  interior  design   program  in  Australia.    Office  design  was  a  primary  source  of  work  for  interior  design   practices  at  the  time  and  one  of  my  tasks  as  a  young  designer  was  to  evaluate  space  and   furniture  requirements  for  individual  workers.  This  involved  surveying  how  people   worked  at  their  desks  and  recording  the  existing  conditions  of  workers,  such  as  how   much  desk  surface  and  storage  they  needed  to  perform  their  jobs,  and  on  which  side   they  located  their  phone.        In  the  1980s  computerized  spreadsheets  were  not  commonplace  and  the  work   involved  extended  periods  of  time  spent  in  back  offices  and  fairly  dreary  environments   talking  to  the  users  of  the  space.    By  the  time  I  had  finished  those  existing  condition   surveys  I  had  a  well-developed  sense  of  what  it  was  like  to  spend  time  in  the  spaces  of   routine  office  work.    As  an  idealistic  young  designer  I  was  excited  about  how  design   might  bring  change  and  improve  the  lot  of  office  workers.    I  had  developed  an  empathy   for  the  necessary  but  unexciting  roles  that  routine  office  workers  play  in  organizations   and  an  interest  in  how  these  workers  claimed  their  space.        The  definition  of  routine  office  work  used  in  the  dissertation  is  repetitious  office   administrative  functions  performed  by  white  collar  workers,  the  work  may  be  routine   but  it  is  not  unskilled.  Routine  clerical  workers  are  those  workers  whose  tasks  require   them  to  be  located  at  a  desk  and  in  an  office  for  their  working  week.    They  perform   skilled  clerical  tasks  that  require  peer  support  and  consultation  making  them  difficult  to   perform  remotely,  they  also  can  be  confidential  in  nature.      Thirty  or  so  years  later  the  change  that  has  affected  ways  of  working  has  been   profound.  The  radical  shifts  that  technology  and  globalization  have  wrought  have   unleashed  and  mobilized  a  new  class  of  knowledge  workers,  allowing  them  to  work  from   home  or  on  the  move.    However  routine  office  workers  are  still  tethered  to  their  desks   in  Winnipeg  and  in  cities  around  the  globe  where  labour  costs  are  relatively  cheap.          1  

  
   Clerical  work  became  normalized  for  married  women  in  the  1950s  and  60s,  just   as  our  expanding  need  to  consume  increased  the  pressure  for  dual  family  incomes,   rendering  the  role  of  stay-at  home  mother  untenable  for  most.    My  research  seeks  to   understand  the  ways  in  which  women  are  embodied  through  the  personalia  at  their   desks,  in  the  physical  environments  of  routine  office  work.          Personalia  is  defined  in  the  Chambers  Twentieth  Century  Dictionary  as  "notes,   anecdotes,  or  particulars  relating  to  persons."    Webster  New  World  Dictionary  defines   the  term  as  "personal  details  concerning,  or  personal  items  associated  with,  a  persons   life."    I  have  co-opted  this  term  in  the  dissertation  to  mean  the  personal  objects  on  the   desk  that  are  associated  with  the  persons  life;  their  work  life  and  their  life  beyond  the   office.      For  the  women  interviewed  in  this  study  the  coloured  sticky  notes  and  staplers   were  as  much  a  reflection  of  their  values  and  preferences  as  other  objects  gifted  or   brought  from  home.    The  identification  of  the  term  becomes  a  key  concept  in  the  work   and  a  contribution  to  the  study  of  the  close  environment  of  the  office  desk.      When  I  was  searching  for  examples  of  phenomenological  case  study  research  I   was  directed  to  Women  in  Trouble  by  social  worker  and  academic  Elizabeth  McCormack.     The  book  is  framed  by  the  researchers  interviews  with  women  in  prison  to  look  at  the   systemic  problems  of  incarceration.  The  profound  issues  that  were  evident  in  every   interview  shocked  me.  Not  surprisingly,  the  women  came  from  backgrounds  of  abuse   and  neglect  and  were  caught  in  cycles  of  destructive  behaviours.    The  research  in  which  I   was  engaged  in  seemed  irrelevant  and  introspective  by  comparison,  I  questioned  why  I   would  make  something  so  mundane  as  the  personalization  of  the  desk  as  the  focus  for  a   dissertation.      However,  my  interest  in  the  everyday  of  the  office  has  been  with  me  for  a  long   time.  I  addressed  workplace  change  in  my  Masters  of  Design  thesis  in  the  90s  and  after   discovering  the  theories  of  the  everyday  in  Lefebvre  and  DeCerteau  I  found  a  place  to   uncover  and  expose  the  subtle  and  often  gendered  practices  of  resistance  that  I  had   been  made  aware  of  by  my  early  experiences  in  design.  I  was  generously  given  insights   into  the  personal  spaces  and  personalia  of  the  women  who  participated  in  the  photo-    2  

  
elicitation  research  and  felt  a  responsibility  to  value  their  everyday  lives.  Investors   Group  opened  their  archives  to  me  and  the  retired  designers  who  were  responsible  for   Investors  Group  headquarters  interiors  gave  me  access  to  their  records  and  information.        The  dissertation  is  informed  by  De  Certeau's  sociological  studies  of  the  everyday   in  Paris.  His  research  methods  involved  observations  and  narratives  of  his  subjects  going   about  their  everyday  lives.    The  research  situates  the  11  women  and  their  occupation  of   the  borrowed  space  of  the  office  uncovering  the  culture  of  the  organization  from  the   perspective  of  the  women.  The  research  is  essentially  speculative  and  observational  in   nature.      Much  of  the  research  into  the  design  of  the  office  has  been  carried  out  or  funded   by  office  furniture  manufacturers  and  is  directed  toward  increasing  productivity,   carrying  an  intrinsic  bias  towards  generating  new  product  design  and  increasing   consumption  (O'Neill  2008,  2009,  2010).    Most  other  spatially  oriented  researchers   addressing  workplace  are  working  in  the  area  of  environment  and  behaviour  (Hedge   1987,  Brill  et  al  1985),  or  organizational  psychology  (Vischer  1996,  2005,  Steele  and   Jenks  1977).  In  contrast,  my  concern  in  this  research  was  to  apply  cultural  and  critical   theories  to  the  workplace  to  create  a  richer  understanding  of  the  micro  details  of  how   the  everyday  space  of  the  office  is  occupied.    What  might  the  occupation  of  routine   workspace  tell  us  about  women's  roles,  values  and  ways  of  operating?    Second  wave   Feminist  Standpoint  theory  (Franck  1989)  and  Women's  Ways  of  Knowing  (Belenky  et.   al.  1986)  provide  an  important  framework  for  this  dissertation  as  explained  further  in   Chapter  One.  I  use  it  as  Lucinda  Havenhand  (2004)  suggests,  to  understand  women's   values  and  ways  of  operating,  and  as  a  vehicle  for  examining  what  might  represent   women's  space  and  how  it  might  differ  from  spaces  occupied  and  understood  as  men's   space.   Personalia  ­  new  methods  for  spatial  research.      This  dissertation  develops  a  new  method  for  analysing  office  environments  for   the  discipline  of  interior  design  by  studying  the  personalia  and  close  space  of  the  desk   and  the  embodied  behaviours  of  those  that  occupy  it.    I  question  existing  assumptions      3  

  
about  the  meaning  of  personalia  on  the  office  desk,  and  develop  a  base  line  associated   with  personal  occupation  to  encourage  further  research  in  this  area.        Lefebvre's  theory  of  the  everyday  provides  the  optimistic  view  that  everyday  life   that  cannot  be  contained  by  bureaucratic  regimentation,  harbouring  the  desire  that   generates  transformation  through  celebrations  and  domestic  pleasures.  The  dissertation   study  uses  phenomenological  methods  to  understand  how  this  transformation  occurs.     The  work  does  not  address  a  hypothesis  but  researches  with  the  intention  of  reflecting   on  the  creation  of  women's  complex  identities  as  co-workers,  friends,  mothers,  and   aunties,  and  to  understand  women's  values  as  reflected  in  their  personalization  of  the   desk.      Lefebvre's  understanding  of  transformation  occurs  through  small  celebratory   gestures,  memorials  and  remainders.    This  dissertation  with  its  microscopic  study  of   personalia  at  the  desk  facilitates  the  flow  of  social  discourse  as  a  means  to  understand   and  interpret  artefacts  and  individuals  that  are  usually  overlooked  in  the  neoliberal   organization.      The  framework  used  for  analysis  emerges  from  the  women's  voices,  containing   themes  that  are  consistent  across  a  number  of  the  interviews  and  observations.     The  observations  don't  fall  into  tidy  categories  and  many  of  the  issues  overlap  and   represent  multiple  and  conflicting  constructions.      The  conclusions  are  not  fixed  in  place   and  are  open  to  reassessment  and  re-  evaluation  bringing  attention  to  the  office  as  the   site  of  gendered  spatial  relations.      The  work  reinforces  the  notion  of  personalia  at  the  desk  as  representations  of   Lefebvre's  lived  space.    Sketching  out  a  moment  in  time  and  space  for  the  ephemeral   activity  of  individualization  of  the  desk.      Susan  Halford,  sociologist  and  researcher,  determines  that  the  spatial  is  an   important  adjunct  to  traditional  organizational  research  carried  out  in  sociology.  She   depicts  office  design  as  a  contemporary  cultural  discourse,  where  space  is  conceived  in   abstract  terms,  suggesting  "spatial  discourse  shapes  the  production  of  working  selves  ­   who  we  are  at  work  and  how  we  understand  our  working  identities"  (Halford  2008:932).      4  

  
Halford  advocates  for  research  that  "pays  greater  attention  to  the  agency  of  individuals   and  groups  in  responding  to  organisational  space"(2008:932).        The  subject  of  women  office  workers  and  how  they  craft  their  own  identities  in   the  office  environment  is  important  because  it  addresses  a  population  and  a   phenomenon  that  often  goes  unnoticed.  Studies  of  workplaces  are  most  often  focused   on  productivity  and  satisfaction.    They  consider  environmental  conditions  but  do  not   look  closely  at  the  occupied  environment  for  individual  ways  of  subverting  and  taking   ownership  of  space.  Much  has  been  written  about  the  emergence  of  a  new  class  of   knowledge  workers  who  have  quickly  become  the  privileged  class  of  office  workers.  By   comparison  routine  office  workers  are  often  contracted  employees  whose  work  is   located  at  a  dedicated  workstation,  their  work  is  stressful  and  constant.    Routine   workers  are  organized  into  highly  supervised  teams  that  offer  each  other  support  to   solve  more  complex  problems.        The  work  capitalizes  on  women's  ways  of  working  that  are  more  collaborative   and  social,  and  the  work  force  in  this  area  is  largely  female.  The  ways  that  women  make   space  for  themselves  and  push  back  are  multifaceted  and  fascinating.    This  study  brings   attention  to  them.  The  contribution  of  the  thesis  is  to  study  the  personalia  that   embodies  the  workplaces  of  women  routine  office  workers  in  the  financial  industry  as   subjects  of  a  hegemonic  system  that  contains  and  restricts  them  by  enforcing  a  class   structure.    The  research  method  I  employed  allowed  for  the  research  subjects  to  be   engaged  in  the  study,  photo  elicitation  allowed  for  subjective  and  emotional  content  to   be  offered  up  and  valued.  Balenky  et  al's    Ways  of  Knowing  is  applied  by  Havenhand   (2004)  to  a  consideration  of  women  interior  designers.  Havenhand  provides  a  language   to  discuss  values  that  frame  feminist  identities  and  is  reflected  in  the  case  study  analysis   and  the  conclusion      The  dissertation  reflects  on  issues  that  have  been  of  interest  to  me  for  many   years  as  an  interior  design  practitioner,  then  as  a  studio  professor  teaching  interior   design.  My  problem  was  always  how  to  research  the  topic  of  the  workplace  from  the   perspective  of  personal  worlds.  As  I  was  developing  the  dissertation  topic  I  carried  out  a      5  

  
small  study  in  an  interior  design  office  in  Toronto,  looking  at  the  individual  tactics  of   employees  in  adapting  the  workplace  to  meet  their  needs.  I  was  delighted  to  have  my   hunches  confirmed,  noting  all  sorts  of  borrowed  furniture  and  office  paraphernalia  were   being  employed  to  create  personal  spaces  for  these  creative  workers.  I  was  unable  to   interview  the  employees  whose  desks  I  had  studied  and  realized  the  problems  when  the   subjects  are  not  engaged.  The  research  conclusions  were  limited  to  my  own   assumptions  about  participant  motivations  and  I  resolved  to  ensure  the  PhD  research   would  actively  engage  my  subjects'  perspectives.      In  2008  was  invited  to  observe  a  design  project  in  the  programming  phases  with   Christopher  Budd  at  Studios  Architects.    The  project  was  for  a  new  building  for  Olmstead   County,  bringing  together  disparate  social  services  organizations  under  one  roof.    The   challenge  was  to  understand  the  different  organizational  cultures  and  practices  that   were  being  brought  into  close  proximity  for  the  first  time.    The  part  of  Budd's  process   that  I  observed  involved  using  image  cards  to  generate  a  focus  group  discussion  about   the  values  of  each  unit  and  their  hopes  and  dreams  in  moving  to  a  new  way  of   operating.    The  process  involved  individuals  selecting  images  in  response  to  prompts   such  as  "choose  an  image  that  reflects  how  your  work  group  feels  now",  the   rationalizations  for  individual  choices  generated  subjective  emotional  content  and   discussion  that  would  not  have  occurred  as  part  of  the  usual  programming  phases  of  a   large  project.  It  was  a  form  of  photo-elicitation  that  brought  the  employees  perspectives   into  focus  and  generated  information  that  allowed  the  designers  to  respond  to   emotional  knowledge  rather  than  the  more  usual  mapping  of  the  organizations  needs   and  vision.        I  employed  the  method  with  students  in  a  project  redesigning  the  offices  of  a   Winnpeg  film  production  company  Buffalo  Gals.    The  management  of  the  firm   participated  in  a  process  where  image  cards  were  used  in  response  to  questions  such  as   "choose  an  image  to  sum  up  the  management  philosophy  for  the  new  offices".    One   participant  selected  an  image  of  a  group  of  nuns,  singing  in  a  field.  She  explained  the   new  offices  should  be  egalitarian  and  empowering,  encouraging  open  communication      6  

  
between  all  who  worked  there.      The  image  proved  very  powerful  in  helping  design   students  understand  what  was  important  to  the  group  of  women  who  worked  in  an   atypical  non-hierarchical  organizational  structure.    The  student's  design  solutions  were   very  responsive  to  the  client's  requests  for  a  flat  management  structure  where  open   communication  was  a  significant  aspect  of  how  work  gets  done.        Interior  design  is  a  profession  that  builds  on  the  designer's  capacity  to  elicit   invisible  ways  of  operating.    It  is  empathetic  at  its  best  and  visual  research  methods  help   to  connect  designers  to  clients  experience  and  emotional  knowledge,  unlocking  very   human  responses  to  space  that  help  us  to  get  beneath  the  surface  of  an  organization  in   ways  that  surveys  and  standardized  methods  struggle  to  achieve.        Structure  of  the  Dissertation        In  this  study,  I  examine  the  years  prior  to  1960  to  establish  the  character  of   offices  leading  up  to  World  War  II  and  then  the  five  decades  up  until  1990.  Using  the   case  study  of  the  Investors  Group  head  offices  in  the  period  between  1956  and  2000,   the  research  illustrates  the  seismic  shift  in  factors  affecting  the  design  of  office  space  at   this  time.    The  Investors  Group  (IG)  organization  proved  to  be  a  good  subject  for  the   project  reflecting  the  astonishing  growth  of  the  financial  sector  in  this  period  -  having   commissioned  and  built  new  head  offices  on  Broadway  in  1956,  expanded  by  three   floors  in  1963;  and  embracing  a  completely  new  concept  of  head  offices  for  the  One   Canada  Centre,  completed  in  1987.  The  history  of  the  organization  as  a  Canadian  leader   in  the  financial  services  industry  bridges  between  high  modernist  design,  influenced  by   Taylorism,  and  post  modernism,  with  its  greater  focus  on  the  Human  Relations   Movement.  These  were  the  most  significant  influences  on  the  design  of  office  in  the  last   half  of  the  20th  century  and  coincided  with  the  professionalization  of  interior  design.   The  projects  at  IG  demonstrate  the  changes  in  the  environmental  design  professions.   The  first  head  office  building  in  1956  was  designed  by  architects  and  furnished  by   furniture  retailers  and  decorators  in  the  modernist  tradition,  but  by  1987  a  professional   interior  design  company  was  commissioned  at  the  same  time  as  the  architects  to      7  

  
develop  the  new  building  concept  and  orchestrate  the  fitting  out  of  the  building  and  the   staging  of  the  move.  One  Canada  Centre  proved  to  be  an  unusual  and  early  example  of   integrated  design  where  the  interior  designers  served  as  significant  players  in  the  design   and  construction  process.  Although  the  University  of  Manitoba  (where  I  work)  has   partnerships  with  IG  that  allowed  me  to  connect  with  their  senior  management  getting   permission  to  photograph  workstations  and  interview  routine  clerical  workers  was  not   easy.    IG  offered  me  management  desks  as  an  alternative  but  I  was  interested  in  routine   clerical  workers  and  they  finally  agreed  to  connect  me  with  12  volunteer  subjects.  It  was   important  to  me  that  my  research  address  routine  clerical  workers,  as  the  group  of   office  workers  who  had  received  the  least  attention  and  recognition  in  studies  of  the   design  of  office  environments.  It  was  only  as  the  work  progressed  that  I  became  aware   of  the  large  predomination  of  women  who  perform  routine  clerical  functions  in  the   finance  sector  and  I  shifted  the  focus  of  the  dissertation  to  address  this  rarely   acknowledged  phenomena.      The  first  chapter  reviews  the  literature  and  methodologies  that  provide  the   background  for  the  dissertation.  Chapter  Two  addresses  women,  work  and  spatial   environments  that  support  work.  It  will  analyze  the  management  theory  that  has   determined  the  nature  of  the  physical  space  for  office  work  looking  at  the  shift  from   hierarchical  disciplined  organizations  inspired  by  Taylorism  to  flatter  management   structures  that  support  teams,  collaborative  working  and  different  forms  of  supervision   and  production  resulting  from  neoliberalism  and  globalization.        The  third  chapter  considers  Manuel  Castells  "space  of  flows"  in  relation  to  the   finance  sector  and  patterns  of  employment.    It  introduces  Winnipeg  as  the  home  of  the   Investors  Group  headquarters.    The  chapter  provides  a  context  for  the  idea  of  a  building   designed  for  the  financial  services  industry  in  the  1980s  with  its  largely  female  clerical   workforce  and  looks  at  the  rapid  evolution  of  technology  as  the  generator  of  new  ways   of  working.        Chapter  Four  discusses  the  commodification  of  office  buildings  and  the  evolution   of  interior  design  services  as  new  ways  of  thinking  about  the  design  of  offices.  The      8  

  
chapter  expands  on  Feminist  Standpoint  theory  and  Women's  Ways  of  Knowing  as   structures  for  the  analysis  of  office  environments  from  the  perspective  of  the  women   who  work  there.    The  interior  design  of  One  Canada  Place  is  analyzed  through  this  filter,   and  is  compared  to  Broadgate  in  London.      Chapter  Five  introduces  the  photo-elicitation  research  bringing  the  women's   voices  and  artefacts  into  the  dissertation  through  the  narratives  and  visual  composites   of  the  photographs  of  the  women's  desks.    This  evidence  allows  for  the  analysis  that   follows  in  Chapter  Six.        Chapter  Six  brings  focus  to  the  desks  and  personalia  of  the  routine  clerical   workers  at  Investors  Group.  A  model  for  the  analysis  is  developed  and  employed  to   uncover  complex  values  and  social  networks  that  are  represented  by  the  personalia  and   spatial  practices  and  tactics  of  the  women.      The  conclusion  draws  the  disparate  elements  of  the  dissertation  together  to   argue  for  the  benefits  of  a  phenomenological  inquiry  that  attends  to  the  spatial.    It   demonstrates  the  need  for  greater  consultation  in  the  design  process  with  the  routine   clerical  workers  of  organizations,  in  ways  that  give  them  greater  control  and  more   socially-oriented  spaces  that  respond  to  women's  practices  and  ways  of  knowing.       Desk  spaces  should  be  provided  with  adequate  space  around  the  screen  and  ancillary   pinup  space  that  encourages  employees  to  curate  collections  of  personalia  and  in  so   doing  participate  in  growing  the  social  networks  of  organizations  in  unstructured  and   organic  ways  that  enable  them  to  have  greater  freedom  and  control.

   CHAPTER  ONE    

   LITERATURE  REVIEW  AND  METHODOLOGY  
   Spaces  of  Flows  and  Spaces  of  Constraint      Edward  Said,  academic  and  post-colonial  theorist,  has  commented  that  mobility   and  migration  are  the  markers  of  our  time  (Said  1994).  The  cities  of  the  21st  century  are   responding  to  the  impact  of  telematics,  computer  networks,  telecommunications,  global   economic  dispersal  and  centralization.  Spatial  dispersal  of  economic  activity  has  been   made  possible  by  telematics  and  contributes  to  an  expansion  of  central  functions.  Cities   are  the  preferred  sites  for  the  production  of  services  particularly  for  the  most  innovative   and  internationalized  service  sectors.  Cities  have  always  served  as  the  sites  for  the   production  of  finance  and  advanced  corporate  services.    Saskia  Sassen  asserts  that   today's  global  cities  are  in  part  the  "spaces  of  post-colonialism"  with  the  transmigration   of  rich  and  poor.    Both  groups  lay  claim  to  space,  creating  conflict.    Sassen  suggests  the   rich,  the  new  transnational  professional  knowledge  workers,  can  change  the  social   morphology  of  cities  with  very  little  resistance,  "reconstituting  strategic  spaces  in  the   city  in  their  own  images"  (1997:131).    According  to  Manuel  Castells,  sociologist  and   philosopher,  the  "most  dominant  functions  in  our  society  are  organized  around  the   space  of  flows  "(2000:14),  referring  to  financial  markets,  transnational  production  works   and  media  systems.  The  space  of  flows  relates  directly  to  the  increasing  globalization   associated  with  neoliberalism  and  post-modernity.        In  this  dissertation  I  assert  in  that  global  flows  of  information  and  capital  are   visible  in  the  offices  of  financial  institutions.  But  these  flows  have  created  a  tide  that   leaves  many  routine  office  workers  in  its  wake.  Those  with  limited  access  to  new   technologies  of  empowerment  are  locked  into  nine-to-five  jobs  that  are  at  the  ugly  edge   of  the  knowledge  economy.    These  routine  jobs  are  essential  but  unheralded  in  the  new   economy.    Jobs  such  as  data  processing  and  routine  clerical  work  involve  managing      11  

  
quantities  of  information  in  highly  supervised  environments  rather  than  employing   knowledge  creatively.  Such  jobs  have  little  likelihood  of  promotion  and  long  shifts  that   entail  close  work  at  the  computer  or  on  phones.    Many  of  these  jobs  are  filled  by   women1,  and  working  class  immigrant  women  are  well  represented  in  these  numbers.  In   the  case  of  this  study,  half  of  the  women  are  immigrants  from  south-east  Asia,   specifically  the  Philippines  and  Indonesia.        Much  has  been  written  about  the  emergence  of  the  new  class  of  knowledge   workers  who  have  quickly  become  the  privileged  class  in  the  office.  They  are  seen  as  the   primary  asset  of  businesses  and  are  wooed  with  benefits  and  cutting  edge   communications  technology.  This  compensates  for  the  shrinking  desk  space  they  are   assigned  in  office  environments,  as  offices  now  represent  a  microcosm  of  the  space  of   flows.  Professional  knowledge  workers  are  increasingly  mobile  and  unfettered  by   routine.  They  are  encouraged  to  work  on  the  move  and  are  available  to  their  employers   24  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a  week.  They  parallel  the  mobility  of  professions  that  can   transmigrate  between  centres  of  finance.  Office  space  designed  for  the  knowledge   worker  allows  for  a  variety  of  informal  places  for  meetings  and  gathering.  Knowledge   work  is  supported  by  in-house  cafes  and  the  latest  technologies,  space  is  provided  for   the  development  of  creative  ideas  or  quiet  work  on  projects  that  require  focus.  The   knowledge  worker  may  have  a  dedicated  desk  but  often  will  independently  determine   their  preferred  location  for  productive  work.  They  can  shift  their  place  of  work  to  suit   the  task  at  hand  and  take  full  advantage  of  opportunities  that  arise.  They  are  the  rich  of   the  office.      The  poor  of  the  office  are  the  routine  clerical  workers,  mostly  women  and  often   immigrants.  The  spaces  of  their  work  are  most  often  dedicated  cubicles  where  they   spend  their  shifts.    They  are  held  captive  in  a  hegemonic  system  that  keeps  them   performing  routine  work  with  little  prospect  of  promotion.    At  Investors  Group  the   routine  clerical  workers  have  little  independence  of  operation.  Their  work  is  centred  on                                                                                                                           
1  Nearly  60%  of  clerical  jobs  in  the  finance  industry  are  occupied  by  women  including  financial  institutions   and  insurance  companies.(World  Economic  Forum,  "The  Corporate  Gender  Gap  Report  2010.")

the  hard-wired  screens,  on  their  desks,  hours  are  logged,  and  the  lunchroom  and   meeting  rooms  are  too  small  to  provide  alternative  places  for  work.    Most  desks  are   without  a  telephone  if  their  work  does  not  require  one,  and  the  policy  of  the   organization  discourages  personal  calls  during  working  hours,  effectively  closing  off  the   outside  world.  The  offices  were  constructed  and  occupied  in  1987  and  the  women's   ways  of  working  in  the  space  has  not  changed  significantly  since  then.    The  close  space   of  the  desk  becomes  the  primary  location  for  routine  workers  to  express  their  values,   priorities  and  individuality.  Personalia  collected  at  the  desk  provides  a  source  of  control   for  the  women  occupying  dedicated  clerical  desks.  It  allows  for  the  constant  stream  of   work  to  be  limited  by  desk  cleaning  rituals  and  time  spent  in  social  networking.      The  nature  of  an  organization  is  demonstrated  in  the  construction  of  space,  but   space  also  reveals  underlying  priorities  and  the  values  of  the  users  and  designers  of  the   space.  The  spatial  turn  which  is  evident  in  recent  theoretical  work  from  anthropology   and  sociology  focuses  mainly  on  cities,  economies  and  globalization  in  the  work  of  Soja   (1996),  Harvey  (2000,  2001),  and  Castells  (2000)  who  build  on  the  early  spatial  writing  of   Lefebvre  (1991),  Foucault  (1977),  and  Benjamin  (1968,1999).      Working  as  a  genealogist  of  power,  Michel  Foucault  (1977)  positions  the   organization  of  space  as  the  diagram  or  signifier  of  systems  of  power  inherent  in   institutions  such  as  hospitals,  schools  and  prisons.  An  example  he  develops  is  the  spatial   serialization  of  the  classroom  that  has  evolved  from  the  relationship  of  the  Master  and   his  pupil.  Students  were  ranked  and  categorized  by  knowledge,  behaviour  and  social   status  and  accordingly  allocated  a  position  in  the  spatial  order   by  assigning  individual  places  it  made  possible  the  supervision  of  each  individual   and  the  simultaneous  work  of  all.  It  organized  a  new  economy  of  the  time  of   apprenticeship.  It  made  the  educational  space  function  like  a  learning  machine,   but  also  as  a  machine  for  supervising,  hierarchizing,  rewarding.     (Foucault  1995:  147).     Foucault's  project  in  Discipline  and  Punish  brought  attention  to  the  shaping  of   human  subjects  from  without  to  create  compliant  and  docile  minds  and  bodies.   Hierarchy  and  rank  have  provided  the  hegemonic  structure  of  the  organization  in  the   20th  century.  The  design  and  allocation  of  space  in  the  office  has  been  carefully      13  

  
orchestrated  to  provide  rewards  in  the  form  of  individual  spatial  assignments  such  as,   levels  of  privacy,  location  with  relation  to  access  to  windows  and  natural  light,  and   amount  and  quality  of  furniture  provided,  aligned  with  ranking  and  status.   Walter  Benjamin  was  aligned  with  the  Frankfurt  School  but  drew  references   variously  from  Marxism,  Surrealism  and  Zionism.  2  His  unfinished  work  The  Arcades   Project  (1999)  has  posthumously  established  him  as  a  contemporary  philosopher  of  the   spatial.  He  understood  the  significance  of  the  introduction  of  iron  into  the  framing  of   social  space,  writing  about  the  phenomena  of  the  arcades  of  Paris.    These  vaulted  iron   and  glass  structures  connected  department  stores  and  shops  retailing  textiles,  creating   palaces  of  consumption.  They  provided  entertainment  for  the  masses  and  were  popular   with  tourists.  Entertainment  became  intrinsically  connected  to  the  idea  of  consumption,   and  was  made  more  accessible  and  acceptable  for  the  working  classes.    Through  The   Arcades  Project  Benjamin  brings  attention  to  the  intrinsic  connection  of  the  social   existence  of  human  beings  and  their  spatial  condition.    His  method  is  original  and   instructive,  using  a  bricolage  of  commentary,  citations,  images,  poetry  and  newspaper   reportage,  variegated  traces  of  daily  life    (1968)  as  the  vehicle  of  a  new  spatial  medium   to  consider  the  historical  period  politically,  socially  and  aesthetically.   Henri  Lefebvre,  French  sociologist  and  philosopher,  is  arguably  the  most   influential  of  the  contemporary  spatial  theorists.  His  work  has  been  widely  sourced  for   the  development  of  the  discipline  of  human  geography3.  It  is  interdisciplinary  in  nature   and  has  currency  in  design  theory  in  planning,  environmental,  and  architecture.   Lefebvre's  writing  begins  from  Marxist  understandings  of  the  structure  of  society  but   expands  beyond  to  look  at  the  formation  of  urban  space  as  the  reproduction  of  the   social  relations  of  capitalist  production.    Aronowitz  (1991)  asserts  that  "for    Lefebvre     everyday  life  is  the  site  of  and  the  crucial  condition  for  the  `reproduction  of  the  relations   of  production'..[his]  central  argument  is  that  state  and  economy  are  outcomes  of  the   everyday"  (135).

As  such  Lefebvre  rejected  the  constraints  of  the  classical  Marxist  position  of  the  base/   superstructure  model.    He  argues  the  significance  of  the  everyday  is  the  outcome  of  a   century  of  conflict  where  capitalism  has  survived  revolution.     Lefebvre's  The  Production  of  Space  (translated  in  1991)  was  the  first  philosophical  work   to  closely  examine  the  significance  of  spatial  and  social  practices  as  central  to   understanding  the  production  and  reproduction  of  everyday  space.  "Space  is  social   morphology:  it  is  to  lived  experience  what  form  itself  is  to  the  living  organism,  and  just   as  intimately  bound  up  with  function  and  structure"  (Lefebvre  1991:94).   Lefebvre  developed  a  trialectic  approach  to  thought  that  valued  not  only  history  and   sociality  but  also  emphasized  spatiality  as  a  way  of  understanding  lived  experience.  He   elaborated  a  method  for  analysing  space  that  considers  the  perceived  space  of  everyday   life,  the  conceived  space  of  architects,  planners  and  developers  and  the  lived  space  of   dreams  and  possibility,  accessed  through  art  and  culture.  Lefebvre's  theory  of  the  social   production  of  space  provides  a  starting  point  for  understanding  the  dialectical   relationship  between  the  office  workers  and  the  space  that  both  constrains  and  enables   them.  In  The  Production  of  Space  (1991  [1974])  Lefebvre  brings  spatial  considerations  to   the  forefront  of  the  philosophical  realm  and  develops  a  framework  for  the  study  of   spatial  practices  where  "the  reproduction  of  social  relations  is  predominant"  (1991:50).   Lefebvre  theorizes  about  the  three  distinct  and  yet  interrelated  elements  as  the  causal   components  of  space.          He  understands  the  conceived  as  the  result  of  formalized  design  processes   determined  by  planners,  architects  and  technocratic  agencies.    The  perceived  is  the   space  that  is  produced  and  reproduced  through  everyday  social  interaction  and   experience.  The  meanings  we  give  to  space  and  the  reordering  of  that  space  to  reflect   and  reinforce  those  meanings  is  the  lived.  This  third  space  of  clandestine  and  alternative   practices  has  informed  the  work  of  geographer  and  cultural  theorist,  Edward  Soja.        For  Soja  third  space  implies  a  decentering,  disruption  and  disordering  of  all  forms   of  binary  thinking.  Lefebvre's  approach  opens  a  third  space  of  political  choice,  a  meeting   place  for  others.  Soja  develops  Lefebvre's  argument  for  difference,  complexity  and      15  

  
diversity,  against  the  specific  geography  of  capitalism  defined  through  the  increasing   forces  of  homogenization,  fragmentation  and  hierarchy.  "At  its  best  such  critical  spatial   thinking  seeks  to  undermine  it's  own  authority  by  a  form  of  textual  and  political  practice   that  privileges  uncertainties,  rejects  authoritative  and  paradigmatic  structures  that   suggest  permanence  or  inviolability,  invites  contestation,  and  thereby  keeps  open  the   spatial  debate  to  new  and  different  possibilities"  Soja  (1996:  107).      Soja  situates  race  and  gender  in  the  third  space  perspective  through  the  work  of   bell  hooks  and  Dolores  Hayden  among  others.  "Urban  spatiality  was  seen  as   oppressively  gendered  in  much  the  same  way  that  the  cityscape  was  shown  to  be   structured  by  the  exploitative  class  relations  of  capitalism  and  the  discriminatory   geographical  effects  of  racism,  the  two  other  major  channels  of  radical  modernist  urban   critique  developing  over  the  same  period  in  the  spatial  disciplines"(Hayden  1984,  110).   This  is  useful  to  consider  because  it  assumes  there  is  space  for  the  other,  allowing  for   the  insertion  of  a  gendered  and  racially  aware  discourse.        Part  of  the  project  of  Lefebvre's  The  Production  of  Space  (1991),  was  the  Marxist   analysis  of  the  rational  cartesian  space  of  modernism.  Lefebvre  questioned  the  erasure   of  diversity  and  difference  demonstrated  in  architecturally  conceived  environments   confiscated  from  nature  and  typified  by  space  as  a  set  of  things/signs  and  their  formal   relationships.  He  describes  abstract  space  as  the  dominant  form  of  contemporary  space,   housing  amongst  other  things,  the  institutions  of  knowledge,  power  and  wealth,  and   exercising  a  negating  and  repressive  force  on  those  who  occupy  it.  History  is  reduced  to   memory  or  weak  symbolism  in  abstract  space.  Abstract  space  positively  enforces  the   technological,  scientific  and  knowledge  bound  to  power.    David  Harvey  (2000,  2001),  a   Marxist  geographer  and  theorist,  also  took  up  Lefebvre's  urban  spatial  theories.  He   elaborated  their  economic  and  symbolic  dimensions  to  address  social  injustice  and   challenge  capitalist  space.  The  tactics  of  workers  in  the  office  represent  an  example  of   the  complexity  and  contradiction  Lefebvre  associates  with  abstract  space.  Office   workers  do  militate  but  in  largely  subversive  and  ad-hoc  ways,  to  produce  the  space   they  need  for  the  work  they  are  responsible  for  doing.  By  studying  the  personalia  at      16  

  
women's  desks  the  dissertation  demonstrates  the  subtle  ways  that  workers  can  militate   against  the  totalizing  aspects  of  abstract  space.      Susan  Halford,    co-director  of  the  Work  Futures  Research  Centre    at  the   University  of  Sussex,    argues  that  spatiality  has  been  omitted  from  the  sociology  of  work     research.  In  her  essay  Sociology  of  Space,  Work  and  Organization  (2008),  she  sets  out  to   demonstrate  the  need  for  a  greater  focus  on  spatiality  to  create  a  new  sociology  of   work.  She  neglects  to  notice  the  designers  of  workspaces  have  something  to  contribute   to  this  discourse  asserting  that  geographers  are  the  rightful  and  recognized  experts   when  it  comes  to  spatial  theorizing.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  human  geographers  were   early  advocates  to  challenge  the  neutrality  of  space  and  time  in  the  construction  of   social  theory  and  research  methods.    Doreen  Massey's  work  Spatial  Divisions  of  Labour   (1984)  generated  a  new  and  productive  cross-disciplinary  dialogue  between   urban/economic/social  geographers  and  sociologists.    She  demonstrated  that  the   complexity  of  spatial  divisions  historically  imposed  on  different  forms  of  labour  would   affect  regional  inequities  and  economic  potential.  Massey  also  wrote  on  the  gendering   of  spatial  divisions,  a  topic  developed  further  in  Daphne  Spain's  writing  particularly   Gendered  Spaces  (1992),  and  Hanson  and  Pratt's  Gender,  Work  and  Space  (1995).   Although  their  work  rarely  steps  inside  the  spaces  to  understand  more  than  the  spatial   plan,  their  work  is  more  quantitative  in  nature  and  they  look  to  draw  conclusions  rather   than  focus  on  the  embodied  and  messy  everyday  understandings  of  spatial  occupation.   "These  "ways  of  operating"  constitute  the  innumerable  practices  by  means  of  which   users  reappropriate  the  space  organized  by  techniques  of  sociocultural  production"  (de   Certeau  1984:  xiv  ­xv).        We  can  see  a  more  embedded  and  embodied  understanding  in  the   phenomenological  sociology  of  de  Certeau,  Giard  and  Mayol's  The  Practice  of  Everyday   Life  Volume  2  (19984)  where  the  rituals  of  living  and  cooking  are  uncovered  and   examined.    It  is  this  approach  that  provides  a  model  for  the  case  studies  in  this   dissertation.    They  form  a  window  into  the  complex  and  messy  lives  lived  in  office

environments,  the  place  where  the  designers  plan  (conceived  space)  and  the  workers   experience  (perceived  space)  meet  in  the  space  of  dreams  and  possibilities  (lived  space).   "Enter  any  work  organisation  and  we  are,  necessarily,  engaged  in  complex  spatialities:   engaged  with  the  meanings,  materialities  and  bodily  performances  embedded  in  and   produced  by  these  organisations  of  space  and  spatialities  of  work"(Halford  2008:  927).   The  study  of  personalia  using  ethnographic  methods  uncovers  complex  spatialities  that   span  personal,  inter  and  intrarelationships.    They  represent  personal  and  group   identities,  histories  and  dreams.   Designers'  role      Design  is  a  developmental  process  which  John  Zeisel,  sociologist,  architect  and   author,  in  his  seminal  text  Inquiry  by  Design  (1981,  1984,  2006)  depicts  as  comprising   three  complex  and  interwoven  activities  ­  imaging,  presenting  and  testing.    The  design   process  is  iterative  and  cyclical  with  information  and  critical  input  feeding  into  the   design  outcome.  The  design  process  for  interior  design  is  grounded  in  detailed   information  collected  from  the  client  and  case  studies,  with  presentations  to  clients  and   consultants  feeding  back  and  requiring  iterative  adjustments.      The  process  for  the  design  of  an  office  involves  extensive  consultation  with  the   client  before  the  design  process  can  begin.  This  takes  many  different  forms  but  usually   engages  with  a  high  percentage  of  the  office  constituency  to  understand  the  operations   and  needs  of  the  organization  at  the  detail  level.  In  1985  Investors  Group  engaged  the   workplace  furniture  manufacturer  Steelcase,  to  carry  out  a  rigorous  and  large  survey  of   the  equipment  required  for  all  those  employees  likely  to  move  into  their  new   headquarters.  Typical  office  configurations  for  each  level  of  the  organization  were   developed  as  a  result.  This  information  assisted  the  organization  to  move  from  a  very   hierarchical  departmental  structure  to  one  based  on  flatter  hierarchies  and  standardized   office  sizes.  The  typical  office  layouts,  along  with  the  management  philosophy  and   vision,  informed  the  planning  of  the  floors.  Workstations  for  work  groups  in  the  open   office  areas  were  planned  in  greater  detail  by  the  office  furniture  supplier.

   In  the  1980s  the  executive  floors  and  public  areas  of  the  building  received  much   greater  attention  from  the  designers  with  the  open  planned  areas  often  being   developed  by  furniture  suppliers  or  office  juniors,  as  was  the  situation  at  Investors   Group5.  Design  budgets  focussed  on  the  development  of  the  executive  areas,  public   areas  and  management  offices  as  this  represented  the  identity  of  the  corporation  to   clients  and  employees.    The  design  process  in  the  1980's  prioritized  the  front  of  house   space,  rendering  the  back  of  house  spaces  where  the  clerical  workers  were  located  as   less  visible  and  less  valued.          Research  Questions  :  Space  of  Identity.      The  desk  provides  the  space  of  identity  for  those  workers  who  are  denied  the   technologies  of  mobility  that  facilitate  different  opportunities  for  the  expression  of   identity.    This  study  addresses  the  desks  of  routine  clerical  workers  who  are  women  and   often  immigrants.    For  these  women,  work  is  a  necessity,  not  always  a  pleasure,  and  can   be  seen  as  part  of  the  eddy  of  workers  who  do  not  enjoy  the  privileges  of  mobility  or  the   relative  freedom  of  knowledge  workers.    The  question  this  dissertation  seeks  to   understand  is  how  does  the  physical  environment  of  the  workplace,  the  desk,  and  its   personalia  reflect  the  creation  of  women's  identities  and  values  in  response  to  the   hegemony  of  the  financial  services  industry?      The  office  workplace  evolved  rapidly  in  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century  with   the  impact  of  technology,  globalization  and  the  increasing  democratization  of  work.   Women's  participation  rates  (Kanter  1977:26)  have  grown  from  being  a  small  minority   in  the  1900s  to  approximately  75.5  per  cent  of  the  administrative  and  clerical  workforce   in  the  20096.    How  does  the  workplace  reflect  women's  values,  and  how  have  women's   values  influenced  the  design  of  the  workplace?      Research  methods  include  narratives  of  the  women  as  phenomenological  case   studies  based  on  semistructured  interviews  using  photo-elicitation.    These  methods                                                                                                                    5  Leonie  Glenat  personal  communication.

align  with  the  valuing  of  ordinary  voices  and  personalia  that  might  provide  richer  and   more  complex  instruments  for  understanding  the  office  environment  than  is  usually   employed.  The  thesis  does  not  seek  to  produce  a  normative  behavioural  study  or     extrapolate  generalizations  but  rather  to  propose  a  series  of  individual  case  studies  that   build  on  theories  from  feminism  and  material  culture  by  reflecting  the  voices  and   practices  of  the  women  routine  workers.  The  material  of  the  research  is  illuminating  and   diverse  and  the  methods  seek  to  reflect  that.      Standpoint  Theory  and  "Women's  Ways  of  Knowing"      To  be  able  to  discuss  and  analyze  the  research  findings  it  is  important  to  have  a   theoretical  frame  through  which  to  view  the  women'  s  narratives.  "Women's  ways  of   knowing"  allowed  me  to  understand  what  might  be  a  representation  of  women's  values   and  modes  of  operation.  Based  on  feminist  research  carried  out  on  a  very  diverse  group   of  research  subjects  Belenky  et  al.  provides  me  with  a  language  to  discuss  women's   identity  and  concerns.      The  women's  suffrage  movements  of  the  late  19th  century  are  generally  regarded   as  the  first  wave  of  feminism.  They  focused  on  legal  obstacles  to  women's  rights  such  as   the  right  to  vote,  own  property,  employment  rights,  equality  in  marriage,  and  the  right   to  hold  positions  of  political  power  and  authority.    Second  wave  feminism  grew  out  of   the  women's  liberation  movements  in  1960s  and  1970s  and  built  on  the  achievements   of  the  suffrage  movement.  Feminism  in  this  period  addressed  sexuality,  reproductive   rights,  women's  roles,  labour  in  the  home  and  patriarchy.    It  was  critical,  as  Women's   Studies  departments  were  established  in  universities,  that  women  had  authoritative   texts  written  by  women  addressing  issues  of  importance  to  women.      One  such  text  was  written  by  a  group  of  sociologists  -  Mary  Field  Belenky,  Blythe   Mcvicker  Clinchy,  Nancy  Rule  Goldberger  and  Jill  Mattuck  Tarule  (1986)  who  researched   the  epistemology  or  "ways  of  knowing"  of  135  rural  and  urban  women,  aged  16  to  60,   from  diverse  racial,  economic  and  educational  backgrounds  with  a  focus  on  identity  and   intellectual  development.  Their  work  was  grounded  in  the  research  of  William  Perry      20  

  
(1970)  whose  conclusions  were  based  on  all  male  students  from  Harvard  University.   Belenky  et  al.'s  findings  were  significantly  more  far-reaching  and  gender-related.  They   developed  five  "ways  of  knowing"  or  knowledge  perspectives,  dependant  on   conceptions  of  self,  relationships  with  others,  and  understanding  the  origins  and  identity   of  authority,  truth  and  knowledge.  (Belenky  et  al.1986)  "Women's  ways  of  knowing"  as   interpreted  by  Karen  Franck  (1989)  provides  a  framework  for  the  analysis  of  identity  and   how  it  might  be  reproduced  in  the  spaces  of  office  workers,  as  discussed  in  the  case   studies  in  Chapter  Six.    Chapter  Four  will  expand  on  feminist  standpoint  theory  and   "women's  ways  of  knowing"  (see  pages  76  -  78).      Methodologies  for  the  Everyday        This  dissertation  draws  on  a  number  of  research  methods  in  an  attempt  to  intuit   subtle  and  divergent  meaning  from  the  ephemeral  traces  of  occupation  in  the  spaces  of   routine  work.  It  uses  methodologies  of  the  everyday  inspired  by  Michel  de  Certeau's   (1998)  sociological  studies  of  French  working-class  culture,  such  as  ways  of  living  and   cooking.    De  Certeau,  a  theologian  and  historian,  was  interested  in  theorizing  everyday   operations  that  make  use  of  the  cultural  products  of  modern  society.  Cultural  products   have  trajectories  that  are  determinable  but  often  unsuspected,"sketching  a  theory  of   everyday  practices  in  order  to  bring  out  their  murmuring     the  `ways  of  operating'  that,   as  a  majority  in  social  life,  often  only  figure  as  `resistances'  or  as  apathies  in  relation  to   the  development  of  sociocultural  production"  (de  Certeau,  Giard  and  Mayol  1998:xx).      Giard  (1998)  explains  in  her  introduction  to  The  Practice  of  Everyday  Life:  Volume   2  Living  and  Cooking  that  de  Certeau  saw  the  insinuation  of  tactics  of  resistance  where   others  only  saw  obedience  and  standardization.  He  believed  in  the  intelligence  and   inventiveness  of  powerless  people  who  use  tactical  nimbleness  in  the  face  of  the   strategies  of  power.  His  desire  was  to  refute  the  thesis  of  passive  consumers  and  mass   behaviour.    Interviews  were  used  as  a  way  of  giving  the  floor  to  ordinary  people  but   required  a  particular  quality  of  empathy  from  the  interviewer.  Giard's  significant   contribution  to  de  Certeau's  work  is  seen  in  The  Practice  of  Everyday  Life:  Volume  2      21  

  
where  her  feminist  influence  led  to  research  on  cooking,  a  place  where  women's   practices  could  be  considered  (1998:  xxviii).      When  I  first  came  across  The  Practice  of  Everyday  Life  the  work  resonated  with   my  own  observations  about  the  ways  in  which  office  workers  operated  in  spaces  owned   by  the  organization  and  assigned  to  them.  The  personalia  at  the  desks  always  seemed  to   be  more  than  the  creation  of  a  "sense  of  oneself"  (Csikszentmihalyi  and  Rochberg-   Halton  1981)  or  a  way  of  symbolically  representing  identities  to  others  (Sundstrom  and   Sundstrom  1986).  The  seeming  randomness  of  the  objects  and  the  subversion  of   everyday  office  supplies  suggested  something  else  was  at  work.        Phenomenological  Research  Approach      Phenomenological  inquiry  is  often  categorized  as  "qualitative  inquiry"  or   `'grounded  theory"  or  "theory  grounded  in  the  empirical  world".  Phenomenology   examines  the  kinds  of  symbols  and  understandings  within  a  group  that  give  meaning  to   a  way  of  living  and  experiencing,  and  as  such  is  well  suited  to  unpacking  the  micro   culture  of  the  office  environment.       Heidegger  asserted  that  our  relationship  to  the  world  is  neither  "idealist"  (acts  on  the   world)  nor  "realist"  (world  acts  on  her)  but  rather  we  are  caught  up  in  the  world  and   immersed  in  an  "undissolvable  unity"  (Stewart  &  Mickunas,  1990).  Heidegger  called  this   "dasein"  or  "being-in-the-world".    Because  of  this  indivisibility  the  major  challenge  is  to   avoid  subject/object  dichotomies.        Phenomenology's  response  is  towards   "intentionality"  where  human  experience  and  consciousness  necessarily  involve  some   aspect  of  the  world  as  their  object,  which  reciprocally  provides  the  context  for  the   meaning  of  experience  and  consciousness  (Seamon,  1980:  4).      Phenomenology  became  central  to  Continental  philosophy  throughout  the  20th   century,  launched  by  Edmund  Husserl,  Martin  Heidegger,  Maurice  Merleau-Ponty,  

and  Jean-Paul  Sartre  in  the  first  half  of  the  century.  Beginning  with  Edmund  Husserl's  
concept  of  transcendental  philosophy,  invariant  structures  of  consciousness  underlying   human  experience  are  able  to  be  identified  through  phenomenology.    Husserl  specifies      22  

  
that  "logical  concepts  ...  must  have  their  origin  in  intuition:  they  must  arise  out  of   ideational  intuition  founded  on  certain  experiences,  and  must  admit  of  indefinite   reconfirmation"  (1970b,  pp.  251-252).  His  emphasis  on  imagination,  ideas,  and  essences   give  the  human  sciences  their  distinctive  character.   Merleau-Ponty  and  Heidegger  reacted  to  the  notion  of  structures  of  consciousness.   Heidegger  reinterpreted  the  structures  to  be  categories  of  human  experience  rather   than  pure  cerebral  consciousness,  establishing  an  existential  correction  (1962  [1927]).     Merleau-Ponty  sought  to  question  the  mind-body  convention  common  in  western   philosophy  at  this  time.  He  moved  from  cerebral  structures  to  lived  experience,   embodying  phenomenology  (1962  [1945]).  The  goal  is  "a  rigorous  description  of  human   life  as  it  is  lived  and  reflected  upon  in  all  of  its  first-person  concreteness,  urgency,  and   ambiguity"    (Pollio  et  al.1997:5).  It  is  the  move  to  value  lived  experience  that  places  the   dissertation  case  study  research  into  a  phenomenological  framework.  In   phenomenological  studies  the  investigator  refrains  from  making  suppositions,  focusing   on  a  topic  with  fresh  eyes,  constructing    questions  to  guide  the  study,  and  deriving   findings  that  will  provide  the  basis  for  further  research  and  reflection.  
  

  

De  Certeau's  sociological  method  was  influenced  by  Henri  Lefebvre's  writing  on  

the  social  construction  of  space  and  shares  the  language  of  spatial  practices.    In  the   context  of  the  office  we  could  understand  the  trialectic  as  the  conceived  representing   the  formal  organizing  plans  and  drawings  that  instruct  the  creation  of  the  office  and  is   constructed  by  the  interior  designer  or  space  planner.  The  office  workers  who  occupy   and  experience  the  spatial  configuration  and  its  environmental  ramifications  are   represented  by  the  perceived;  and  the  lived  is  the  location  of  individual  identities  and   dreams  in  the  spaces  of  work,  resisting  the  constant  movement  of  people  and  their   locations  within  the  corporation.  Lefebvre's  trialectic  makes  room  for  the  average   person  to  exercise  personal  resistance  to  enable  transformation,  countering  the   oppressions  of  everyday  life.    "Lefebvre's  emphasis  on  the  oppressions  of  everyday  life   are  countered  by  a  transcendent  belief  that  everyday  life  cannot  be  contained  by      23  

  
bureaucratic  regimentation,  that  it  harbours  the  desire  that  generates  transformation.   Nature,  love,  simple  domestic  pleasures,  celebrations,  and  holidays  all  erode  any   prospect"  (McLeod  in  Harris  &  Berke  1997:15).      Phenomenological  approaches  to  research  inquiry  have  significance  for  this  topic   because  they  allow  for  the  "bodily,  visceral,  intuitive,  emotional  and  transpersonal   dimensions"  (Seamon  n.d.:4)  of  the  women  office  workers  to  be  acknowledged  and   legitimized.      Everyday  life  challenges  reductive  categories  such  as  public  and  private,   work  and  leisure,  routine  and  escape  allowing  the  analysis  to  move  beyond  these   dichotomies.  We  get  another  kind  of  knowledge  from  intuitively  `becoming  one  with'   the  subject  and  therefore  participative  kinds  of  methodologies  are  relevant  to  this   inquiry.  Harmon  (1994)  suggests  "we  learn  about  reality  by  identifying  with  the   observed"        Following  the  reflective  process,  the  researcher  constructs  a  full  description  of   his  or  her  conscious  experience.  This  is  called  a  textural  description  and  includes   thoughts,  feelings,  examples,  ideas,  situations  that  portray  what  comprises  an   experience.  In  the  dissertation  the  narratives  and  visual  composites  were  a  way  of   constructing  a  depiction  of  the  everyday  of  each  woman,  a  distillation  of  the  essence  of   our  interview.    The  perception  and  interpretation  of  the  women's  narratives  together   with  the  images  allowed  me  to  reflect  upon  and  develop  essences  and  meaning  from   the  everyday  of  the  women  clerical  workers.      Eliciting  Ethnography  Through  Images      Visual  research  methods  are  various  and  diverse.  Some  researchers  have  used   visual  material  to  make  theoretical  arguments  which  are  only  available  through  image- based  methodologies,  while  others  have  used  visual  material  in  ways  that  are  essentially   illustrative.    The  photograph  can  be  a  faithful  record  of  a  space  or  an  interior,  or  it  can   be  an  artefact  to  be  interpreted  and  read  much  like  a  painting.  Photography  was  first   used  at  the  turn  of  the  20th  century,  and  was  linked  to  sociology  as  both  practices   explored  and  documented  society.  Images  were  discarded  in  1916,  as  North  American      24  

  
sociology,  concerned  with  appearing  more  scientific,  moved  away  from  "manipulated   prints,  iconographic  poses,  inconsistent  before-and-after  photographs,  portraits  out  of   context,  and  images  based  on  clumsy  techniques"  (Statz,  1979:  128).  However  interest   in  visual  research  was  revived  in  the  1960s.     "Photographs  are  forms  of  data  which  the  researcher  has  obtained  with  their  camera,  as   opposed  to  administering  a  survey  or  conducting  an  interview"  (Emmison  and  Smith,   2000:  24).    The  photographic  record  allows  for  research  data  that  is  too  fleeting  or   complicated  to  be  captured  and  described  in  writing.    The  reflexive  mode  of  the  use  of   photography  as  described  by  Douglas  Harper  involves  the  subject  in  the  definition  of   meaning.    "In  the  reflexive  mode  the  sociologist  actively  involves  the  research  subjects   in  the  interpretation  of  images  ...a  process  referred  to  as  `photo-elicitation'"  (Emmison   and  Smith,  2000:  29).    Jenkings,  Woodward  and  Winter  (2015)  assert  that  "with  respect   to  photo  elicitation,  we  need  to  recognize  that  the  photograph  is  not  simply  a  source  of   information,  of  details  that  can  be  read  by  the  informant.  Rather,  it  is  part  of  a   collaborative  interaction  between  the  interviewer  and  interviewee  in  the  production  of   analysis  and  data."   Photo  elicitation  has  been  acknowledged  to  be  especially  useful  when  interviewing   children  where  traditional  verbal  interviewing  techniques  are  seen  as  potentially   limiting,  even  exclusionary  (Epstein,  Stevens,  Mckeever  &  Baruchel,  2006).  Collier  (1979)   suggests  the  use  of  photographs  makes  the  research  subject  into  a  co-researcher  and   can  bridge  between  strangers,  facilitating  communication  that  may  lead  to  "unfamiliar,   unforeseen  environments  and  subjects"        In  developing  the  research  method  I  intuitively  and  imaginatively  developed  a   research  area  that  responds  to  my  own  experiences  and  observations  as  a  workplace   designer  and  student  of  office  environments.    The  area  of  personalization  of  the   workspace  is  generally  understudied  although  it  more  recently  has  become  an  area  of   academic  interest  eg    Brandes  and  Erlhoff  (2011),  Byron  and  Laurence  (2014),  Wells  and   Thelan  (2002)  and  Elsbach  (2004).

I  searched  for  research  methods  that  would  allow  me  to  "become  one  with  the   subject",  to  study  the  micro-  environment  of  women  in  the  office.  The  method  I   employed  was  photo  elicitation.    The  benefits  of  the  photographs  were  such  that  at  the   interview  stage  they  allowed  the  women  to  reflect  on  the  contents  of  their  spaces  as   valued  and  authentic.    They  also  allowed  for  visceral  responses  with  expressions  of  the   emotional  history  and  content  of  the  desktop  personalia.      Emmison  and  Smith  describe  photographs  as  secondary  to  the  in-depth   interviews;  however  my  own  experience  with  photo-elicitation  suggested  that  the   photographs  provide  invaluable  spatial  information  such  as  the  location  and  visibility  of   personalia  at  the  desk  that  reflects  unconscious  choices  made  by  the  subjects.  This  type   of  information  would  not  have  been  uncovered  by  the  interviews.  The  main  component   of  my  research  involved  making  photographic  images  of  the  close  working  environment   of  routine  clerical  workers  in  the  financial  services  industry,  associated  with  60-minute   interviews  with  the  11  women  workers  who  were  located  in  two  departments.  Chapter   Five  combines  the  narratives  and  visual  composites  of  each  woman's  workspace.  The   interviews,  the  photographs  and  my  field  notes  were  used  to  reflexively  interpret  the   artefacts  of  personal  occupation  found  on  the  workers  desks.  The  result  of  my  analysis   are  in  Chapter  Six.  The  framework  for  the  analysis  was  developed  from  the  content  of   the  photo-elicitation  research  and  its  theoretical  underpinnings.  The  benefits  of  the   photographs  were  such  that  at  the  interview  stage  they  allowed  the  women  to  reflect   on  the  contents  of  their  spaces  as  valued  and  authentic.    They  also  allowed  for  visceral   responses  with  expressions  of  the  emotional  history  and  content  of  the  desk  top   personalia.    The  photographs  allowed  for  my  continued  reflection  on  the  subjects  values   and  the  nature  of  the  small  objects  and  spatial  practices  at  the  desk.    They  allowed  for  a   richer  reading  and  interpretation  of  the  interviews  and  the  images.   In  his  text  Inquiry  by  Design  John  Zeisel  (2006)  discusses  the  benefits  of   observing  and  photographing  physical  traces  to  determine  how  the  physical   environment  meets  the  needs  of  its  users.  He  suggests  observing  physical  traces   requires  systemic  looking  for  traces  of  previous  activity  that  was  produced      26  

  
"unselfconsciously"  or  consciously  as  a  response  to  the  physical  environment.    This   method  of  reading  the  physical  environment  is  used  frequently  by  designers  to  intuit   patterns  of  use;  however,  when  the  reading  is  performed  systematically  the  meanings   that  might  be  extrapolated  are  more  complex  and  interesting  from  the  perspective  of   the  researcher.  Zeisel  talks  about  these  as  "rich  impressions"  that  may  be  "highly   Illustrative",  but  they  do  need  to  be  balanced  by  questions  about  what  is  missing  from   the  picture.   Zeisel  (2007:161)  advises  that  the  benefits  of  this  research  method  are  a  source   of  provocative  images  that  deal  with  long-lasting  phenomena;  however,  he  warns   against  drawing  superficial  hypotheses  without  further  investigation.  In  response  to  this   concern  I  chose  to  used  photo-elicitation,  as  discussed  previously,  to  actively  involve  the   research  subjects  in  the  interpretation  of  my  photographs  of  their  close  work   environments.  The  images  enabled  interview  subjects  to  discuss  more  directly  the   values  implicit  in  personalia  at  their  desks.        The  value  of  the  ethnographic  research  to  this  project  is  that  it  facilitates  the   interpretation  of  artefacts  through  the  flow  of  social  discourse  that  often  reveals  more   about  context  and  cultural  environment.  According  to  anthropologist  Clifford  Geertz   (1973),)  ethnographic  research  attempts  to  fix  the  [artefact]  ephemera  of  the  work   environment,  to  allow  deeper  analysis  and  enable  and  legitimize  the  study  of  the   "homely  and  microscopic".      Material  Culture  of  the  Everyday      The  study  of  material  culture  has  expanded  from  anthropology  to  embrace  the   physical  object  as  a  site  for  historical  study  that  does  not  rely  on  the  written  word;  its   use  is  particularly  evident  in  American  studies.    Material  culture  eschews  any  single   methodology  seeking  instead  to  "develop  the  explanatory  power  of  artefact  knowledge   in  order  that  such  knowledge  might  ultimately  expand  human  understanding"  (Schlereth   1985:7).

The  study  of  material  culture  is  interdisciplinary  drawing  on  and  contributing  to  studies   in  art,  architecture,  decorative  arts,  cultural  geography,  history  of  technology,  cultural   anthropology,  culture  and  social  history.    It  is  able  to  address  three-dimensional  spatial   understanding  that  is  often  salient  to  the  objects  themselves.  Schereth  (1985:12)  lays   claim  to  a  special  sensory  knowledge  that  is  derivable  from  the  study  of  material   culture;  it  is  a  non  rational  effective  knowledge  that  works  with  our  tactile  senses  to   ground  our  experiences  beyond  the  abstract  symbolic  uses  of  language.      The  relevance  of  material  culture  research  to  the  project  of  studying  the   everyday  is  significant,  as  demonstrated  in  the  work  of  Daniel  Miller  (2008),  British   anthropologist  and  author.  He  has  studied  clothing,  the  home,  media  and  the  car   amongst  other  things,  to  understand  our  relationship  to  objects  in  contemporary  society   and  the  complex  role  that  consumption  plays  in  human  emotions.  The  attributes  of   spatial  inclusion,  interdisciplinarity,  sensory  knowledge  and  relevance  to  the  everyday   make  material  culture  research  an  obvious  choice  for  understanding  the  tactics  of  the   everyday  in  the  office.  The  objects  that  are  the  focus  of  the  dissertation  project  are  the   personalia  that  accumulates  on  the  desks  and  pin  boards  of  women  workers  in   conjunction  with  their  spatial  practices.    We  cannot  study  these  close  spaces  of   habitation  in  a  historical  context  as  the  building  was  first  occupied  in  1987.  Because   personalia  is  ephemeral  and  previously  disregarded  as  insignificant,  it  remains   unrecorded.    The  dissertation  uses  current  employees'  workstations  to  understand   women's  spaces  produced  in  the  open  office  areas  of  Investors  Group.    As  discussed   previously  the  workstations  were  photographed  by  the  author  to  capture  a  moment  in   time,  and  provide  a  place  from  which  the  "unseen"  can  be  observed  as  if  for  the  first   time.  The  images  were  used  as  data  and  an  "aide  de  memoire"  as  I  interviewed  the   women  regarding  the  value  and  meaning  of  their  experiences  at  their  desks.  In  this   research  each  subject  becomes  an  individual  case  study  or  portrait  7  of   phenomenological  ethnography,  focusing  the  research  on  the  individual  and  the   embodied  experience  of  that  individual  in  the  close  environment  of  the  office.                                                                                                                    7  Daniel  Miller  uses  this  term  in  his  2008  book  "The  Comfort  of  Things."     28     

  
   In  her  essay  "Intimacy  and  Objects",  Beverly  Gordon  (1997)  makes  the  argument   that  women  are  more  comfortable  than  men  in  proximate,  personal  situations  where   involvement,  texture  and  detail  are  relevant.  She  suggests  this  is  due  to  divergent   socialization,  working  from  Hall's  "Hidden  Dimension"(1966).    She  relates  this  thesis  to   women's  traditional  forms  of  art  making  that  she  describes  as  "small  delicate  and   typically  representational,  and  either  made  of  soft  materials  or  built  up  with  soft  forms   and  colours"  (Gordon  1997:239).    Gordon's  thesis,  while  controversial,  provides   interesting  validation  for  the  significance  of  women's  use  of  personalia  as  a   representation  of  their  values  and  identity.    These  gestures  are  small,  detailed  and   textured,  such  as  Molly's  focus  on  her  proximate  pinup  space.  The  detail  of  the  tiny   christening  ornament,  and  the  colourful  patchwork  ceramic  plate  extolling  her  to  "live   well,  laugh  often,  love  much"  and  her  professional  mantra,  the  5S's,  provide  comfort   and  connection  to  Molly's  personal  world  from  her  location  at  the  desk.    The  personalia   at  the  desk  often  has  no  value  other  than  its  social  context,  inviting  us  to  see  these   expressions  as  Lefebvre's  lived  space  embodied.        Additional  research  involved  surveying  the  internal  publications  of  Investors   Group  from  1960  onwards  and  obtaining  plans  of  One  Canada  Place.  I  spent  time  in  the   archives  of  Investors  Group  where  I  found  historical  photographs  and  publicity  material   that  helped  to  reconstruct  the  character  and  culture  of  the  organization  (see  Chapter   Three).  I  photographed  Investors  Groups'  head  offices  extensively  (discussed  in  Chapter   Four  and  images  in  Appendix  Two).  I  interviewed  the  senior  management  of  the   organization  from  1987  including  CEO  Dick  Archer;  Chairman  Art  Mauro;  Facilities   Manager  Neil  McMillan;  Winnipeg  Core  Initiative  board  member  Jim  August;  principal  of   Rice  Brydone  Interior  Design  Group  Eleanor  Brydone;  and  the  designer  who  lead  the   project  for  Rice  Brydone  Anita  Jones.  I  also  had  a  number  of  interviews  with  local   interior  designers  Leone  Glenat  and  Gail  Tyshynski  who  worked  for  Insite,  the  furniture   contractor  on  the  project.          The  following  chapter  addresses  the  history  of  the  workplace  from  the   perspective  of  women  and  spatial  environments  that  supported  office  work.  It  analyzes      29  

  
the  management  theory  that  has  determined  the  nature  of  the  physical  space  for  office   work,  looking  at  the  shift  from  hierarchical  disciplined  organizations  inspired  by   Taylorism  to  flatter  management  structures  that  support  teams,  collaborative  working   and  different  forms  of  supervision  and  production  resulting  from  neoliberalism  and   globalization.

   CHAPTER  TWO    

   WOMEN,  OFFICE  WORK  AND  INTERIOR  DESIGN     
The  radical  shift  in  the  gender  of  office  workers  over  the  20th  century  has  generally   been  ignored  by  mainstream  organizational  theorists  (Mills  1953;  Handy  1989;  Drucker   1993)  and  workplace  design  critics  (Becker  &  Steele  1995;  Duffy  1982,1992;  Myerson  &   Turner  1998).  This  dissertation  addresses  the  growing  numbers  of  women  entering  the   white-collar  workforce  in  the  period  between  1960  and  1990;  and  the  simultaneous   growth  of  the  female-dominated  interior  design  profession  that  was  substantially   responsible  for  designing  workplaces  during  this  time.          Additionally,  the  academic  writing  addressing  gendered  space  generally  focuses   on  domestic  interiors  (Attfield  and  Kirkham  1989,  Sparke  1995),  public  space  (Wilson   2000,  Sparke  2008)  and  spaces  of  consumption  (Chaney  1983,  Friedberg  1993)  with  the   examination  of  workplaces  limited  to  gender  segregated  workplaces,  such  as  the   garment  industry  (Hanson  and  Pratt  1995).  The  dissertation  brings  attention  to  office   work  as  gendered  space.        I  am  interested  in  the  influence  of  women  on  the  essentially  masculine  nature  of   the  office  and  its  design.  I  argue  that  the  outcome  of  the  shift  in  gender  and   management  philosophies  supported  by  the  emerging  influence  of  the  newly- professionalized  interior  designer  resulted  in  an  office  environment  that  became  more   closely  aligned  with  women's  preferred  ways  of  working,  but  that  the  routine  office   workers  have  yet  to  benefit  substantially  from  new  working  environments.              I  look  at  the  years  prior  to  1960  to  establish  the  character  of  offices  leading  up   to  World  War  II  and  then  the  five  decades  up  until  1990.    My  dissertation  draws  on   Lefebvre's  (1991)  thesis  of  the  socio-spatial  dialect  that  creates  and  recreates  the  spaces   we  occupy.  The  women  workers  can  be  seen  as  operating  in  Lefebvre's  differential      31  

  
space  where  surreptitious  change  occurs  as  the  result  of  workers'  accumulated  actions;   and  the  architects  and  interior  designers  working  at  the  level  of  conceived  space.      

   HISTORY  OF  THE  MODERN  OFFICE  
   The  physical  form  of  the  modern  office  of  the  20th  century  is  the  product  of   shifting  management  theories.  Placing  the  plan  of  the  physical  layout  of  the  office  under   closer  scrutiny,  we  can  observe  the  priorities  and  values  of  the  organization  and  the   image  of  the  organization  being  established  or  reinforced  by  the  furniture  and  office   locations  (Sundstrom  1986:  9-10).  The  modern  office  was  first  conceived  of  in  the  early   1920s  in  response  to  the  management  theory  that  revolutionized  the  manufacturing   industry,  and  a  rapidly  growing  class  of  white-collar  workers.  Fredrick  Winslow  Taylor's   1911  Principles  of  Scientific  Management,  proposed  the  careful  study  and  definition  of   work  tasks  leading  to  the  restructuring  of  work  practices.  Granath  asserts  that  the  key   principle  of  Taylorism  was  "that  each  task  in  a  given  production  process  should  be   defined  and  performed  according  to  empirically  founded  knowledge  and  methods,  not   simply  rules  of  thumb"  (1991:  111).      Taylors'  Principles  became  widely  accepted  globally  as  industrialization  spread.   They  advocated  for  shorter  working  hours,  breaks  in  work,  paid  holidays  and  an   improved  physical  environment;  in  return,  the  workers  carried  out  strictly  defined  tasks   according  to  instructions,  without  the  ability  to  improvise  or  refine  the  process.  The   intellectual  component  of  the  work  was  externalized  and  administered  by  supervisors   and  managers.  The  management  principles  required  that  the  plan  of  the  office  also   needed  to  change  to  provide  for  greater  supervision  and  managerial  oversight.  The   modern  office  was  to  be  a  demonstration  of  Taylorist  principles,  with  clearly  defined   tasks  supervised  and  managed  in  a  hierarchical  structure,  with  the  knowledge  and   power  residing  at  the  top  of  the  organization.    Taylorism  was  evident  in  office  planning   from  the  `20s  on,  with  businesses  prior  to  that  typically  modelled  on  a  large  house  with   a  series  of  rectangular  rooms  strung  along  corridors.

   New  administrative  practices  and  systems  were  created,  first  in  banks  and  then   were  spread  to  other  organizations;  "issues  such  as  labour  recruitment,  disciplined  work   schedules,  cost  reckoning,  and  the  seeking  of  customers  were  addressed,  and  the   solutions  built  into  systems"  (Kanter  1977:  19).  The  aggregation  of  previously   externalized  functions  under  the  control  of  management  characterized  this  period.  Also,   independent  contractors  inside  the  company  with  the  power  to  hire  and  fire  were   replaced  with  central  personnel  departments  and  centralized  administration.          Professional  Managers      Feminist  sociologist  Rosabeth  Moss  Kanter  reviews  the  history  of  corporations,   noting  there  were  many  mergers  of  small  enterprises  that  occurred  in  the  period   between  1889  and  1929.  The  mergers  created  a  need  for  a  new  category  of  professional   managers  "to  take  charge  of  the  ongoing  function  of  corporations"  (Kanter  1977:  19).   Business  schools  were  slowly  established  at  American  universities,  with  the  Wharton   School  of  Finance  and  Commerce  being  the  first  in  1884.    Management  as  a  professional   field  for  men  was  established  with  the  Harvard  Business  School  in  1908,  with  a  doctoral   program  introduced  in  1922.    In  an  effort  to  establish  authority  for  this  new  profession,   an  ideology  of  rational  efficiency  was  promoted  that  justified  "the  unilateral  exercise  of   power  by  management"  (Moore  1962:  237).    Power  was  to  be  exercised  by  those  who   were  not  business  owners,  and  were  not  therefore  legitimized  by  money  or  class  but  by   education.      Kanter  asserts  the  origins  of  management  theory  were  infused  with  masculinized   and  paternalistic  values  that  established  the  centralization  of  management  control  in  a   hierarchical  structure  built  upon  titles  and  status  levels  and  were  implicitly  male  (Kanter   1977:  22).     The  growth  of  the  insurance  industry  and  establishment  of  mail  order  businesses   in  North  America  at  the  turn  of  the  20th  century  were  bolstered  by  the  adoption  of   communication  technologies  developed  in  the  previous  century,  such  as  the  telephone,   typewriter  and  telegraph.  The  adoption  of  the  typewriter  led  to  an  explosion  of  the      33  

  
clerical  sector  and  many  of  these  jobs  were  filled  by  women,  who  earned  less  than  half   the  wages  paid  to  men  (Spain  1992:  192).  "Between  1900  and  1920,  the  percentage  of   women  in  the  labour  force  who  were  clerical  workers  zoomed  from  2  ­  12  percent  "   (Kessler-Harris  1982:  148).          "Typewriter"  was  the  term  used  for  the  machine  and  the  women  who  operated   it.  The  early  adoption  of  the  typewriter  created  "an  entirely  new  attitude  to  the  written   and  printed  word"  because  it  "fuses  composition  and  publication"  (McLuhan  cited  in   Kittler  1999:  202).  Kittler  argues  that  phallocentric  pens  wielded  by  male  clerks  and   writers  in  the  19th  century  gave  way  to  the  fine  finger  skills  of  young  female  typewriters   and  irretrievably  feminized  work  with  words  at  the  turn  of  the  20th  century  (1999:  206).     What  women  lacked  in  education  in  math  and  writing  skills,  they  more  than  made  up  for   with  dexterity;  a  note  from  two  German  economists  in  1895  attributes  to  this  to  piano   lessons  (Kittler  1999:  194).      The  new  role  of  the  typewriter  in  the  office  led  to  the  establishment  of  standards   for  office  paper,  envelopes  and  files  that  stored  correspondence.  Desk  drawers  were   developed  for  the  filing  of  paper,  replacing  the  traditional  scrolled  letters  held  by  red   tape.        Systematic  approaches  to  organizational  management  and  office  planning   became  popular,  bringing  rational  scientific  notions  of  efficiency  and  highly  defined   skilled  and  unskilled  areas  of  work.    Supervision  became  a  priority  in  the  planning  of   office  space,  with  large  workrooms  familiar  from  industrial  production  laid  out  with   rows  of  desks  aligned  to  regularize  output  and  optimize  supervision  by  male  managers.     Furniture  also  evolved  in  this  period  to  suit  the  new  efficiencies  of  management   processes."The  modern  efficiency  desk  developed  in  1915  for  Equitable  Assurance   Company's  new  Manhattan  headquarters  was  pivotal  in  the  emergence  of  modern   office  culture.  Little  more  than  a  table  with  shallow  drawers,  this  new  desk  banished  the   privacy  previously  afforded  by  roll  top  desks  and  the  cabinet-like  Wooton  desk"   (Albrecht  and  Broikos  2000:  22).

The  efficiency  desk  allowed  easier  supervision  and  forced  workers  to  keep  office   correspondence  moving  rather  than  hidden  in  pigeonholes.  "Aligned  in  orderly  rows  the   Modern  Efficiency  Desk  symbolized  the  era's  obsession  with  factory-like  standardization   and  rational  science"  (Albrecht  and  Broikos  2000:  22).      The  Office  Building,  1930­1960      The  architecture  of  office  buildings  of  the  period  was  reminiscent  of  institutional   architecture  with  uniform  spaces  and  very  little  embellishment.    As  the  size  of  the   population  of  office  workers  increased,  the  need  for  a  new  building  form  became   apparent.    New  materials  technology  was  developed  to  efficiently  construct  multi-storey   buildings,  along  with  the  means  to  transport  people  efficiently  through  vertical  space  via   elevators.  In  the  1930s  electric  light  came  into  common  use  along  with  central   ventilation  systems,  allowing  for  a  larger  floor  plate  size  and  more  regular  hours  of   operation.      A  visionary  prototype  for  the  modern  office,  illustrated  in  American  management   handbooks  from  the  period,  was  the  Larkin  Building  (1904)  in  Buffalo,  designed  by  Frank   Lloyd  Wright  for  the  Larkin  Mail  Order  Company's  business.      The  building  was  designed   for  1,800  secretaries,  clerks  and  executives,  and  it  had  to  be  clean  and  comfortable  to   attract  women  employees  to  the  industrial  sector  of  the  city.  It  presented  a  stern  red   brick  façade  to  the  external  world,  but  opened  up  to  a  vast  atrium  at  the  core  of  the   architectural  plan  to  celebrate  Wright's  concern  for  "the  new  industrial  ideals"  and  was   lit  by  natural  light  filtered  through  a  glass  ceiling.  The  lintels  spanning  the  perimeter  of   the  interior  void  bore  inspirational  words  in  groups  of  three:  GENEROSITY ALTRUISM
SACRIFICE; INTEGRITY LOYALTY FIDELITY; IMAGINATION JUDGEMENT INITIATIVE; INTELLIGENCE ENTHUSIASM CONTROL; CO-OPERATION ECONOMY INDUSTRY.    

It  personified  the  "masculinized  and  paternalistic  values"  that  Kanter  refers  to,  but   nevertheless  provided  new  and  careful  consideration  of  the  employees'  well-being  and   health.      The  planning  of  the  departments  was  configured  as  follows:  the  mail  centre  and   entrance  lobby  were  located  on  the  first  floor,  overlooked  by  the  typewriting   35     

  
department  on  the  second  floor  and  the  mail  order  department  on  the  third  floor.  The   fourth  floor  housed  a  kitchen,  bakery  and  dining  rooms,  classrooms,  a  branch  of  the   Buffalo  Public  Lending  Library  and  a  conservatory.    A  rooftop  garden  served  as  a   recreation  area  for  employees  and  their  families.      Wright  wrote  in  his  autobiography,  "The  dignified  top-lighted  interior  created  

the  effect  of  one  great  official  family  at  work  in  day-lit,  clean  and  airy  quarters"  (Wright   1943:  150-51).   A  predominantly  female  workforce  informed  Frank  Lloyd  Wright's  designs  for  the   unprecedented  Larkin  Administration  Building  in  Buffalo,  New  York  (1906).   Conceived  as  the  headquarters  for  the  soap  company's  mail-order  business,  Larkin   was  the  first  office  building  to  integrate  innovations  in  architecture  with   progressive  management  philosophy,  mechanical  systems,  spatial  distribution  and   furniture.  Partly  to  attract  the  best  workers  (mostly  women)  and  partly  for  public   relations.    Wright  designed  a  clean,  light-filled  world  completely  separate  from  the   gritty  industrial  environment  around  it.  This  monument  to  the  progressive-era   ideal  of  uplifting  work,  designed  with  the  most  advanced  communications  and   distribution  systems,  also  provided  opportunities  for  employees'  self- improvement:  a  YWCA,  library  and  music  lounge.  (Albrecht  and  Broikos  2000:  21)      Although  the  Larkin  Building  was  hailed  by  business  texts  as  the  model  office,  

Wright  didn't  design  another  office  building  until  much  later  in  his  career  when  he  was   commissioned  to  design  the  headquarters  for  Johnson  Wax  in  Racine.  His  approach  to   office  design  came  from  a  concern  to  improve  the  working  conditions  of  the  average   man  and  woman,  and  he  introduced  innovations  such  as  the  wall  hung  toilet  pan  to   maintain  cleaner  washrooms,  stained  glass  windows  to  inspire  employees,  and  glass   doors  to  allow  as  much  light  as  possible  to  penetrate  the  building.  The  design  process   started  from  an  understanding  of  the  flow  of  work  through  the  company,  and  as  such   Wright  designed  buildings  that  fit  the  organizational  systems  that  were  evolving  at  this   time.            36  

  
Organizing  Systems:  Departments      The  new  business  office  developed  a  structure  of  departments  with  specific   functions  determined  by  classic  managerial  principles  and  informed  by  notions  of   efficiency.    Punctuality  and  synchronicity  were  paramount  and  led  to  the  creation  of   "bullpens"  or  large  open  halls  occupied  by  clerical  workers  performing  repetitive  and   routine  tasks  in  the  same  place  at  the  same  time.  Departments  were  laid  out  with   offices  for  the  managers.  Personal  secretaries  were  located  outside  the  offices,  serving   as  the  day-to-day  interface  with  the  new  technology  required  in  managerial  work,  such   as  typing  confidential  letters,  answering  the  telephone  and  placing  calls,  and  organizing   the  boss's  appointment  schedule.        The  first  secretarial  school  in  Providence,  Rhode  Island  -  the  Katherine  Gibbs   School  (established  in  1911)  -  prepared  "well  bred"  young  women  for  "elite  secretarial   jobs".  Women  were  not  only  taught  typing,  shorthand  and  personal  grooming  but   accounting  and  grammar,  allowing  Gibbs  girls  to  secure  better  jobs  (Kanter  1977:  27).   Their  education  responded  to  the  needs  of  the  male  executives  they  would  work  for.     Secretarial  work  was  divided  into  two  kinds:  The  elite  corps  of  private  secretaries   were  directly  attached  to  one  or  more  bosses  for  whom  they  did  a  variety  of  tasks   and  from  whom  they  derived  status.  Other  secretarial  work  was  done  in  steno  and   typing  pools  whose  occupants  were  little  more  than  extensions  of  their  machines   ­  and  highly  replaceable  at  that.    The  contrast  in  privileges,  rewards  and  status  of   these  two  types  of  work  enhanced  the  desirability  of  the  private  secretarial   position  making  it  seem  the  culmination  of  a  clerical  worker's  aspirations.   (Kanter  1977:  27)      Standards  of  dress  and  behaviour  in  the  office  were  implied  and  supervised.    

Male  clerks  expected  to  be  employed  for  life;  young  women  typewriter  operators  were   expected  to  leave  employment  when  they  became  engaged  to  be  married.  Workspace   was  assigned  based  on  status,  and  greater  personal  space  and  privacy  was  acquired  as   one  moved  up  the  hierarchy.  The  title  "manager"  provided  a  private  office.      Spain  asserts  that  women's  jobs  can  be  classified  as  "open  floor",  but  men's  jobs   are  more  likely  to  be  "closed  door"  ­  that  is,  women's  work  in  offices  was  being  carried   out  in  more  public  spaces  with  much  less  control  over  the  environment  than  men's      37  

  
work.  "This  lack  of  spatial  control  both  reflects  and  contributes  to  women's  lower   occupational  status  by  limiting  opportunities  for  the  transfer  of  knowledge  from  men  to   women"  (Spain  1992:  206).    She  explains  women  were  segregated  in  secretarial  pools   that  separated  them  from  the  decision-making  that  went  on  in  the  managerial  offices,   denying  them  the  opportunity  to  work  without  repeated  interruptions.    This  impacted   their  capacity  to  make  valuable  contributions  that  could  have  given  them  greater  status   and  better  pay.  The  physical  environment  of  the  office  conspired  to  keep  women  in   clerical  roles  with  very  little  capacity  for  taking  on  managerial  roles.            New  managerial  approaches  led  by  Elton  Mayo  were  being  explored  in  the  1930s   The  Human  Relations  Movement   at  Harvard  Business  School.    He  established  what  later  became  the  discipline  of  Human   Resources  Management.  Its  curriculum  and  research  was  based  on  applied  and   empirical  studies  drawing  on  multi-disciplinary  approaches  that  incorporated  biology,   biochemistry,  psychology,  sociology  and  anthropology.    The  human  relations  movement   attempted  to  shift  the  focus  of  research  into  organizations  to  include  social  relations,   workers'  motivation  and  satisfaction,  and  move  away  from  masculinized  and   paternalistic  values  inherent  with  the  centralization  of  management  control.      The  movement  worked  from  the  premise  that  people  are  motivated  by  social  as   well  as  economic  rewards.    Mayo  demonstrated  the  importance  of  emotional,  non- rational  social  relations  that  shaped  behaviour  and  influenced  productivity.  "In  Mayo's   view  workers  were  controlled  by  sentiment,  emotion,  and  social  instincts,  and  this   phenomenon  needed  to  be  understood  and  taken  into  account  in  organizational   functioning"  (Kanter  1977:  23).        The  longest  running  Hawthorne  experiment  involved  the  relocation  of  a  group  of   six  young  immigrant  women  to  a  separate  room  to  build  relay  assemblies.  The  women   responded  to  the  intimate  atmosphere  of  the  assembly  room  by  developing  friendships   over  time,  as  they  were  able  to  talk  while  they  worked.  Over  the  years  of  the   experiment,  the  women's  productivity  rose  significantly.    The  individuals  were  observed      38  

  
to  have  become  a  team.    "Mental  attitudes,  proper  supervision  and  informal  social   relationships  experienced  in  the  group  were  key  to  productivity  and  job  satisfaction"   (Anteby  and  Khurana  n.d.).  Mayo's  team  also  carried  out  well-known  research  that   accidentally  uncovered  the  Hawthorne  Effect, a  term  used  to  identify  any  type  of  short- lived  increase  in  productivity  caused  by  attention  from  researchers.    The  Hawthorne   study  focussed  on  the  effect  of  the  physical  environment  on  productivity,  including   increases  in  illumination  levels,  maintaining  clean  workstations,  clearing  floors  of   obstacles  and  relocating  workstations.  This  may  have  been  the  first  research  that  linked   the  importance  of  the  physical  environment  to  productivity  in  the  workplace.      Mary  Parker  Follett  was  a  social  worker,  management  consultant  and  pioneer  in   the  Human  Relations  Movement.  She  graduated  from  Radcliffe  College  in  1898.  Her   writing  over  the  first  three  decades  of  the  20th  century  informed  the  evolution  of  more   progressive  and  effective  management  strategies  that  reflected  the  creation  of   collective  goals  for  management  and  workers.  She  wrote  a  number  of  seminal  texts   advocating  integration,  the  non-coercive  sharing  of  power  based  on  the  use  of  her   concept  of  power  with,  rather  than  power  over.  She  is  credited  with  having  first  used   the  expression  "transformational  leadership".  Kanter  suggests  Parker  Follett's  expertise   and  interest  grew  from  her  experience  in  the  administration  of  social  welfare   organizations  as  local  networks,  where  many  women  were  able  to  develop  collaborative   managerial  skills  (1977:  23).  In  1926  Parker  Follett  moved  to  England  to  live  and  work,   consulting  with  the  League  of  Nations  and  the  International  Labor  Organization  in  1928.   She  was  largely  forgotten  in  the  United  States,  but  her  work  on  adult  learning  in   organizations  (1924)  continues  to  have  relevance  in  current  discourses  around  learning   organizations.    Parker  Follett  is  hailed  by  Peter  Drucker  as  the  prophet  of  management,   and  the  book  published  after  her  death  in  1933,  Dynamic  Administration  (1941),  was   rediscovered  in  Japan  in  the  1960s  and  was  highly  influential  in  the  restructuring  of   Japanese  businesses  to  incorporate  teamwork.      Kanter  suggests  the  human  relations  movement  brought  a  feminization  to  the   masculine  ethic  and  encouraged  new  forms  of  organization  to  emerge,  such  as  team-    39  

  
oriented  project  management  systems.    However,  the  masculine  ethic  of  the  rational   manager  "told  men  how  to  be  successful  as  men  in  the  new  organizational  worlds  of  the   twentieth  century"  (1977:  25).    "If  the  human  relations  school's  metaphor  was  the   `family'  rather  than  the  `machine'  of  classic  models,  the  organization  was  still  thought  to   require  a  rational  controller  at  its  head.    Writers  on  management  practice  and   organizational  theory  distinguished  between  the  manager's  logic  of  efficiency  and  the   worker's  logic  of  sentiment  "(1977:  24).  While  men  were  being  groomed  for  success  in   the  corporate  world,  women  were  employed  in  greater  numbers  to  play  the  supporting   roles  in  routine  office  work  and  secretarial  functions.      We  can  see  the  influence  of  the  human  relations  movement  on  the  built  form  of   the  office  in  a  subsequent  project  designed  by  Frank  Lloyd  Wright  for  his  client  Herbert   Johnson.    Constructed  from  1936-39  the  Johnson  Wax  Building  demonstrated  the  ideals   shared  by  Wright  and  Johnson  who  believed  in  a  new  industrial  democracy;  "inspired  by   Puritan  idealism,  social  conscience  and  moral  sentimentality"  (Frampton  in  Lipman   1986:  xi).  Frampton  depicts  this  as  a  belief    "that  Taylorized  production,  reduced   working  hours,  increased  welfare  and  benefits  (S.C.  Johnson  &  Son  was  an  early   American  firm  to  introduce  profit  sharing)  together  with  improved  environmental   conditions    could...overcome  the  contradictions  of  capitalism  and  inaugurate  a  new   golden  age"  (Frampton  in  Lipman  1986:  xii).          Johnson  Administrative  Building,  Racine      Wright's  innovation  in  the  design  of  the  administrative  building  (1939)  for  the   Johnson  Wax  Company  was  the  creation  of  a  community  of  workers,  isolated  from  the   urban  setting  in  which  they  were  located,  but  with  all  of  the  components  of  a  cultural   and  social  community;  the  project  housed  a  cinema  and  performance  space  that  seating   250,  and  squash  courts.  The  building  develops  many  of  Wright's  earlier  themes,   including  a  vast  central  workroom  lit  by  an  innovative  glass  tube  roof.      The  Great  Workroom  that  represented  the  central  hall  of  the  workplace  was   designed  to  create  a  greater  sense  of  co-operation  and  efficiency,  with  employees      40  

  
having  direct  access  to  one  another  (Lipman  1986:  94)  "Wright  laid  out  the  departments   to  promote  efficient  flow  of  information",  departments  were  co-located  for  improved   communications  with  a  central  filing  department  accessible  to  all,  located  under  the   south  mezzanine.  The  Great  Workroom,  "a  top-lit  hypostyle  hall"  supported  on  64  lily   pad  columns,  established  an  aesthetic  that  combined  the  feeling  of  being  in  a  forest  of   trees  and  within  an  ecclesiastic  space.    It  was  designed  as  the  workspace  for  the  female   clerical  workers  of  the  Johnson  Wax  Company,  while  the  floors  above  housed  the  men  in   managerial  positions.  The  offices  of  the  middle  managers  were  located  on  the   mezzanine,  and  the  penthouse  housed  the  senior  executives  and  boardroom.        True  to  Wright's  democratic  ideals,  the  furniture  developed  for  the  Great   Workroom  established  the  design  language  that  was  common  throughout  the   administration  building,  including  the  desk  and  chairs  in  Chief  Executive  Herbert   Johnson's  office.  A  system  of  furniture  designed  to  integrate  with  the  streamline  styling   of  the  building  derived  its  form  from  the  curvilinear  gestures  of  the  building  plan  and   the  strong  horizontal  lines  that  characterized  the  elevations.        Wright's  chair  design  for  Johnson  Wax  originally  had  only  three  legs,  supposedly   to  encourage  better  posture  (because  one  would  have  to  keep  both  feet  on  the  ground   at  all  times  to  sit  in  it).  The  chairs  had  foam  rubber  padding  and  were  colour  coded   based  on  the  department;  red  for  the  credit  department,  green  for  the  billing   department,  beige  for  sales  and  blue  for  the  branch  house  records  department.  The   chairs  were  adjustable  and  the  back  of  the  seat  pivoted  vertically  to  allow  a  greater   range  of  movement.  Chairs  for  the  Great  Workroom  were  scaled  down  for  the  women   using  them.      Tubular  steel  was  an  economic  choice  and  Wright  developed  a  number  of  desk   types  as  a  response  to  the  nature  of  the  work  being  performed.  The  desks  for  the   accounts  department  were  designed  so  heavy  ledger  trays  could  be  moved  from  the   master  filing  cabinet  in  a  small  rolling  stand  and  placed  in  hanging  bins  incorporated  into   the  desks  for  temporary  use.  The  desk  system  developed  was  simple  and  elegant;  the   images  represented  them  as  uncluttered  with  maple  work  surfaces  and  rounded  ends.      41  

  
They  were  light  and  quite  feminine  in  design.    The  desk  system  incorporated  nine   variations  according  to  task.          The  work  surfaces  were  much  larger  than  standard  desks  of  the  time  at   approximately  82"  X  32".  They  were  two  feet  longer  than  a  standard  desk,  more   generous  and  much  more  in  line  with  the  scale  of  desk  Frank  Lloyd  Wright  would  have   used  in  his  own  office  for  laying  out  drawings.    The  work  surfaces  of  the  desk  cantilever   over  the  frame  gave  maximum  workspace  clear  of  supports.    There  were  three  work   surfaces  provided;  the  lowest  for  a  typewriter,  the  middle  surface  was  the  writing  and   layout  surface,  and  the  top  provided  a  small  shelf  that  was  handy  storage  for  trays  and   files  and  gave  the  user  a  modicum  of  privacy.    The  dimensions  for  the  height  of  the  work   surfaces  most  likely  have  would  have  been  derived  from  the  Gilbreth's  work  (1921)  in   establishing  universal  human  dimensions  in  the  1920s.  The  walnut  timber  selected  for   the  work  surface  distinguished  executive  desks.        The  original  drawing  for  the  office  desk  and  chair  provided  to  Johnson  shows  the   desk  engaged  with  the  mushroom  column  stem.  This  feature  was  not  included  in  the   final  desk  design  but  spoke  to  Wright's  singular  vision  that  encompassed  building  and   furniture  in  one  gesture.    The  desk  in  its  original  form  included  pivoting  trays  for   storage,  a  file  drawer,  task  lighting  and  a  wastepaper  bin.  All  of  the  necessities  of   everyday  office  work  thoughtfully  integrated  into  a  complete  system  to  support   individual  workers,  but  no  consideration  was  given  to  personalia  at  the  desk  at  this  time.     Personal  items  such  as  family  portraits  were  appearing  on  executive  desks  but  were  not   thought  appropriate  for  other  employees  and  might  serve  as  a  distraction  from  the  work   in  hand.    The  women  clerical  workers  who  occupied  the  Great  Workroom  are  said  to   have  "enthusiastically  accepted  being  together  in  the  large  room"  (Lipman  1986:  94).      The  floor  plans  for  the  office  spaces  in  the  Larkin  Company  and  S.C.  Johnson  Wax   Company  demonstrate  the  typical  division  of  labour  between  the  "workers"  (mostly   women)  and  the  executives  (all  men).  However,  prototype  furniture  systems  that  were   developed  for  both  projects  brought  detailed  attention  to  desks,  chairs,  light  fittings,

office  landscaping,  and  the  upholstery  textiles  and  colours  that  considered  women  as   the  occupants  and  users  in  a  community  of  workers.      Frank  Lloyd  Wright's  design  philosophy  fits  best  into  a  movement  emanating   from  Europe  at  the  beginning  of  the  century  that  saw  the  interior  as  part  of  a   Gesamtkunstwerk,  a  "total  work  of  art",  in  which  the  interior  formed  an  integral  part  of   the  total  project.  The  movement's  goals,  as  described  by  Sparke,  "aimed  to  bring   together  architecture  and  the  decorative  arts  into  a  new  synthesis  that  would  not  only   facilitate  modern  life,  but  that  through  the  use  of  non-historicist  forms  inspired  by  the   contemporary  worlds  of  nature  and  the  machine,  would  actually  embody  it"  (Sparke   2008:  38).    Sparke  asserts  that  the  "new  interior"  that  developed  as  a  result  of  the   Gesamtkunstwerk  philosophy  merged  previously  separate,  public  and  private  spheres,   creating  a  new  spatial  vocabulary  with  women  as  its  growing  audience  in  the  developing   consumer  society  of  the  period.    Women  were,  however,  not  just  passive  consumers.     They  formed  a  major  component  of  the  evolving  class  of  "white-collar"  workers.8   Women  were  paid  less  than  the  men  and  filled  the  assistant  roles,  but  they  found  the   work  offered  better  pay  and  more  freedom  than  domestic  service  or  factory  jobs  (Mills   1951).      Women  performed  routine  office  work  in  the  new  jobs  created  when  men  left  to   enlist  and  fight  in  World  War  I.    "Finger  dexterity  is  often  more  important  than  creative   thinking.  Promotions  consequently  become  relatively  rare"  was  the  prevailing  attitude   expressed  by  The  War  Manpower  Commission  (cited  in  Mills  1951:205).      Wright's  Larkin  and  Johnson  Wax  buildings  are  exceptional  in  their  prescience.     They  exhibit  a  belief  in  the  potential  of  the  designed  environment  on  the  productivity   and  satisfaction  of  clerical  workers  who  were  mainly  women.    They  represent  unique   North  American  examples  of  the  possibilities  of  the  physical  environment  when  the   designer  and  corporation  work  towards  a  utopian  ideal.    We  can  criticize  them  today  for

Schlereth  (Victorian  America:  Transformations  In  Everyday  Life  1876-  1915     Harper  Perennial:  New  York  1992  P.  29)  noted,  members  of  this  new  urban  managerial  class  were  "active   participants  in  the  era's  revolutionary  changes  in  politics,  leisure,  education,  and  consumer  culture."

their  paternalistic  and  often  naïve  understanding  of  status  and  gendered  relations;   however,  the  Larkin  and  Johnson  administration  buildings  remain  examples  of  uniquely   humane  office  environments,  where  the  workers  and  employers'  needs  were   considered  significantly  in  the  design  process.  Wright  is  often  hailed  as  the  most   significant  architect  of  the  20th  century.  However,  architectural  historians  when   discussing  his  influence  often  overlook  the  design  of  his  office  buildings.  This  may  be   due  to  the  sheer  volume  of  innovative  projects  Wright  designed,  or  because  corporate   architecture  in  North  America  subsequently  followed  a  very  different  path  influenced  by   the  European  Modernist  architects.      The  Influence  Of  European  Modernism      European  interest  in  the  work  of  Frank  Lloyd  Wright  led  to  the  German   publication  in  1911  of  two  portfolios  titled  Studies  and  Executed  Buildings  of  Frank  Lloyd   Wright.  According  to  Mauro  F.  Guillen,  the  European  architects  were  the  first  to   understand  the  significance  of  the  industrial  era  and  the  possibilities  of  new  materials   such  as  steel  and  concrete.    Architects  in  Continental  Europe  in  the  early  1900s  "actively   advocated  and  planned  for  a  transformation  of  society.    The  emerging  modernist   architecture  (movement)  in  Europe  stood  out  in  strong  contrast  to  American   architecture,  in  that  it  was  avant-garde  ...it  was  revolutionary,  that  is,  moving  at  the   forefront  of  social  and  economic  change  rather  than  following  it  "  (Guillen  2006:  9).   Beginning  with  Peter  Behrens  in  the  1900s  and  culminating  at  the  Bauhaus  in  Germany   the  1920s,  the  European  architects  of  the  period  embraced  Taylorism  and  its  call  for   order  through  the  systematic  application  of  method,  standardization  and  planning,   embracing  the  idea  of  "technology  as  a  social  arbiter"  (Maier  1970).  New  technology   was  to  create  social  change  and  the  projects  that  were  the  focus  of  Bauhaus  architects   tended  to  be  affordable  social  housing.  Hitler  closed  the  Bauhaus  School  in  1933  and  its   teachers  dispersed.  As  a  result  the  Modernist  movement  didn't  have  a  great  impact  on   office  design  in  Europe.  It  did,  however,  influence  the  development  of  the  North   American  office  tower.    As  former  Bauhauslers,  such  as  Mies  Van  der  Rohe  and  Walter      44  

  
Gropius,  immigrated  to  America  to  escape  persecution  they  established  themselves  in   the  American  architectural  scene.    The  tenants  of  the  Bauhaus  School  and  its   preoccupation  with  a  rational  machine  aesthetic  were  soon  evident  in  the  post-war   building  boom  of  the  1950s  and  1960s  in  the  cities  of  America.      Modernist  buildings  from  the  post-war  period  were  designed  on  a  structural  grid   to  frame  large  open  interior  spaces  with  access  to  views  and  natural  light,  afforded  by   areas  of  glass  curtain  wall.    Acoustic  ceiling  tiles  recreated  the  modular  building  grid  in   the  interior  with  lighting  and  air  conditioning  integrated  into  them.    The  interior  was  laid   out  with  the  executive  offices  against  the  perimeter  window  walls,  often  framed  in   timber  panelling  that  excluded  light  from  the  central  secretarial  and  clerical  pools,  and   reinforcing  the  hierarchical  and  gendered  structure  of  the  corporation.      Office  Planning      "In  the  beginning,  office  buildings  were  desperately  in  need  of  interior  design.  

For  the  most  part,  purchasing  agents  just  ordered  desks  and  chairs  with  little  thought  of   planning.    My  background  as  an  architect  directed  my  efforts  towards  space  planning,  a   little  known  profession  not  yet  practised  in  the  40's"(Bassett  cited  in  Iorio  1994).        Knoll  Associates  Incorporated,  established  in  1946,  was  the  product  of  the  

marriage  of  Hans  Knoll,  a  furniture  manufacturer,  and  Florence  Schust  (Knoll  Bassett).   Florence  Knoll  Bassett  was  educated  as  an  architect,  beginning  at  the  Cranbrook   Academy,  then  studying  at  the  Architectural  Association  in  London,  and  then  the  Illinois   Institute  of  Technology  where  she  studied  with  former  Bauhausler  Mies  Van  Der  Rohe.     She  credits  Van  Der  Rohe  with  having  "a  profound  effect  on  my  design  approach  and  the   clarification  of  design."  "As  the  director  of  the  Knoll  Planning  Unit,  Bassett  established   herself  as  one  of  the  most  important  and  influential  interior  planners  and  designers  of   the  second  half  of  the  twentieth  century.  Believing  that  intelligent  design  "strikes  at  the   root  of  living  requirements  and  changing  habits,"  she  established  the  practice  of      45  

  
working  closely  with  the  corporate  sector  to  determine  the  needs  of  the  people  who   would  actually  use  the  spaces  that  her  company  designed  "(Iorio  1994).        Florence  Knoll  Bassett  embodied  Sparke's  thesis  of  "the  new  interior"  drawing  on   technological  innovation,  mass-produced  product,  and  the  synthesis  of  art,  architecture   and  decoration  to  facilitate  and  celebrate  modern  life.      The  office  building  of  this  period  is  parodied  in  the  office  set  for  the  television   series  Mad  Men  (2007-15).  The  story  is  located  in  an  advertising  agency  on  Madison   Avenue  in  New  York,  and  the  exterior  of  the  building  is  a  composite  of  existing  office   towers.    The  series  has  been  a  critical  success  due  in  large  part  to  a  generous  budget   that  has  allowed  for  high  production  values  and  an  evolving  office  set  that  has  captured   the  detail  of  the  period  from  the  early  to  late  1960s.    Richard  Williams  suggests:"...  it  is   the  interior  that  stays  in  the  memory,  describing  with  marvellous  clarity  the   complexities,  subtleties,  and  sexual  politics  of  the  modern  open  plan  office"  (2013:  101).      The  office  is  the  location  of  much  of  the  action,  the  primary  zone  being  the  open   office  area.  The  open  plan  is  a  public  zone  occupied  exclusively  by  female  secretaries   and  reception  staff.    The  typing  pool  is  uniform  and  beige,  framed  by  a  continuous   dropped  ceiling  with  gridded  fluorescent  lighting;  the  women  provide  the  only  colour   here.  The  private  zone  is  comprised  of  individual  offices  occupied  exclusively  by  male   senior  executives.  Their  offices  face  the  street  and  the  public  world  but  are  separated   from  the  open  plan  by  solid  walls  of  timber  panelling,  interspersed  with  opaque  glazed   panels.  Female  secretaries  protect  the  zone  in  between;  "whose  principle  task  is  to  limit   as  far  as  possible  contact  between  the  two  zones"  (Williams  2013:  101).  The  executive   offices  exude  masculinity,  symbolized  by  large  and  dominant  desks,  the  drinks  cabinet   and  constant  smoking.  The  colour  palette  is  rich,  with  timber  and  drapes  providing   texture,  and  accent  furniture  in  strong  solid  colours.  Windows  onto  the  downtown   emphasize  the  importance  of  these  men  as  players  in  New  York's  sophisticated  urban   scene.  There  are  softer  furnishings,  such  as  chairs  that  allow  for  the  sitter  to  be   comfortable  and  relaxed.  But  at  the  same  time  authoritative,  abstract  works  of  art   decorate  the  walls,  offices  are  softly  lit  with  lighting  to  accentuate  the  individual,  and      46  

  
framed  by  the  backdrop  of  the  city  (Williams  2013:  103).    The  contrast  between  the   women's  workspace  and  the  men's  emphasizes  the  value  of  the  men,  as  individuals  set   apart  from  the  organizational  space  occupied  by  the  women.  Personalization  of  the   work  area  was  limited  to  the  executive  offices,  with  a  now  mandatory  photograph  of  the   wife  and  family,  and  a  trophy  recognizing  sporting  achievements.  The  women's  desks  in   linear  rows  with  the  typewriter  in  the  same  place  on  each  desk  suggest  the  women  are   powerless  and  replaceable.    The  script  unfolds  another  story  with  strong  female  lead   characters,  but  we  witness  their  constant  struggle  with  the  need  to  accommodate  the   entitled  and  sexist  behaviour  of  the  men.        The  modern  open  office  plan  in  the  1950s  and  '60s  delineated  gender   boundaries  by  providing  men  with  symbols  of  status  and  careers  to  aspire  to,  while   women  were  seen  to  be  marking  time  on  their  way  to  a  good  marriage  and  children.      The  Schnelle  brothers  developed  the  earliest  example  of  open  office  planning  in   West  Germany,  post-World  War  II.  They  were  office  furniture  manufacturers  in   Quickborner,  Hamburg  with  an  interest  in  developing  greater  communication  between   supervisors  and  workers  with  less  emphasis  on  status  and  authority  (Sundstrom  1986:   36).  Known  as  the  Quickborner  Team,  they  developed  the  radical  status-free  style  of   planning  referred  to  as  burolandschaft  (office  landscaping)  that  was  adopted  by  large   German  corporations  such  as  Osram,  Krupp,  Boehringer,  Ninoflex  and  Mercedes  Benz  in   response  to  European  socialism  and  the  growth  of  the  influence  of  workers'  unions   (Brooker  2013:  59).        Burolandschaft  was  characterized  by  layouts  with  few  offices,  free-flowing   circulation  paths  and  the  organic  placement  of  light  moveable  desks  and  chairs;  screens   defined  work  and  relaxation  areas.  Wall-to-wall  carpet  created  visual  continuity  and  the   use  of  mobile  screens  provided  acoustic  remediation.  The  only  spaces  defined  by  walls   were  the  offices  for  the  executives  and  conference  room.    The  movement  reflected  the   desire  to  democratize  management  and  placed  value  on  the  individual  worker.    It   represented  a  break  away  from  planning  based  on  the  linear  organization  of  tasks,  to  a   layout  based  upon  studies  of  the  interrelationships  of  individuals  and  teams.    The      47  

  
intrinsic  problems  of  acoustic  and  visual  exposure  were  dealt  with  by  generous  personal   space  allocations  that  were  eroded  away  by  later  enthusiasts  of  this  approach  to   planning.    The  open  landscape  concept  required  a  commitment  from  management  to  a   non-hierarchical  organizational  structure  that  was  a  radical  departure  for  the  North   American  corporation.  In  North  America,  despite  attempts  to  develop  this  approach  to   planning,  most  organizations  were  too  inherently  hierarchical  in  their  management   structure  to  be  able  to  employ  the  new  office  landscaping  principles  to  great  advantage.   The  approach,  however,  offered  a  challenge  to  conventional  planning  principles  and   inspired  the  language  of  the  open  office  plan.  A  number  of  panel-based  office  furniture   systems  emerged  in  response  to  the  idea  of  greater  flexibility,  which  led  to  the  design  of   the  cubical  workstation  satirized  in  the  Dilbert  cartoons.    With  the  upholstered  panel   came  the  first  opportunity  for  those  in  the  open  office  to  claim  personal  space.      The  Speculative  Skyscraper      The  development  of  the  corporate  office  building  took  a  different  form  in  Europe   from  the  type  of  development  that  became  the  norm  in  North  America.  In  Europe  office   buildings  continued  to  be  designed  by  architects  for  the  specific  needs  of  particular   organizations.  In  North  America  the  model  of  the  speculative  skyscraper  became  an   efficient  and  cost-effective  model  for  corporations.  Office  space  constructed  by   developers  was  leased  rather  than  owned,  and  as  a  result  the  buildings  and  interior   spaces  were  more  generic  in  character  and  generally  architecturally  conservative.      The  fit-out  of  offices  was  commissioned  separately  from  the  architecture  of  the   building.  This  was  most  often  handled  by  an  interior  designer  or  interior  design  team  in   an  architects'  practice  to  tailor  the  office  to  meet  the  specific  needs  of  the  organization.       As  the  typology  of  "office  tenancy  fit-out"  emerged,  a  greater  number  of  professional   interior  design  teams  and  practices  sprang  up  to  meet  the  need.    By  1982  Graf  Klein  is   advocating  employing  a  design  professional  to  those  organizations  considering  new   office  space.    She  suggests  they  can  offer  a  range  of  services  in  the  planning  phases  that   make  their  advice  invaluable  such  as:  comparing  rented  spaces  "to  determine  suitability      48  

  
and  relative  cost  including  construction  or  renovation",  analyzing  existing  operations   and  establishing  space  standards,  and  analyzing  different  strategies  for  "buying,   building,  or  leasing  space"  (1982:  238).      Planning  Principles      In  the  I970s  furniture  companies  embraced  the  language  of  the  open  plan  office   and  promoted  it  as  the  answer  to  the  problems  of  rapid  change  in  the  nature  of   business.  Based  on  furniture  systems  rather  than  solid  partition  walls,  individuals  and   groups  could  be  relocated  or  expanded  as  required.    The  principles  being  promoted  by   firms  such  as  Steelcase  used  multiple  planning  concepts  (all  furniture-based  solutions)   such  as  the  open  office  landscape  and  panel-based  workspaces:  a  concept  where  desks   and  storage  elements  could  be  attached  to  privacy  panels  to  divide  up  spaces.        The  individual  worker  was  now  seen  more  frequently  as  a  business  asset  and   became  the  subject  of  research  and  literature  on  productivity  and  effectiveness  in  the   office.    Workstations  designed  for  specific  tasks  and  specific  users  were  advocated,  and   required  user  need  evaluations  and  the  establishment  of  space  standards  for  roles  and   tasks.  The  furniture  companies  promoted  the  specification  of  furniture  and  equipment   that  was  conducive  to  change.  New  panel-based  systems  made  effective  use  of  vertical   space,  creating  the  argument  for  higher  panels  to  divide  workspaces  so  overhead   storage  and  lighting  could  be  incorporated  (here  come  the  cubicles).          James  E.  Rappaport  suggests,  "that  `systems'  will  expand  to  include   prefabricated  components  that  will  include  all  mechanical  services.  Ceiling  tiles,   complete  with  sprinkler  lines  and  air  handling  ducts;  moveable  full  height  walls  that   include  storage  units;  raised  floor  systems  deliver  air  and  power  to  workstations;  as  well   as  work  stations  themselves  are  the  next  step"  with  the  expectation  that  organizations   will  take  their  systems  with  them  when  they  move  buildings  (Graf  Klein  1982:  43).      This   vision  of  a  totally  integrated  customized  system  has  not  been  realized,  although  aspects   of  the  vision  such  as  raised,  serviced  floors  are  in  common  usage  today.

   In  the  1970s  the  growth  of  businesses  accelerated,  generated  by  the  shortened   life  cycle  of  products  and  the  number  of  new  products  being  introduced  to  the  market.   The  exponential  growth  created  the  need  for  more  agile  and  flexible  organizations  to   accommodate  changing  technology  and  business  methods.   Employees  were  also  changing,  as  they  were  better  educated.  "The  bulk  of  office   workers  of  the  future  may  no  longer  be  young  ladies  marking  time  between  high  school   and  marriage.  They  may  be  instead,  intelligent,  aggressive  male  and  female  junior   executives  on  their  way  up  the  corporate  ladder,"  Steelcase  suggested  in  their  1974   publication  Planning  Principles  for  Effective  Office  Interiors.    Changing  management   attitudes  were  increasingly  informed  by  psychology,  and  the  development  of  fields  such   as  environmental  psychology  and  human  relations.  Second  wave  feminism  had   broadened  the  debate  to  include  workplace  inequality,  reproductive  rights  and  families.      Due  to  greater  competition  profit  margins  declined,  and  businesses  responded   by  looking  more  closely  at  the  cost  of  their  operations.  They  wanted  to  make  employees   more  efficient,  and  developed  a  greater  awareness  of  the  cost  of  physical  space  and  the   need  for  space  to  accommodate  change.  A  style  of  planning  developed  in  North  America   in  the  1970s  and  1980s  using  a  hierarchy  of  cellular  office  sizes  related  to  job  titles.  The   offices  were  arranged  around  the  perimeter  window  walls  with  a  combination  of   bullpen  and  open  plan  workstations  internally.  The  degree  of  privacy  available  for   employees  was  directly  related  to  rank  and  status,  but  if  the  organization  did  not  object   workers  were  now  able  to  make  space  for  their  outside  world  to  be  represented  by   artefacts  and  images  scaled  down  to  suit  the  size  of  their  cubicle.          THE  DECLINE  OF  ORGANIZATIONAL  HIERARCHY      The  mass  production  of  the  typewriter  and  the  introduction  of  the  telegraph  and   telephone  changed  the  nature  of  office  work  by  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,   separating  the  more  mechanical  tasks  from  the  intellectual  processes.  In  the  same  way   computers,  the  worldwide  web,  email,  cell  phones  and  integrated  technology  in  the  

  

50  

  
latter  part  of  the  20th  century  have  enabled  the  unrestricted  flow  of  information,   increasing  the  ability  of  organizations  to  work  more  fluidly  and  flexibly.      Peter  Drucker,  American  management  consultant,  educator  and  author,  wrote   The  Landmarks  of  Tomorrow  (1957),  identifying  the  emergence  of  "knowledge  work"   and  "knowledge  workers"  resulting  from  the  development  of  large  modern   organizations  such  as  business  enterprises,  government  instrumentalities,  large   universities,  research  laboratories  and  hospitals.  He  made  a  provocative  assertion  for   the  time,  suggesting,  "knowledge  has  become  the  `primary'  industry,  the  industry  that   supplies  to  the  economy  the  essential  and  central  resources  of  production"  (Drucker   1968).  Others  have  reflected  on  the  evolution  of  western  enterprise  in  this  period  from   high-volume  pyramidal  structures  to  high-value  organizational  webs  reaching  across  the   globe  (Reich  1992).        The  resulting  organizational  structure  required  decentralized  decision-making   and  power  that  was  located  closer  to  where  the  required  knowledge  skills   predominated.    Reich  (1992)  acknowledged  this  trend  was  a  threat  to  the  American   economy  as  skilled  jobs  and  profits  from  American  corporations  increasingly  flowed  out   of  the  country.    The  global  marketplace  regarded  jobs  as  commodities  to  be  traded   where  the  returns  were  most  immediate  and  profitable.  The  globalization  of   organizations  has  created  far-reaching  social  change,  with  traditional  patterns  of   employment  being  radically  altered  and  destroyed.  In  corporations  whose  were   headquarter  were  based  in  North  America,  the  outsourcing  of  components  of  the   business  and  the  ripples  created  by  deregulation  of  international  banking  created   organizational  instability  and  massive  job  layoffs.          Middle  management  jobs  were  those  that  took  the  brunt  of  economic   rationalism  in  the  1980s  with  organizations  moving  to  flatter  and  more  efficient  means   of  channelling  information.  "Many  of  mid-management's  uncreative  tasks  can  now  be   done  better  and  faster  by  computers  and  telecommunications  networks...  IBM...   estimates  that  just  one  part  of  its  internal  electronic  network  replaces...  40,000   additional  middle  managers  and  white  collar  workers"  (Toffler  1990).      51  

  
   The  organizational  structures  that  emerged  saw  management  forced  to  take  a   more  active  leadership  role,  supported  by  general  clerical  staff  that  were  expected  to  be   more  responsible  and  self-motivated.    The  space  previously  filled  by  the  middle   manager  became  a  blurred  line  with  increasing  responsibility  for  those  above  and  below   it.      New  approaches  to  managing  the  workplace  were  focused  on  breaking  down   communication  silos  and  building  teams  using  communication  technologies  that   facilitated  employee  mobility  (Duffy  2003).  In  many  areas  of  knowledge  work,  workers   were  no  longer  tethered  to  the  desk  but  were  increasingly  encouraged  to  work  where   they  were  most  productive  (Drucker  1993).    Cell  phones  and  laptop  computers  have   increasingly  allowed  workers  to  work  remotely  from  the  office  while  remaining  in   constant  communication.    Knowledge  workers  work  at  clients'  offices,  in  hotels  and   coffee  shops,  while  commuting  around  the  city  and  in  remote  locations.  They  have  been   liberated  from  their  desks  and  are  able  to  influence  the  environments  they  prefer  to   work  from.  These  innovations  in  office  design  represent  a  significant  shift  away  from  the   embedded  grids  and  hierarchies  of  the  workplace  of  the  1960s.  However,  they  were  not   driven  by  improved  technologies  alone;  the  rising  cost  of  real  estate  in  urban  centres   and  the  need  for  organizations  to  be  agile  required  lower  overhead  and  the  increased   ability  to  respond  quickly  to  shifting  demand.      Work  environments  designed  for  the  "creative  elites"  from  the  2000s  onwards   have  prioritized  spaces  for  socializing  and  conversing  with  work  colleagues,  including   cafes  and  impromptu  meeting  spaces,  touchdown  desks  that  allow  workers  to  adjust  the   height  of  their  work  surface  from  standing  to  sitting,  and  a  range  of  facilities  from  gyms   and  basketball  courts  to  pinball  machines  and  video  games.  Mobile  technologies  allow   for  personalization  of  the  "desktop"  in  dynamic  formats  constantly  accessible  to  the   user  making  tchotchkes  redundant.      Conclusion

   The  shift  in  gender  and  management  philosophies  supported  by  the  emerging   influence  of  the  newly-professionalized  interior  designer  has  resulted  in  an  office   environment  that  became  more  closely  aligned  with  women's  preferred  ways  of   working,  where  management  practices  emphasize  collaboration  and  teambuilding.    But   it  becomes  clear  that  the  innovation  in  office  design  has  largely  impacted  knowledge   workers  and  the  working  lives  of  routine  office  workers  have  received  much  less   attention  from  designers,  due  to  their  position  in  the  structure  of  organizations.    As   lower  paid  and  often  contracted  positions,  these  women  become  less  visible  to   management  and  may  be  seen  as  less  critical  to  the  company's  bottom  line.            My  dissertation  draws  on  Lefebvre's  thesis  of  the  socio-spatial  dialect  that   creates  and  recreates  the  spaces  we  occupy.  The  women  workers  can  be  seen  as   operating  in  Lefebvre's  differential  space  where  surreptitious  change  occurs  as  the   result  of  workers'  accumulated  actions.  These  actions  will  be  the  material  of  the  case   studies  that  follow  in  Chapters  Four  and  Five.  The  prospect  that  routine  clerical  work   would  be  taken  over  by  computers  has  not  yet  been  realized  and  the  routine  tasks  that   require  human  decision-making  and  critical  oversight  remain  the  work  of  mainly  women   clerical  workers.    This  work  is  referred  to  as  "on-boarding"  (as  opposed  to   "outsourcing").  The  case  studies  address  personalia  in  the  close  spaces  that  women,   working  in  the  financial  services  industry  at  Investors  Group  in  Winnipeg,  occupy  and   personalize.  The  project  seeks  to  add  to  the  critical  literature  on  the  workplace  by   studying  the  creation  of  identity  and  meaning  at  the  desks  of  clerical  workers  left  in  the   wake  of  a  mobile  society.

CHAPTER  THREE     

WINNIPEG  AND  INVESTORS  GROUP  
   Introduction      This  chapter  will  be  grounded  in  the  theory  of  the  space  of  flows  first  formulated  by   Manuel  Castells  (1996).  Castells  theorized  the  rapid  increase  in  the  movement  of  capital,   information  and  people  was  a  response  to  neoliberalism,  technology  and  globalization  in  the  late   1970s  and  1980s.  The  deregulation  of  money  markets  allowed  for  unprecedented  financial   freedom  for  large  organizations  and  wealthy  individuals  to  play  the  money  markets  and  diversify   their  investments.  Corporations  had  access  to  global  finances  and  were  able  to  influence  markets   outside  of  their  country  of  origin  and  establish  bases  internationally.    Added  to  this  was  the   movement  of  people  across  the  globe  following  employment  and  education  opportunities,  with   migrants  seeking  a  more  secure  future  for  themselves  and  their  families.  The  flows  of  information   were  related  to  both  capital  and  people  but  were  facilitated  by  new  communication  technologies   that  connected  cities  across  the  globe  simultaneously.          Projects  are  worked  on  24  hours,  seven  days  a  week,  as  information  moves  across   international  timelines.      Global  flows  do  not  only  affect  large  cities  like  Tokyo  and  New  York.  The   ways  of  working  that  were  facilitated  by  new  telematic  communications  influenced  all  centres  of   commerce,  as  markets  and  methods  of  production  morphed  and  changed.    Immigration  to  urban   centres,  where  lives  were  safer  and  opportunities  for  work  were  greater,  grew   disproportionately.    Finding  homes  for  newcomers  put  pressure  on  the  real  estate  markets  in  the   larger  cities,  driving  up  the  cost  of  living.        Overpopulation,  economic  and  political  difficulties  in  the  Philippines  caused  massive   emigration  starting  in  the  1970s.    Cities  like  Winnipeg,  Manitoba,  offered  a  more  affordable   lifestyle  that  appealed  to  many  new  migrants  to  Canada.  Thus  the  population  of  migrants,   particularly  those  from  the  Philippines,  grew  steadily  at  this  time.  The  migrants'  "exodus  from  the   Philippines  in  the  second  half  of  the  twentieth  century  was  influenced  by  increasingly  intertwined   global  economic  networks  and  domestic  politics.  Personal  motivations  to  leave  their  country  and      55  

  
families  behind  in  search  of  better  opportunities  in  foreign  lands  are  based  not  just  on  practical   reasons  but  also  on  a  complex  combination  of  compelling  cultural,  economic,  and  political   factors,  including  gender  roles"  (Bonifacio  2013:  4).      Canada  developed  a  policy  to  encourage  skilled  and  well-trained  Filipinos,9  who  benefited   from  good  quality  public  education  in  the  Philippines,  to  fill  positions  in  health  care  and  the   garment  industry,  as  well  as  clerical  and  technical  positions.10       "Women  make  up  a  particularly  large  proportion  of  the  Filipino  community  (in  Canada).  This  is   especially  true  of  women  in  their  prime  working  years.  In  2001,  57%  of  the  Filipino  community,   compared  to  51%  of  all  Canadians,  were  female"  (Statistics  Canada).  The  Philippines  has  become   the  third  largest  source  of  immigrants  in  Canada,  after  China  and  India.  These  immigration   patterns  reflect  the  space  of  flows,  bringing  Filipino  women  into  global  cities  such  as  Toronto,   from  which  they  are  diverted  to  smaller  cities  in  the  network  such  as  Winnipeg.       The  contemporary  office  is  one  of  the  principle  spatial  sites  of  the  space  of  flows  (Stalder   2001).  The  shift  began  in  the  1980s  from  centralized  and  hierarchical  organizations  that  were   highly  efficient  but  extremely  inflexible;  moving  quickly  to  networked  and  geographically   distributed  organizations  functioning  in  real-time  due  to  sophisticated  communications   technologies  that  offered  greater  flexibility.  However,  head  offices  have  remained  central  to   organizational  functions.    Sassen  explains,  "The  more  dispersed  a  firm's  operations  across   different  countries,  the  more  complex  and  strategic  are  its  central  functions  ­  that  is,  the  work  of   managing,  co-ordinating,  servicing,  financing  a  firm's  network  of  operations"  (2000:  111).      This  dissertation  projects  the  theory  of  the  space  of  flows  into  the  corporate  office  where   it  is  embodied.  Knowledge  workers  are  increasingly  mobile  and  unfettered  by  routines.  They                                                                                                                   
9  Canadian  adults  of  Filipino  origin  are  much  more  likely  than  the  rest  of  the  population  to  have  a  university  degree.  

In  2001,  31%  of  Canadians  of  Filipino  origin  aged  15  and  over  had  either  a  Bachelor's  or  post-graduate  degree.  This  is   more  than  double  the  figure  for  the  overall  adult  population,  only  15%  of  which  had  a  degree  (Statistics  Canada,  The   Filipino  Community  in  Canada  http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-621-x/89-621-x2007005-eng.htm#5).  

10  Canadians  of  Filipino  origin  with  post-secondary  qualifications  are  more  likely  to  hold  degrees  in  highly  technical  

fields.  In  2001,  people  of  Filipino  origin  made  up  about  2%  of  all  university  graduates  in  Canada,  but  represented  3%   of  those  with  degrees  in  engineering  or  applied  science,  and  3%  of  those  with  degrees  in  health-related  professions   and  technologies  (Statistics  Canada,  The  Filipino  Community  in  Canada  http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-621-x/89- 621-x2007005-eng.htm#5).

imitate  the  mobility  of  the  professional  elite  who  travels  between  centres  of  finance,  shifting   their  place  of  work  to  suit  the  task,  and  taking  advantage  of  opportunities  as  they  arise.    The   routine  clerical  workers  are  the  underclass  in  the  contemporary  organization,  performing  jobs   that  are  usually  contracted  out  and  occupied  by  women,  who  are  often  immigrants.    They  are   captive  in  a  hegemonic  system  that  keeps  them  doing  routine  work  with  little  prospect  of   promotion.11    They  are  not  beneficiaries  of  the  new  democratic  ways  of  managing  organizations   because  "at  the  lowest  levels  of  the  organization,  where  fairly  large  numbers  of  women  do   routine  computer  aided  work,  there  seem  to  be  few  possibilities  of  worker  participation  in   decision-making  because  few  decisions  are  made  at  that  level"  (Acker  1992:  57).      Castells  argues  there  is  a  crisis  of  conflicting  demands  between  the  spaces  of  flow  and  the   space  of  places  in  cities,  with  a  resulting  "fragmentation  in  the  framing  of  social  life".  He  describes   cities  as  communication  systems  that  link  the  local  and  the  global,  where  the  global  is  often  much   more  powerful  than  the  local,  and  increasingly  the  individual  is  forced  to  co-exist  and  negotiate   individual  and  collective  identities.  Castells  believes  space  expresses  society,  as  "it  is  a   fundamental  dimension  of  society,  inseparable  from  the  overall  process  of  formation"  of  a   networked  society  (2004:  441).          The  ways  we  can  see  this  in  the  office  is  in  the  fragmentation  of  traditional  human   management  systems  to  deal  with  very  different  ways  of  working.    Knowledge  workers  require   different  management  techniques;  they  are  increasingly  seen  as  self-managing  and  supported  by   technology,  whereas  routine  office  workers  can  be  closely  monitored  and  their  productivity   measured  by  keystrokes.  The  creation  of  teams  is  often  performed  virtually  for  knowledge   workers,  whereas  routine  clerical  workers  rely  on  teams  to  do  higher-level  tasks  requiring   experience  and  face-to-face  support.      

                                                                                                                 11  In  2001,  33%  of  women  of  Filipino  origin  had  a  university  degree,  compared  to  27%  of  their  male  counterparts.  In  
comparison,  in  the  overall  (Canadian)  population  16%  of  men  and  15%  of  women  had  a  university  degree.    People   who  reported  Filipino  origin  made  up  about  1%  of  all  workers,  but  represented  2%  of  people  employed  in  health   occupations  and  manufacturing.  In  contrast,  their  representation  was  disproportionately  low  among  those  holding   management  positions,  as  well  as  among  those  employed  in  education,  government  and  the  social  sciences  (Statistics   Canada,  The  Filipino  Community  in  Canada  http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-621-x/89-621-x2007005-eng.htm#5).

   The  space  that  expresses  these  two  classes  or  levels  of  work  have  received  very  different   attention  from  employers  and  designers.    Space  for  the  knowledge  elites  is  carefully  considered,   well-funded  and  considered  an  investment,  whereas  the  design  of  space  for  routine  clerical   workers  is  often  subcontracted  to  furniture  companies,  considered  to  be  less  relevant  to  the   businesses'  bottom  line  and  slow  to  be  upgraded.      The  space  occupied  by  the  women  who  are  the  subjects  of  the  case  studies  has  not   changed  substantively  since  1987.  The  one  advantage  of  working  in  space  designed  in  the  1980s   is  the  size  of  the  desks  and  corridors  is  generous  in  comparison  with  space  standards  of  today.   Clerical  workers  were  not  the  focus  of  design  intentions  for  the  creation  of  the  new  headquarters   in  the  1980s,  with  the  planning  of  their  spaces  being  assigned  to  the  furniture  suppliers,  and  they   remain  an  undervalued  resource  in  2015.    "Typically  the  sectors  and  occupations  filled  by  women   tend  to  have  lower  income  ceilings,  poorer  benefits  and  less  career  mobility"  (Hansen  and  Pratt   1995:  3).          Data  from  20  global  markets  shows  women  comprise  nearly  60  percent  of  employees  in   the  financial  services  industry,  but  only  19  percent  progress  through  the  leadership  ranks  to   senior  level  roles.  Board  and  CEO  representation  is  more  telling;  women  hold  only  14  percent  of   board  seats  and  two  percent  of  CEO  positions.12      The  unmooring  associated  with  the  movement  of  immigrants  or  transnational  identities   generates  a  need  for  the  creation  of  a  space  of  identity  (Sassen  1999),  and  in  the  office  the  desk   represents  such  a  place  for  those  workers  to  recreate  identities.          This  chapter  will  establish  the  context  of  the  Investors  Group  financial  services  company   being  studied.    It  looks  at  Winnipeg,  its  history  and  urban  development,  and  discusses  the  Core   Area  Initiative  that  led  to  the  decision  in  the  1980s  to  construct  the  new  headquarters  for  IG  at   One  Canada  Centre  on  Portage  Avenue  in  the  downtown  area.  The  context  of  Investors  Group's   history  and  its  relationship  to  the  city  is  addressed,  as  is  the  narrative  of  the  building  and  its   designer's  aspirations  and  the  critics'  evaluation.    The  chapter  will  introduce  the  interior   designers'  role  and  the  shift  in  organizational  culture  represented  by  One  Canada  Centre.    It  will                                                                                                                    12  World  Economic  Forum,  The  Corporate  Gender  Gap  Report  2010.

provide  a  context  for  the  idea  of  a  building  designed  for  the  financial  services  industry  in  the   1980s  with  its  largely  female  clerical  workforce  and  look  at  the  rapid  evolution  of  technology.         Winnipeg        Winnipeg's  geography  and  location  has  been  the  source  of  much  of  the  city's  growth  and   identity.  Situated  at  the  confluence  of  the  Red  and  Assiniboine  rivers,  the  city  grew  up  around  the   ancient  site  of  meetings  and  trade  for  aboriginal  peoples  travelling  on  traditional  canoe  routes.13     The  name  Winnipeg  is  derived  from  the  Cree  word  for  muddy  waters  ­"winipe-k".    As  the   Europeans  settled  North  America,  Winnipeg's  central  location  in  the  continent  made  it  a  logical   hub  for  the  distribution  of  people,  produce,  and  goods  moving  around  Canada  and  from  Canada   into  the  United  States.    The  French  trappers  married  into  the  aboriginal  population,  creating  a   distinct  new  culture  and  people  called  the  Metis.  There  is  a  strong  French  and  Metis  culture  in   evidence  in  Winnipeg  that  is  celebrated  in  the  winter  at  the  Festival  du  Voyager,  in  French- speaking  communities  such  as  St.  Boniface,  and  in  a  vibrant  and  diverse  artistic  community.      Winnipeg  grew  with  the  mass  immigration  that  occurred  when  the  Canadian  Pacific   Railway  link  to  Eastern  Canada  was  completed  in  1881.    Sir  Clifford  Sefton,  Minister  of  the  Interior   (1896-1905),  promoted  immigration  by  Ukrainians,  Mennonites  and  Hungarians  whose  forbearers   had  been  farmers  in  harsh  climates  similar  to  the  Canadian  Prairies.  These  groups  settled  the   Prairies  rather  than  congregating  in  the  cities  and  were  followed  by  Icelandic,  Chinese  and  Jewish   immigrants.14  By  1887  the  Canadian  National  Railway  provided  a  lucrative  transport  route   crossing  Canada,  from  east  to  west.15  "The  boom  period  of  immigration  between  1867  and  1914   had  a  major  impact  on  the  development  of  the  Prairies,  and  has  permanently  shaped  Canada's   society,  economy,  and  culture"  (Gagnon  n.d.).  

                                                                                                                 13  The  rivers  provided  an  extensive  transportation  network  linking  many  indigenous  peoples,  including

The  canal  allowed  for  shipping  and  trade   to  move  directly  from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Pacific  oceans.

   Economic  drivers  in  the  prairie  province  of  Manitoba  have  been  grain  and  pulse  growing,   with  Winnipeg  becoming  the  location  of  the  Canadian  Wheat  Board  in  1935,  and  attracting   representation  from  major  banking  institutions.    Winnipeg  is  also  home  to  major  insurance  and   investment  corporations  such  as  Great  West  Life  Insurance  and  Investors  Group,  who  followed   the  money  to  the  city  once  known  as  the  Chicago  of  the  North.      The  essential  components  of  a  rich  cultural  life  were  established  early  in  Winnipeg.  The   first  university  in  Western  Canada  was  established  only  seven  years  after  the  province  was   founded  in  1870.  The  University  of  Manitoba  was  established  in  1877  to  confer  degrees  on   students  of  all  backgrounds,  graduating  from  the  three  founding  colleges:  St.  Boniface  College,  St.   John's  College  and  Manitoba  College.  In  1912  Canada's  first  civic  gallery  was  established  by  a   group  of  Winnipeg  businessmen  wanting  to  bring  the  civilizing  effects  of  art  and  culture  to  the   city.  This  gallery  became  the  Winnipeg  Art  Gallery,  famous  for  its  early  collection  of  Inuit  carvings.     Winnipeg  became  the  capital  of  Manitoba  and  the  seat  of  the  provincial  legislature.        Development  of  The  Downtown      The  development  of  Portage  Avenue  as  a  premier  retail  location  began  with  the   construction  of  the  Eaton's  building  in  1905.    It  was  so  successful  that  an  additional  floor  was   added  within  a  year  of  the  store  opening.16  The  Hudson's  Bay  Company  (HBC)  was  delayed  in   building  its  planned  department  store  on  Portage  Avenue  by  the  recession  and  World  War  I.  By   the  time  the  store  was  opened  in  1926  the  south  side  of  Portage  Avenue  was  well  established  as   the  dominant  retail  strip.  The  HBC  store  marked  the  western  edge  of  the  business  district  and   helped  to  raise  property  values.  "Indeed  by  the  end  of  the  1915-45  period,  both  sides  of  Portage   Avenue  were  lined  by  variety,  specialty  and  department  stores,  many  of  them  in  separate   buildings,  but  others  occupying  the  ground  floor  of  office  structures"    (Lyon  and  Fenton  1984:  96).      The  downtown  of  Winnipeg  had  developed  along  the  bullock  tracks  and  carriageways  of  

the  original  township  without  any  kind  of  planning  or  design  consideration.  Businesses  would

close  or  relocate,  leaving  vacancies  and  perpetuating  the  spread  of  retail  activity  over  long   stretches  of  the  downtown.17        The  effects  of  decentralization  were  most  evident  after  the  establishment  of  suburban   developments  in  1948  and  compounded  by  a  policy  to  build  six  regional  suburban  shopping  malls,   five  of  which  were  completed  by  1969.18  The  opening  of  the  Polo  Park  Shopping  Mall  on  Portage   Avenue  in  1959,  three  kilometres  outside  the  central  business  district,  in  combination  with   growing  suburban  retail  strip  malls,  had  a  deleterious  effect  on  downtown  retail  business  which   was  estimated  to  represent  only  approximately  21  percent  of  Winnipeg's  retail  sales  in  1982.     Winnipeg  suffered  the  fate  of  many  North  American  cities  where  the  centre  declined  as  the   suburbs  boomed."The  decade  1950  ­  1960  was  one  of  the  most  vigorous  growth  periods  in  the   history  of  Greater  Winnipeg.  During  that  decade  the  metropolitan  area  grew  by  an  average  of   3.4%  per  year"  It  then  declined  ­  in  the  60's  it  averaged  1.35%  per  year,  70's  averaged  0.8%  per   year,  first  half  of  80's  0.5%  per  year"  (Levin  1984:  23).      In  Canada  the  1980s  were  a  time  of  rapid  development  of  the  suburbs  established  after  

World  War  II.  By  the  1970s  growth  in  Winnipeg  was  almost  at  a  standstill.    As  retailers  moved  to   the  suburbs,  empty  shopfronts  became  a  plague  in  the  North  Portage  area,  sapping  the  vitality  of   the  city  and  decreasing  the  public  perception  of  safety  in  the  downtown  area.    In  response  to  this   perception  of  a  dying  and  dangerous  downtown,  a  number  of  prominent  business  people  came   together  to  discuss  the  issue  and  proposed  possible  solutions.      Federal  and  provincial   governments  supported  major  revitalization  and  planning  solutions  in  Winnipeg.  The  result  was   one  of  the  nation's  largest  and  most  notable  regeneration  efforts,  the  Core  Area  Initiative  (CAI)   launched  in  1981.  "Spanning  a  decade  and  reflecting  unprecedented  tri-level  governmental  co- operation,  the  CAI  was  considered  to  be  a  unique  and  notable  experiment  in  public  policy  and   drew  considerable  attention  throughout  North  America  and  Europe"  (Layne  2000:  249-50).            The  CAI  took  an  integrated  approach  to  community  development  with  a  focus  on  

employment  and  economic  development,  physical  renewal,  training  and  education.

It  represented  a  unique  opportunity  to  create  a  development  funded  over  the  longer  term.  The   CAI  had  representation  from  three  levels  of  government:  the  city,  the  province  and  the  federal   government.  The  committee  was  struck  to  strategically  invest  $196  million  dollars  in  focused   urban  development  over  a  period  of  eight  years.    The  CAI  investment  acted  as  seed  funds  for  over   $300  million  dollars  from  the  private  sector  for  retail,  commercial  and  residential  urban   development.19      The  North  Portage  Development  Corporation  (NPDC)  was  incorporated  in  1983  with  a   specific  mandate  to  provide  a  mechanism  for  implementing  the  redevelopment  of  the  North   Portage  area,  seen  to  be  the  most  in  need  of  redevelopment,  through  a  combination  of   investments  by  the  corporation,  private  sector,  institutions  and  government.  Lyon  and  Fenton   summarize  the  significant  components  of  the  desired  redevelopment.    The  official  Metro   Development  Plan  (1968)  identified  a  number  of  issues  such  as  need  to  have  residential   development  in  close  proximity  to  retail,  office  and  open  space  in  the  downtown.   Investors  Group  Limited      The  Investors  Group  today  is  IGM  Financial  Incorporated,  a  Canadian  financial  services   company  with  $120.7  billion  in  total  assets  under  management  as  of  December  31,  2012.    It  is  a   publicly  traded  subsidiary  of  the  Power  Corporation  of  Canada,  a  major  financial  services  provider   and  one  of  the  country's  leading  mutual  fund  firms.  The  company  has  grown  exponentially  since   its  establishment  by  appealing  to  the  growing  middle  class  as  an  unpretentious,  egalitarian   organization  with  a  sense  of  civic  responsibility.    Investors  Group  has  an  established  reputation  as   a  good  employer;  offering  employees  low  interest  mortgages  and  stock  purchase  incentives  and   instituting  exemplary  employee  recognition  programs.  They  also  have  a  strong  record  of  civic   responsibility,  and  community  support  and  development:  an  example  would  be  the  construction   of  the  Investors  Group  Field  at  the  University  of  Manitoba  as  the  home  of  the  Winnipeg  Blue   Bombers  football  team.     The  research  associated  with  this  project  has  been  carried  out  with  the  co-operation  of   Investors  Group.  This  Winnipeg-based  investment  firm  specializes  in  mutual  funds,  retirement   investments,  mortgages  and  other  long-term  investment  products.    Its  operational  model  is

founded  on  regionally  based  investment  advisors  who  deal  with  clients  face-to-face.  The  head   office  is  the  operational  and  administrative  centre  of  the  business  and  presents  the  face  of  the   corporation  to  employees,  consumers  and  the  media.   IG  has  its  origins  in  Investors  Syndicate  of  Canada  Ltd.,  which  was  incorporated  through   legislation  in  Winnipeg  in  1940.20  The  company  had  operated  as  Investors  Syndicate  Inc.,  an   offshoot  from  an  American  company  of  the  same  name,  since  1926.  Based  in  Minnesota,  the   company  had  been  set  up  by  John  Tappan  in  1884  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  salaried  working   class.    He  recognized  the  average  person's  mistrust  of  banks,  and  developed  a  weekly  personal   saving  scheme  with  financial  counselling,  sold  in  the  same  way  as  insurance.      The  system  was   eminently  successful  and  was  transplanted  to  Canada  in  1926.  By  1940  there  were  13  sales  offices   located  in  seven  of  the  nine  provinces  of  Canada  (Jones  1993:  3).      Investors  Syndicate  of  Canada  Ltd.  launched  its  first  in-house  financial  product  in  1941  and  

Canada's  first  mutual  fund  in  1950.  The  firm  continued  to  market  financial  products  and  advice  to   ordinary  Canadians."Building  long-term  relationships  with  clients  is  the  best  way  to  help   individuals  reach  their  financial  goals  at  each  stage  of  their  lives"  (IG  website,  September  5,  2012).   Investors  Syndicate  of  Canada  Ltd.  completed  the  company's  first  purpose-designed  head   office  on  280  Broadway  Avenue  in  1956.  Designed  by  Winnipeg  Architects  Moody  and  Moore,  the   building  incorporated  a  staff  lounge  and  cafeteria.  It  was  a  four-storey  modernist  pavilion,  with  a   floor  plate  of  17,000  square  feet  per  floor  to  house  a  staff  of  approximately  187  employees.  In   1963  the  building  was  extended  by  three  floors,  to  accommodate  personnel  growth  and   expanded  financial  services.  This  building  is  described  in  greater  detail  in  Chapter  Four.      By  the  1980s  the  company  recognized  it  had  outgrown  the  expanded  building  and  needed   to  find  new  accommodation  that  would  allow  a  consolidation  of  functions  and  departments  that   had  expanded  beyond  the  Broadway  address  and  provide  for  their  continued  strong  growth.    The   Investors  Group  became  a  member  of  the  Montreal-based  Power  Financial  Corporation  group  of   companies  in  1986.

In  1987  IG  employed  1,850  financial  planners  in  73  planning  centres  throughout  Canada.21   In  Winnipeg  IG  employed  822  staff  at  the  end  of  1986,  located  mostly  in  their  head  office  but  also   housed  in  outlying  office  buildings.      Chief  Executive  Officer  (CEO)  Art  Mauro  determined  that   their  issue  of  lack  of  space  would  be  best  addressed  with  a  new  building  on  a  prominent  site   representing  the  western  boundary  of  the  proposed  new  North  Portage  development  site.   Instead  of  expanding  their  existing  premises  on  Broadway  Avenue  where  they  had  accumulated   adjacent  land,  Mauro,  who  was  a  board  member  of  the  NPDC  and  a  booster  for  Winnipeg,  saw  an   opportunity  in  the  Core  Area  Initiative  and  the  development  of  Portage  Avenue  to  reposition   Investors  Group.      The  potential  site  was  located  on  Portage  Avenue  between  Vaughan  and  Colony,  across   from  the  Hudson  Bay  retail  store,  and  facing  south  towards  the  Legislative  buildings.    Mauro   described  the  location  as  forming  the  apex  of  "a  triangle  of  power"  that  included  the  big  banks  at   Portage  and  Main  and  politicians  in  the  Legislative  building.22  The  site  would  give  the  organization   a  significant  visual  connection  to  both.    The  CEO`s  office  was  to  be  located  so  it  had  a  clear  view   to  the  Legislature.    Investors  Group  negotiated  a  100-year  lease  for  the  site,  with  North  Portage   Development  Corporation  retaining  ownership  of  the  site.  Investors  Group  would  fund  the  cost  of   developing  the  building  designed  to  meet  its  requirements.    The  site  was  key  in  the  North  Portage   Development  Corporation  plans  to  develop  the  north  side  of  Portage  Avenue;  IG  would  act  as  the   "western  anchor"23  for  the  development,  and  as  such  would  be  the  beneficiary  of  new  housing,   retail  and  services  that  were  planned  as  intrinsic  components  of  the  larger  North  Portage   development.    In  return  Investors  Group  would  bring  a  salaried  population  of  800  employees  to   the  site,  ensuring  urban  vitality.        The  retail  component,  Portage  Place  Mall,  was  planned  as  a  foil  to  the  suburban  retail   malls  that  were  springing  up  outside  the  city.  The  city  mall  would  give  downtown  shoppers  an   undercover  retail  environment  with  free  on-site  parking  and  access  to  the  major  retailers,  such  as   the  Bay  and  Eaton's  on  Portage  Avenue,  via  a  network  of  raised  walkways.

   Investors  Group's  commitment  to  playing  a  key  role  in  the  promotion  and  growth  of  the   downtown  was  expressed  through  the  process  of  designing,  building  and  outfitting  the  18-storey   building.  The  building  today  remains  largely  as  it  was  designed  and  completed  25  years  ago.      It   was  conceived  of  primarily  as  an  investment  property,  with  five  floors  to  be  sublet  to  a  number  of   complimentary  businesses  such  as  the  Royal  Bank,  a  legal  firm,  stockbroker  and  travel  agent.  The   provision  of  floor  space  beyond  the  foreseeable  needs  of  the  organization  allowed  the  firm  to   continue  to  grow  in  good  times,  and  the  leasable  space  was  quickly  absorbed  by  the  natural   growth  of  the  company.      Globalization      Very  high  interest  rates  and  volatile  deregulated  financial  markets  marked  the  '80s  in   Canada.  The  stock  market  crashed  in  1982  and  again  in  1987,  destabilizing  real  estate  prices  and   mortgage  rates  and  frightening  investors.    Remarkably  Investors  Group  continued  to  grow   through  the  1980s,  offering  its  clients  a  secure  environment  for  their  savings,  experiencing  very   few  layoffs,  and  by  1986  posting  sales  figures  of  more  than  $1.4  billion,  a  34  per  cent  increase   over  the  previous  year's  sales.  Investors  Group  had  been  slowly  growing  its  global  reach.  It   started  with  an  IG  International  Mutual  Fund  in  1962  and  developing  its  first  offshore  fund  in   1971  with  investors  Japanese  Growth  Fund.    Investors  Group  Investment  Management  Ltd.   opened  offices  in  Dublin  in  1993  and  Hong  Kong  in  2000.    Globalization  and  the  opening  up  of   financial  markets  had  a  huge  impact  in  the  1980s.   Globalization'  seems  first  to  have  acquired  its  prominence  as  American  Express  advertised   the  global  reach  of  its  credit  card  in  the  mid-1970s...  The  term  then  spread  like  wildfire  in   the  financial  and  business  press,  mainly  as  legitimation  for  the  deregulation  of  financial   markets...  And  by  the  mid-1980s  it  helped  create  a  heady  atmosphere  of  entrepreneurial   optimism  around  the  theme  of  the  liberation  of  markets  from  state  control.    It  became  a   central  concept,  in  short,  associated  with  the  brave  new  world  of  globalizing   neoliberalism.                                (Harvey  2000:  13)      Entrepreneurial  optimism  was  in  evidence  in  North  American  corporate  office  design.  The  

post-modern  `80s  were  remarkable  for  lavish  and  extravagant  corporate  headquarters.  Reception   areas,  executive  offices  and  boardrooms  of  this  period  were  distinguished  by  custom  furniture   and  rugs  and  wall  panelling  made  from  rare  exotic  timbers,  imported  marble  floors  and  walls,      65  

  
mirror  and  glass  used  in  furniture,  and  chrome  and  brass  finishes  and  inlays.    The  effect  was  often   ostentatious,  theatrical  and  extravagant,  reflecting  a  post-modern  aesthetic  of  luxury  and  sensory   extremes  that  symbolized  the  new  optimism  evident  in  companies  competing  in  the  open  market   environment  established  under  Neoliberalism.    Companies  used  design  to  differentiate   themselves  in  the  market;  corporate  identity  was  established  with  graphic  logos  and  a  corporate   vision,  which  became  essential  components  of  a  competitive  organization.    The  appearance  of  the   building  and  its  interiors  created  an  impression  for  clients  and  employees.  The  reception  area,   executive  offices  and  boardrooms  were  considered  a  measure  of  the  substance  and  success  of   the  business  itself.      Mauro's  "Act  of  Faith"      In  comparison  to  many  corporate  executive  spaces  built  at  this  time,  the  new  Investors   Group  head  offices  were  restrained  and  conservative,  reflecting  the  values  of  both  the  enterprise   and  the  Board  of  Directors.      They  did,  however,  recreate  the  new  logo  that  represented  Investors   Group  and  carved  it  into  the  Texas  red  granite  that  clad  the  structural  columns.          The  Financial  Post  reported,  "Winnipeggers  call  the  19-storey  tower  Arthur  Mauro's  act  of   faith"  (Wells  1987).  Investors  Group  had  chosen  to  establish  its  head  offices  in  Winnipeg,   Manitoba,  conveniently  located  centrally  in  Canada,  and  with  a  contemporary  architectural   tradition  of  modernist  restraint.  Its  decision  to  be  remote  from  the  Bay  Street  stock  markets  in   Toronto  was  made  at  a  time  when  communications  between  cities  were  being  opened  up  by   improved  telecommunications  systems  and  early  data  networks.  IG  saw  an  advantage  in  being  in   a  time  zone  one  hour  removed  from  the  heat  of  the  financial  markets  in  Toronto  and  the   pressures  of  financial  decisions  made  with  the  herd.      Winnipeg  had  a  lower  cost  of  living  and  a   steady  supply  of  employees,  bolstered  by  strong  migrant  communities  such  as  the  Filipinos.        Mauro  suggests  the  form  of  the  iconic  prairie  grain  elevator  inspired  the  architecture  of   One  Canada  Centre.24  The  design  uses  a  controversial  post-modernist  architectural  language  that   speaks  to  both  the  architect  and  the  general  public  by  referencing  familiar,  vernacular  and   historical  building  elements  (Jencks  1977:  8).        The  building  acts  to  advertise  the  strength  and                                                                                                                    24  Art  Mauro,  personal  communication.  2012

success  of  the  company  to  its  dispersed  regional  field  agents,  financial  advisors  and  the  public  at   large.    One  Canada  Centre  was  designed  to  inspire  confidence  and  trust  in  employees  and   investors  alike,  with  consolidated  training  facilities  and  a  large  cafeteria  to  bring  groups  of  people   together  for  education  seminars  and  events.  "Our  $37  million  headquarters  building  is  a   handsome  symbol  of  the  strength  and  stability  of  the  company."25      Published  in  the  Winnipeg  Free  Press  in  October  1987,  Jonas  Lehrman,  Associate  Dean  in   the  Faculty  of  Architecture  at  the  University  of  Manitoba,  wrote  a  critique  of  the  newly  opened   building,  which  headlined  Out  Of  Place  ­  One  Canada  Centre  Presents  A  Pompous  Image.  Lehrman   comments  on  the  generally  understated  and  monochromatic  aesthetic  of  the  modernist  buildings   that  had  previously  formed  the  skyline  of  Winnipeg,  buildings  that  did  not  call  attention  to   themselves.    One  Canada  Centre  differs.  "Most  noticeable  about  the  exterior  is  its  Texas  granite   facing  that  has  a  warm,  light  red  colour;  this  contrasts  strongly  with  the  green  tint  of  the  window   glass  and  stronger  green  of  the  window  frame  itself  and  metal  panel  below  "(Lehrman  1987).      Lehrman  is  offended  by  the  post-modern  move  that  brings  colour  to  the  façade  and  

creates  a  termination  of  the  building  at  a  roofline  that  echoes  pitched  roofs.  He  suggests  such   novelty,  although  human  nature,  is  unnecessary  and  superficial.      This  was  not  an  unusual   criticism  of  post-modern  architecture.    Lehrman  finds  there  is  a  conflict  between  the  state-of-art   technology  and  building  services,  and  the  static  floor  plan  and  structurally  simple  architectural   design.   Here  we  find  little  structural  innovation,  in  noticeable  contrast  to  the  advanced  heating,   ventilation  and  air-conditioning  systems  that  control  the  interior  environment,  and   particularly  in  contrast  to  the  extensive  use  of  sophisticated  computer  technology  upon   which  Investors  Group  depends.  Many  patrons  like  their  building  to  stand  out  from  its   neighbours.  Yet  the  static,  symmetrical,  almost  pompous  appearance  of  One  Canada   Centre  seems  at  variance  with  the  image  expected  of  a  flexible  and  dynamic  company   (1987).      Investors  Group  made  no  apologies,  describing  the  building  to  employees  in  their  in-house   magazine  The  Cornerstone  as  follows:  "The  Investors  building  will  present  a  solid  front,  stable,  yet

progressive.    The  most  impressive  feature  of  the  new  building  is  the  grand...colonnade,  a  curved   front  three  stories  high.    As  the  tower  rises  gracefully  above,  it  will  create  a  striking  frontal  effect,   a  fitting  tribute  to  investors."26  The  populist  nature  of  post-modern  design  served  Investors  Group   well,  and  the  simplicity  of  the  floor  plate  has  allowed  for  necessary  replanning  of  departments  to   be  carried  out  with  relative  ease.      At  the  time  the  offices  were  planned,  technology  was  advancing  into  the  workplace  with   unanticipated  speed.    At  the  beginning  of  the  planning  process  the  company  imagined  one   microcomputer  would  service  four  employees.  By  the  time  the  building  was  completed  some  18   months  later,  two  employees  shared  a  desktop  computer.27  An  employee  interviewed  for  the  in- house  magazine,  The  Cornerstone,  noted  somewhat  prophetically,"No  one  can  be  sure  how   technology  will  affect  us,"  says  Sophie  Melnychuk,  assistant  manager,  New  Building  Project.     "People  won't  just  change  jobs,  their  jobs  will  change  too"  (The  Cornerstone,  7:  2  (February)   1986).

      One  Canada  Centre  was  designed  to  provide  unprecedented  access  to  the  space  of  flows   through  the  provision  of  oversize  ducts  and  raceways  that  distributed  the  power  and  computer   cabling  through  the  core  and  around  the  perimeter  of  the  building.  This  feature  has  enabled  easy   changes  in  the  configuration  of  floors  and  the  arrangement  of  offices  and  workstations.  The   computer  system  at  the  time  the  building  was  completed  required  the  entire  fourth  floor  of  the   building.  It  was  provided  with  raised  access  floor  and  its  own  air-conditioning  system.      The   elevators  were  staggered  to  give  rapid  access  to  all  levels  of  the  building  with  a  separate  elevator   having  access  to  basement  parking.      Conceived  of  as  a  development  project,  Investors  Group  chose  to  work  with  the   development  firm  Lincorp  and  Sam  Linhart,  with  whom  it  had  carried  out  another  property   development  in  Phoenix.      The  Phoenix  project  acted  as  a  model  for  One  Canada  Centre.  The   developer  brought  a  team  together  to  allow  for  the  most  efficient  design  and  construction   process.    The  architects  for  the  design  of  the  building  were  a  Toronto-based  firm  known  for  their   successful  commercial  office  projects,  the  Webb  Zerafa  Menkes  Housden  (WZMH)  Partnership.   Number  Ten  Architectural  Group  managed  the  construction  project  in  Winnipeg.    Rice  Brydone,   the  Toronto  interior  design  firm,  was  brought  into  the  project  from  the  beginning,  having   established  a  close  working  relationship  with  WZMH  Partnership  on  previous  projects  of  this   scale.  Insite  Design  were  also  engaged  from  the  beginning  of  the  project,  as  its  parent  company   Business  Furnishings  Limited  were  long-time  suppliers  of  Steelcase  furniture  to  Investors  Group   and  other  office  specialists.  The  collaborative  team  that  developed  from  this  unusual  but   productive  arrangement  enabled  the  project  to  move  forward  quickly,  with  close  attention  to   budget  and  careful  co-ordination  of  design  elements.28        The  floor  plate  for  the  building  moved  away  from  the  deep  office  space  more  typical  of   North  American  office  buildings  designed  in  the  1950s  and  1960s  (Duffy  1976).  The  plan  is  at  its   largest  at  the  base  where  floors  two  and  three  wrap  around  the  large  public  atrium  that  is  the   primary  entrance  into  the  building.    The  atrium  is  three  stories  high,  creating  a  curved  drum  at   the  Portage  Street  façade  housing  Warren  Carther's  soaring  glass  sculpture,  "A  Prairie  Boy,"

installed  in  1994.    Floors  four  to  17  assume  a  rectangular  floor  plate  with  elevators,  stairs  and   services  located  centrally,  and  the  maximum  distance  from  the  core  being  approximately  40  feet.     On  executive  floors  18  and  19  the  floor  plate  is  reduced  considerably  to  provide  a  smaller   footprint  well  suited  to  the  executive  functions  of  the  organization.  A  staircase  designed  to  be  a   focal  point  of  the  executive  areas  allows  easy  movement  between  the  two  floors.      Technology      Computers  launched  in  the  1950s  were  vast  lumbering  machines,  evolved  from  Turing's   code  encryption  machine.  They  performed  simple  repetitive  tasks  faster  than  ever  before,  and   instructions  for  each  aspect  of  the  task  were  punched  on  cards  or  tape  in  numerically  based   computer  code.  Word  processors  were  first  introduced  in  the  1960s  as  intelligent  typewriters  that   allowed  for  the  correction  of  errors  and  standard  letter  formats.    The  Visual  Display  Unit  soon   followed  as  the  representation  of  the  page  on  a  screen  with  the  printer  trailing  on  behind,  giving   very  rough  draft  quality  to  this  leading  edge  technology.      Investors  Group  installed  its  first  computer  in  1961;  an  IBM  1401  with  8K  (kilobytes)  of   memory.  It  cost  approximately  half  a  million  dollars  and  was  replaced  only  two  years  later  by  an   IBM  7010  with  100K  of  memory  that  was  used  to  run  Funds  Shareholders  Accounting  and   Investors  Certificates.  It  continued  in  operation  late  into  the  `70s.  A  central  network  support   centre  was  established  at  288  Broadway  to  service  Investors'  new  "nationwide  communications   network"  dealing  with  installation,  operation  and  software  problems,  as  "regionals  are  now  using   the  terminals  for  client  and  product  information  and  fund  statement  inquiries".29  Storage  of   information  was  on  five-inch  floppy  disks.    The  computer  was  still  understood  as  an  essentially   clerical  tool  that  was  used  by  "processors",  or  as  an  adjunct  to  a  printer.      Flextime,  an  innovative  system  of  computerized  time  banking,  was  introduced  to  the  head   office  in  1974,  allowing  employees  to  choose  and  track  their  own  working  hours.  In  1982  the   Legal  Department  at  IG  implemented  computerized  contracts.    By  1984  the  Client  Relations  and   Corporate  Communications  departments  were  producing  the  Investors  Group  Annual  Report  and   letters  and  notices  to  clients  on  new  word  processing  equipment  and  a  large  laser  printer.  Fifty

regional  offices  were  equipped  with  one  terminal  and  a  printer  each  for  the  production  of   product  and  client  information  in  1985.30              In  the  1970s  and  `80s  a  dedicated  computer  room  was  still  a  fixture  in  the  modern  office   at  Investors  Group,  and  was  located  on  the  fourth  floor.  The  room  was  required  to  maintain  a   constant  temperature  and  humidity  for  the  computing  equipment  and  was  very  often  located  on   a  raised  floor  to  allow  for  the  distribution  of  cabling  from  the  central  processing  unit  (CPU),  and   peripherals  and  the  power  supply  to  every  piece  of  equipment.  The  floor  needed  to  be  able  to   support  quite  high  loads,  including  mobile  carts  to  move  supplies  and  remove  equipment  for   servicing  and  repair.  The  floor  was  also  able  to  serve  as  a  plenum  for  the  distribution  of  cooled   air.  Walls  were  fire  rated  to  safeguard  the  computer  from  an  external  fire  on  the  floor.      Equipment  such  as  paper-tape  readers,  card  punches  and  line  printers  were  quite  noisy,   and  ceilings  were  usually  dropped  acoustic  ceilings  with  gridded  fluorescent  fittings  to  maintain  a   constant  lighting  level.  Computer  rooms  were  fitted  with  smoke  suppression  devices  rather  than   sprinklers  to  avoid  the  potential  combination  of  water  and  electricity.    It  was  also  usual  to  have   backup  power  and  emergency  lighting  to  deal  with  power  and  equipment  failure.    Computer   rooms  were  the  source  of  a  great  deal  of  sensitive  information,  so  security  systems  were  required   to  secure  entrances  and  exits  from  the  space  and  waste  was  shredded  (Hutton  1976:  183-87).   The  new  head  offices  at  One  Canada  Centre  were  designed  to  provide  secretarial  support   for  managers  and  senior  executives  as  no  one  envisaged  the  possibility  of  computers  becoming   the  preferred  means  of  communication  in  all  arenas  of  office  work  in  the  near  future.    Since  the   `80s  the  finance  industry  has  become  "the  most  digitized,  dematerialized  and  globalized  of  all   activities"  in  the  economic  sector  (Sassen  1999:  116).      By  the  time  the  One  Canada  Centre  building  was  completed  in  1987,  there  was  a   dedicated  computer  complex  on  the  fourth  floor  and  half  of  the  clerical  workers  in  the  building   had  a  desktop  computer.  Two  mainframe  computers  were  used  to  run  everything  from  clients'   records  to  mutual  fund  histories.  "One  of  these  computers  ­  an  IBM  4381  ­  is  moving  directly  to   One  Canada  Centre.  The  other-  an  IBM  3090  ­  is  being  replaced  by  a  brand  new  IBM  unit  that  is   larger  and  has  more  processing  power"  (Cornerstone  August  1987).  The  computers  were  moved

over  a  long  weekend  in  October,  two  weeks  ahead  of  the  employees.  The  system  had  to  be   functioning  by  Tuesday  morning  at  8:00  a.m.  to  allow  operations  to  continue  at  280  Broadway.      The  1980s  were  a  time  of  rapid  technological  change,  and  desktop  computing  became  a   business  reality  when  IBM  released  its  first  personal  computer,  the  5150.  The  IBM  reputation  as  a   supplier  of  mainframe  computers  opened  the  door  to  major  corporations.  It  had  a  DOS  operating   system  that  was  clumsy  to  use,  but  within  the  decade  it  spawned  a  software  revolution  with   business  programs,  spread  sheets  and  word  processing  programs.    When  other  computer   companies  entered  the  market,  prices  of  desktop  and  laptop  units  came  down  and  the  pace  of   innovation  increased.    The  floppy  disk  made  storage  easier  and  in  1984  Mac  delivered  its   graphical  user  interface  which  lead  to  easily  readable  screens,  Mac/PC  compatible  software   development,  and  a  much  more  accessible  interface  for  all  users.    The  computer  continued  down   the  path  already  established  by  the  typewriter  a  century  earlier,  and  it  allowed  for  the  integration   of  functions  such  as  writing  and  publishing  and  "the  creation  of  much  private  independence"   (McLuhan  1964:  259).    As  women  took  up  typewriting,  they  also  inherited  the  role  as  computer   operators.  The  production  of  text  had  become  a  female  domain.      Conclusion      George  Nelson,  product  and  furniture  designer  and  teacher,  gave  a  guest  lecture  in   Toronto  in  1977  on  "The  Office  Revolution".    He  suggested  that  from  his  own  broad  experience   there  were  three  ingredients  that  could  be  described  as  the  source  of  a  coming  revolution  in  the   office:  electronic  developments,  furniture  and  equipment  as  sophisticated  industrial  systems  and   products,  and  "the  growing  interest  in  what  we  might  call  humane  working  environments"   (Nelson  1979:  153-59).          Discussing  electronic  developments,  Nelson  referred  to  the  fantastic  capabilities  of  new   chip  technology  to  reduce  the  size  of  future  workplace  technologies  and  lower  prices  to  make   them  affordable.  His  firm  had  completed  research  for  a  telephone  company  about  the  form  of  the   future  office,  which  predicted  technology  could  lead  us  into  the  electronic  office  as  early  as  the   1980s.    He  spoke  about  the  exponential  acceleration  of  technological  developments  being   tempered  by  a  desire  to  improve  the  office  to  create  more  humane  environments;  environments      73  

  
"that  are,  amongst  other  things  less  monotonous"  (1979:  156),  where  designers  begin  to  ask   questions  about  the  ways  people  and  work  environments  work  together  for  the  efficiency  and   satisfaction  of  all.    "With  human  motivation  and  behaviour  still  a  dark  and  mysterious  area,   anything  we  discover  here  is  bound  to  have  an  effect  on  furniture  and  interior  architecture,  not  to   mention  planning  patterns.    It  looks  as  if  a  new  breed  of  psychologist  may  presently  be  in   demand"  (1979:  159).      Nelson  spoke  about  the  scale  of  the  office  furniture  industry  and  the  need  to  move  to   industrial  production  for  all  scales  of  competitive  furniture  production.  This  shift  called  for  the   reinvention  of  office  furniture  as  a  system  of  parts.  He  pointed  to  Robert  Propst's  radical  Action   Office  System  as  a  leader  in  the  field  that  had  yet  to  be  taken  up  by  industry.  Action  Office  was   first  designed  in  1967  with  the  Quickborner's  Office  Landscape  planning  methodology  as  its   inspiration.      In  the  1960s  traditional  ways  of  operating  had  been  challenged  by  counter-culture   movements  (feminism  being  one  of  them)  such  as  the  drug  culture,  the  production  of  food,  and   healthy  lifestyles  that  had  moved  society  and  caused  businesses  to  reconsider  their  employees'   well  being,  along  with  their  increasing  community  and  environmental  responsibility.    Nelson   suggests  the  most  significant  responsibility  for  designers  in  the  future  would  be  the  humanization   of  technology  (1979:  159).      As  Nelson  reflected  on  the  coming  wave  of  change  he  captured  the  significant  issues  that   were  informing  the  design  of  offices  into  the  1980s,  however  like  many  commentators  and  critics   he  missed  the  significant  demographic  shift  that  had  occurred  in  the  50s,  60s  and  70s.  There  was   a  changing  approach  to  organizational  management  structure  that  had  become  increasingly   influential  in  the  1980s.    It  was  premised  on  the  management  philosophy  that  had  successfully   rebuilt  Japanese  industry  after  World  War  II  and  involved  working  in  teams  with  a  flatter   hierarchical  structure.  The  philosophy  was  informed  by  a  text  written  in  1941,  by  Mary  Parker   Follett,  called  Dynamic  Administration.    Follett  was  an  early  member  of  the  Human  Relations   Movement  who  continued  her  career  in  Britain,  after  being  largely  ignored  as  a  woman  working   in  organizational  behaviour.         74

   CHAPTER  FOUR          

INSIDE  THE  OFFICE  
   Introduction      In  the  1980s  North  America  saw  a  strong  shift  towards  the  commodification  of   office  buildings.    Real  Estate  investment  moved  the  development  of  office  space  from   custom  or  purpose  designed  buildings  towards  generic  office  towers  that  were  built   speculatively  and  tenanted  by  diverse  organizations."Custom  designed  buildings  have   given  way  to  ready-to-use  building  shells  which  can  be  fitted  out  with  off-the-peg   components  to  meet  specific  tenant  needs"  (Worthington  and  Allan  1988:  2).   Buildings  conformed  to  an  economic  rationalism  that  determined  a  "shell,  scenery  and   settings  approach  (Duffy  1976).  The  shell  was  designed  to  last  50  years  and  could  see   many  changes  of  activity  and  occupant;  the  building  services  "have  a  life  expectancy  of   probably  15  years,  and  possibly  even  less  as  the  pace  of  technological  change   increases...The  shell  is  adapted  to  a  specific  firm's  requirements  by  [interior]  scenery  ­   finishes,  ceilings,  light  fixtures,  furniture  etc.  [Scenery]  typically  has  a  life  span  of  5  ­  7   years  depending  on  its  specification,  reflecting  the  style  and  function  of  the   organisation"  (Worthington  and  Allan  1988:3)  .   Settings  are  the  spatial  and  furniture  configurations  that  represent  the  workspaces  and   public  spaces  for  the  human  occupation  of  the  building.  Worthington  explains  this  shift   as  the  logical  outcome  of  the  need  to  accommodate  rapid  change  brought  by  new   technologies.  "The  result  has  been  a  shift  from  custom  design  buildings  with  tailored   interior  design  layouts  to  loosely  fitting,  predesigned,  ready  to  use  shells  with  a  flexible   set  of  interior  components"  (Worthington  and  Allan  1988:  4).      The  growth  of  services  and  administrative  functions  in  the  1970s  in  North   America  saw  significant  change  in  the  percentage  of  the  population  who  were  employed   in  offices.  The  growth  of  white-collar  employees,  including  women,  meant  there  was  a      76  

  
need  for  design  specialists  who  would  closely  assess  organizational  functions  and  future   needs  and  design  to  allow  for  change.      Interior  Design  Services      Interior  designers  sought  a  close  understanding  of  the  whole  organization,  rather   than  the  often  limited  perspective  of  the  senior  executives,  and  were  able  to  provide   design  responsive  to  their  clients'  organizations.  The  interior  design  industry  developed   and  grew  in  response  to  the  need  for  knowledge  of,  and  sensitivity  to,  the   connectedness  of  disparate  elements  within  a  corporation;  and  the  willingness  to  spend   time  in  the  client  organization  interviewing  employees  and  valuing  their  experience.      Florence  Knoll  (1917),  who  was  educated  as  an  architect,  brought  a  rigorous  and   systematic  programming  approach  to  the  design  of  corporate  offices  that  was  significant   in  the  movement  towards  the  professionalization  of  interior  design.  The  Knoll  Planning   Unit  (1943-71),  led  by  Florence  Knoll  until  1965,  were  responsible  for  some  of  the  most   iconic  post-war  corporate  office  projects,  grounded  in  "painstaking  analysis  and   organization  of  functions  as  a  basis  for  interior  design"  (Rae  1999).   The  Knoll  Planning  Unit's  scope  of  services,  defined  in  the  early  1950s,  is  still   used  in  current  practice,  representing  a  radical  departure  from  interior   decoration  services  then  in  vogue.    Client  operations  were  studied  and  analysed   in  graphic  and  written  form.  Personnel  and  equipment  were  surveyed.   Interdepartmental  relations,  work  and  traffic  flow  were  studied  through  the   process  of  interviews  with  executives  and  department  supervisors.    A  preliminary   space  plan  was  developed,  and  the  character  of  the  interiors  was  established  in   consultation  with  the  client,  and  the  building  architect.      Study  models  were   constructed  and  materials  were  studied,  interior  and  exterior  materials  were   coordinated  with  the  architect.    Mechanical  and  communications  elements  were   evaluated  and  integrated  into  the  plan.    Engineering  and  shop  drawings  were   checked.  All  finishings  and  furniture  were  selected,  and  recommendations  made   for  the  functional  and  unobtrusive  placement  and  design  of  all  special      77  

  
equipment.  Construction  observation  services  were  provided  as  was  the   installation  of  all  furniture  and  furnishings.    Maintenance  manuals  were  also   provided.  (Wilkes  1989:109-10)         Professionalism  and  attention  to  detail  became  the  hallmark  of  good  practice  in  

contemporary  interior  design  services  around  the  1980s.  It  gave  designers  a  rigorous   method  with  which  to  develop  detailed  knowledge  and  understanding  of  the  specific   enterprise  being  researched,  and  to  influence  and  work  with  clients  in  all  sectors  of   business.    This  method  underpins  the  work  of  Rice  Brydone,  the  interior  design   consultant  for  the  Investors  Group  interiors,  and  is  celebrated  in  their  office  publication   The  Corporate  and  Professional  Office:  Organization  and  Design,  the  Double  Discipline   (Rice  Brydone  1983).  The  book  is  a  glossy  coffee  table  book,  illustrated  with  projects   prior  to  1983;  it  sets  out  the  role  of  the  interior  designer  in  a  commercial  project  as  a   symbiotic  union  of  two  disciplines,  creativity  and  organization.    The  text  explains,    "A   designer  is  directly  concerned  with  facilitating  useful  and  logical  work  relationships,   beginning  with  people  and  translating  their  requirements  into  spatial  ones  for   performing  daily  office  functions,  receiving  and  meeting  business  associates  and  housing   technical  operations"  (13-14)  and  "responding  to  human  needs  involves  more  human   solutions  for  living  with  high  technology,  a  softening  of  the  hard  edges  of  the  office   experience,  the  balancing  of  high  tech...  with  high  touch"  (27  ).        Architects,  for  the  most  part,  scorned  this  aspect  of  design  for  the  workplace  and   distanced  themselves  from  the  messy  human  face  of  office  design.    In  fact,  as  office   buildings  became  more  generic  the  architects'  role  in  the  design  process  was  greatly   diminished.    Worthington  makes  a  plea  to  architects  to  pay  close  attention  to  the  details   of  workplace  design  but  many  architects  in  the  UK  and  USA  felt  workplace  was  not   sufficiently  challenging  or  creative  to  be  worthy  of  their  attention.     Architects  may  expect  to  find  themselves  competing  with  `design  and  build'   services,  and  product  suppliers  who  provide  an  advice  and  installation  service.    If   architects  wish  to  continue  to  work  in  this  field  they  may  need  to  adapt  their   skills  and  services  to  compete.  (Worthington  1988:  2)      78  

  
  The  gap  was  filled  quickly  by  interior  designers,  furniture  suppliers  and  office  planners   many  of  whom  morphed  into  facilities  managers  in  the  1990s.   The  architects'  role  was  to  design  the  building  shell  and  co-ordinate  the  services  with   the  building  engineers,  while  the  finishing  of  the  building  was  turned  over  to  interior   specialists.      Feminist  Standpoint  Theory      The  interior  design  profession  has  operated  as  a  handmaiden  to  architecture,   with  architecture  as  the  traditional  "masculine"  profession  of  the  built  environment,  and   interior  design  as  the  "superficial"  feminine  newcomer.  The  20thcentury  saw  the   commercialization  and  professionalization  of  interior  design,  much  of  it  due  to  the   increasing  complexity  of  commercial  interiors.  However  "the  duality  that  places   architecture  as  the  dominant  term  in  a  binary  opposition  with  interior  design  remains   largely  deconstructed"  (Havenhand  2004:33).   Lucinda  Havenhand,  an  interior  design  academic  and  theorist,  discusses  the  problem  of   interior  design  as  a  profession  dominated  by  women  and  gay  men.  She  asserts  that   interior  design  has  yet  to  examine  its  marginal,  feminine  and  "other"  position,  and  calls   for  a  reconsideration  of  the  feminine  through  second  wave  "feminist  standpoint   theory".  Standpoint  theory  recognizes  the  gendered  construction  of  knowledge  and   reverses  the  negative  connotations  associated  with  the  feminine.     "Feminine  knowledge  and  characteristics  are  valorized,  not  as  mere  inversion  of  the   binary  opposition,  but  as  a  starting  point  for  a  new  understanding  of  knowledge"   (Havenhand  2004:36).    Havenhand  cites  Donna  Haraway  as  an  advocate  for  subjugated   standpoints  which  "are  preferred  because  they  seem  to  promise  more  adequate,   sustained,  objective,  transforming  accounts  of  the  world"  (Haraway  1988:  583).          Most  useful  for  the  subject  of  this  dissertation,  Havenhand  introduces  the  work   of  feminist  architect  Karen  Franck.    In  her  essay  "A  Feminist  Approach  to  Architecture:   Acknowledging  Women's  Ways  of  Knowing,"  Franck  establishes  specific  "feminine"   characteristics  that  will  provide  a  critical  framework  for  this  research  project  and  its      79  

  
analysis.  The  framework  is  not  without  flaws  as  it  suggests  a  set  of  gendered  universal   values  associated  with  women's  ways  of  knowing  that  might  be  seen  as  an  instrumental   or  essentialist  view  (Allcoff  1988).    However,  it  provides  a  subjective  and  embodied   entry  point  to  the  re-examination  of  office  space  from  the  perspective  of  gender.           The  qualities  Franck  develops  as  characteristic  of  "women's  ways  of  knowing"   The  underlying  understanding  of  the  connectedness  to  others,  to  knowledge  and   are  the  following:     sensitivity  to  the  connectedness  of  categories.  Franck  asserts  women's  self-identity  is   formed  through  connection  to  and  identification  with  everyday  experience.  As  a   consequence  women  tend  to  look  for  connections  rather  than  dichotomies;  "boundaries   between  categories  such  as  public/private,  work/home,  and  male/female  tend  to  be   broken  down  in  women's  ways  of  knowing"  (Havenhand  2004:39).      Desire  for  inclusiveness.    Franck  explains  that  this  characteristic  is  reflected  in  a   feminist  design  approach  that  blurs  distinctions  between  client  and  designer,  designer   and  user,  and  programmatic  distinctions  such  as  spatial  typologies  and  subjective  and   objective  knowledge.  We  can  recognize  Florence  Knoll  as  using  this  strategy  in   developing  her  approach  to  the  programming  of  corporate  projects.      Ethics  of  care  and  responsibility  to  the  needs  of  others.  Franck  also  proposes  that   the  ethics  of  care  is  more  likely  to  inform  decisions  made  by  women,  with  men  tending   to  make  decisions  informed  by  the  ethics  of  justice.    "Women  and  girls  draw  upon  a   reflective  understanding  of  care  requiring  that  no  one  be  hurt  and  that  one  respond  to   the  need  of  others,  whereas  men  and  boys  are  concerned  that  everyone  be  treated   fairly"  (Gilligan,  cited  in  Havenhand  2004:  296).    Designing  that  acknowledges  the  ethics   of  care  would  tend  to  consider  the  individual  and  the  subjective  needs  of  the  user   before  applying  universal  design  standards.        Acknowledgement  of  life  and  experience  and  the  value  of  everyday  life.  The  focus   of  women's  contribution  to  design  reforms  has  consistently  been  motivated  by  everyday   life,  examples  would  be  social  and  urban  reformers  such  as  Clare  Cooper  Marcus  and  

  

80  

  
Jane  Jacobs,  and  designers  such  as  Eileen  Gray  and  Florence  Knoll  who  brought  design   attention  to  the  mundane  details  of  living  through  their  design  projects.          Acceptance  of  subjectivity  and  feelings  as  a  strategy  this  attribute  would   manifest  itself  in  the  design  process  as  an  acknowledgement  of  personal  feelings  and   subjective  knowledge  as  valuable  in  contrast  to  rational  and  scientific  ways  of   understanding  the  world.        Acceptance  of  and  desire  for  complexity.    This  could  potentially  undermine   hierarchical  control  and  suggests  participation  from  the  users  is  characteristic  of   women's  ways  of  knowing.        Acceptance  of  change  and  desire  for  flexibility.  This  might  manifest  itself  as   valuing  multiple  voices  in  the  design  process,  embracing  the  need  for  change  and  design   for  robust  and  flexible  spaces  and  needs.      I  use  these  qualities  of  women's  ways  of  knowing  as  established  by  Franck  in   relation  to  designers,  to  develop  a  frame  of  reference  to  inform  a  discussion  and   evaluation  of  the  design  of  office  environments  with  consideration  of  women  workers.   Havenhand  makes  the  connection  between  second  wave  feminist  ways  of  knowing  and   the  interior  designer's  role  in  the  creation  of  close  space.  "Interior  designers  focus  on   the  intimate  movements,  needs,  and  emotional  concerns  of  the  users  of  interior  space,   as  individuals  and  in  connection  with  others.  Good  interior  design  creates  a  kind  of   `second  skin'  or  prosthetic  that  facilitates  or  reflects  not  only  the  functional  needs  of  its   `wearer'  but  their  emotional,  personal  and  spiritual  needs  as  well"    (Havenhand   2004:40).    The  framework  that  Franck  develops  becomes  a  useful  way  to  analyze  and   discuss  office  interiors  and  plans,  furniture  configurations  and  organizational  structures   in  response  to  women's  practices  and  values.                      81   I  begin  by  looking  at  the  masculine  modernist  office  that  served  as  Investors   Group's  (IG)  first  headquarters  in  Winnipeg.  

  
Broadway  Ave  Head  Office      In  February  1957  Life  Magazine  published  Walter  Sanders'  photographic  essay     "The  Many  Different  Lives  of  an  Office  Building".  The  essay  was  organized   chronologically  and  spatially  to  capture  a  life  in  the  day  of  the  occupants  of  260  Madison   Avenue.  As  a  visual  and  textural  source  it  is  useful  for  understanding  the  gendered   culture  of  the  office  of  the  1950s  and  1960s.  Discussing  the  images  Williams,  a  professor   of  Visual  Culture  at  Edinburgh  University  affirms  "Men  are  the  doers  in  all  of  this,   making  decisions,  holding  the  meetings,  getting  the  girls.    Women  feed,  decorate,   entertain  and  support"  (Williams  2013:99).    One  image  is  of  the  boardroom  of  Mathes   Advertising  Agency  where  the  men  make  serious  decisions,  whereas  women's  work  is   represented  by  "conviviality  and  a  shower",  an  image  of  "groups  of  women  secretaries   in  lighter  moments  of  socialization  (coffee  with  friends,  a  surprise  shower  of  gifts  for   one  of  the  group)";  and  another  image  of  a  secretary  trying  to  escape  her  boss  at  the   end  of  the  day  is  titled  "thwarted  escape".   The  sexual  politics  of  this  Life  feature  are  always  explicit.  This  is  a  world  in  which   men  are  active,  and  women  passive,  in  which  men  do  things  and  women  support   them.  Men  wear  suits  and  hats,  stand  upright,  smoke  and  make  decisions;   women  are  the  figurative  and  literal  bustle  around  them.  If  [the]  Seagram   [building]  was  the  ideal  built  representation  of  normative  sexual  politics  of  the   era,  an  upright  male  figure,  surrounded  by  attentive  females,  then  here  is  the   mundane  reality  of  that  representation.    Men  are  always  bigger,  taller,  harder,   more  assertive  and  visually  bolder.    Women  are  the  rococo  detailing,  pretty  but   not  structural.  (Williams  2013:99).     Williams  provides  a  context  for  understanding  the  admittedly  less  glamorous,  but   equally  hard  line  modernism  of  IG's  first  headquarters  in  Winnipeg.      Moody  and  Moore  were  the  architects  for  the  original  headquarters  on   Broadway  constructed  in  1956.  It  was  a  four  storey  modernist  pavilion,  with  a  floor  plate   of  17,000  square  feet  per  floor  to  house  a  staff  of  approximately  187  employees.  Moody   and  Moore  also  designed  an  extension  to  the  building  in  1963;  three  floors  to   accommodate  personnel  growth,  and  expanded  financial  services.  The  furnishing  was   carried  out  by  the  department  store  Robert  Simpson  Company.    The  executive  floor  was  

  

82  

  
relocated  to  the  new  seventh  floor  with  extensive  views  across  the  city  through  full   height  glazing  around  the  entire  perimeter.       Interiors  of  most  individual  offices  are  in  American  black  walnut  and  vinyl  wall   covering.  Storage  walls  between  offices  are  designed  as  a  series  of  oiled  walnut   panels,  some  of  which  are  hung  on  concealed  hinges,  providing  a  continuous   panelled  wall  without  visible  hardware.  All  interior  panelling  is  premium  quality   veneered  plywood,  quarter  cut  or  flat  cut,  centre  matched  and  sequence   matched  with  Danish  oil  finish  and  solid  trim  and  edges.  (Western  Construction   and  Building.1963:7)   The  building  on  Broadway  reflected  modernist  principles  and  featured  interiors  with   typically  spare  spaces,  restrained  modernist  detailing  and  contemporary  furniture  all   locally  sourced.  Only  the  president  and  the  vice  president's  offices  were  furnished  more   traditionally.  The  reception  and  executive  areas  featured  timber-panelled  walls,  terrazzo   floors  and  minimal  decoration.  Departments  were  individual  fiefdoms  with  oversized   suites  for  management.    They  were  compartmentalized,  competitive,  and  quite  separate   spatially  and  operationally  (Archer  2012:  pers.comm.;  Tyshynski  2012:  pers.comm.).     Clerical  spaces,  occupied  mainly  by  women,  were  characterized  by  the  open  `bullpen'  or   secretarial  pool,  with  bulky  metal  desks  in  formation,  and  secretaries  located  outside   management  offices  that  ranged  around  the  perimeter  window  walls  consuming  the   views  and  the  natural  light  (Tyshynski  2012:  pers.comm.).   The  seventh  floor  -  which  is  the  top  floor  of  the  extension  ­  was  designed  to   accommodate  the  executive  offices  of  the  company.    These  are  all  partitioned   offices  with  room  in  the  centre  for  the  stenographic  pool.    The  sixth  floor   includes  17  private  offices  on  the  perimeter  with  again,  central  stenographic   and  clerical  areas.  The  fifth  floor  is  largely  clerical  and  general  office  space  with   a  limited  number  of  individual  offices  (Derksen  1963).

The  fourth  floor  became  the  data  processing  department  and  housed  IG's  first   computer.      Prior  to  One  Canada  Centre,  the  work  culture  of  Investors  Group  had  developed   as  independent  and  autonomous  departments  located  in  segregated  and  spatially   separated  regions  in  the  Broadway  office.  The  new  location  One  Canada  Centre  was   planned  to  represent  a  new  culture  with  better  communication  and  transparency   between  work  units,  with  consistent  space  and  furniture  standards  for  similar  job  titles,   common  to  all  business  units.    The  company  moved  from  a  feudal  system  to  a  republic.      Organizational  Culture      By  the  1980s  organizational  management  philosophies  had  shifted  towards  less   hierarchical  office  structures  due  to  the  need  for  better  internal  communications  and   the  introduction  of  desktop  computing  which  gave  employees  greater  access  to   information.      The  global  economy  was  faster  and  competitive;  it  required  better   communications  within  the  company  and  with  the  outside  business  community.  This   shift  represents  the  beginning  of  the  flows  of  communications,  capital  and  people  that   Castells  (2000)  captures  in  his  theorization  of  the  space  of  flows.  Significantly  the  new   office  planning  for  One  Canada  Centre  moved  strongly  away  from  the  masculine   hierarchical  environment  that  had  represented  its  Broadway  facilities,  to  an      85  

  
organizational  model  developed  in  consultation  with  the  interior  designers  and   architects  for  the  new  building  (Archer  2012:  pers.comm.).      New  Strategic  Plan      In  the  1980s  amid  the  turmoil  in  global  money  markets,  Investors  Group's  board   and  management  were  experiencing  a  renewal.    With  key  retirements  and  a   restructuring  of  its  relationship  with  the  Power  Corporation,  IG  began  its  five-year   restructuring  process  by  developing  a  new  focus.  The  three  core  values  for  the   organization  were  quality  in  product  design  and  delivery;  responsiveness  to  needs  of   clients,  the  field  force,  employees  and  shareholders;  and  integrity  in  all  their  dealings.     IG  shifted  the  focus  of  its  operations  away  from  product  towards  service,  and  gave  new   importance  to  the  efficiency  of  the  operations  division.    The  plan  included   reorganization  of  management  roles  and  responsibilities,  expanded  training  for   employees  and  a  new  emphasis  on  data  processing  and  information  distribution   systems.    Arthur  Mauro,  the  new  Chief  Executive  Officer  in  1984,  saw  the  opportunity  to   design  a  new  building  to  reflect  the  revitalized  organizational  structure.    The  move  was   promoted  amongst  employees  as  an  opportunity  for  Investors  Group  to  participate  in   and  commit  to  the  redevelopment  of  downtown  Winnipeg,  and  the  building  moved   quickly  from  an  idea  to  a  reality.    It  was  announced  in  1985  and  occupied  in  late  1987.      Eleanor  Brydone  explained,  "Art  [Mauro]  led  the  project,  his  strategic  plan  for   the  organization  drove  the  design.  The  new  building  was  to  inspire  financial  confidence.     It  was  to  reference  Winnipeg  history  and  look  to  the  future."  Brydone  spoke  of  the   clients'  desire  to  move  away  from  traditional  timber  panelling  and  benefit  from  Rice   Brydone's  experience  as  the  designers  for  the  Toronto  and  New  York  Stock  Exchanges,   Canada  Permanent  and  various  brokerage  houses  (Brydone  2013:  pers.comm.).        Investors  Group  employed  a  team  of  consultants  which  included  the  architects,   engineers,  building  contractors,  interior  designers  and  furniture  suppliers;  an  unusual   and  highly  efficient  team  who  used  an  integrated  design  process  to  move  the  project

forward.  31    Rice  Brydone  was  responsible  for  the  co-ordination  of  the  interiors  in  the   building  and  established  the  space  requirements  and  protocols  for  office  size  and   allocation  after  carrying  out  an  extensive  survey  of  each  employee's  workspace  and   equipment.  The  survey  of  575  IG  employees  formed  the  basis  for  establishing  norms  for   workspaces  that  were  generous  and  exceeded  the  ergonomic  requirements  considered   standard  at  the  time.32  "It  was  the  third  largest  survey  ever  undertaken  by  organizers   Steelcase  Ltd  and  Business  Furnishings"  (n.a.  1986:  7:2).        Anita  Jones,  the  site  manager  for  Rice  Brydone,  remembers  that  the  consistency   of  office  sizes  was  unusual  for  the  time.  Attention  to  the  users'  needs  lead  to  the   development  of  small  private  offices  with  a  "work  wall"  dividing  them,  and  assistant   managers  were  allowed  to  determine  the  layout  of  their  own  offices.    The  work  wall  was   also  employed  in  the  manager's  offices  where  the  power  and  telephone  cabling  and   storage  elements  such  as  a  coat  cupboard  and  filing  storage  were  located.  The  desk   could  then  be  chosen  to  suit  the  occupant,  and  some  managers'  offices  had  tables   rather  than  a  more  formal  desk.    This  was  a  significantly  different  approach  for  the  time   (Jones  2010:  pers.  comm.).  Managers  were  encouraged  to  participate  in  the  selection  of   furniture  and  the  configuration  of  their  offices,  reflecting  an  acceptance  of  the  everyday   experience  of  the  employees  at  Investors  Group  and  a  desire  for  flexibility  and  the   capacity  to  accommodate  change,  all  qualities  that  the  design  team  brought  to  the   project  of  the  new  headquarters  building.  These  new  ways  of  thinking  about  the  design   of  office  spaces,  can  be  traced  back  to  the  early  process  work  of  the  Knoll  Planning  Unit,   where  all  employees  were  considered  important  in  the  satisfactory  resolution  of  a   planning  problem.        Inconsistencies  in  position,  rank  and  spatial  allocations  inherited  from  280   Broadway  were  adjusted  to  provide  more  equitable  working  conditions  for  all  staff.   Rice  Brydone  suggested  moving  away  from  a  typical  floor  with  offices  lined  up  around   the  perimeter  and  a  bullpen  for  the  clerical  employees;  offices  were  grouped  together                                                                                                                    31  "The  Cornerstone",  October  1990  Vol  12,  no  9.   32  Art  Mauro  personal  communication.        87  

  
with  smaller  clerical  workstation  clusters  located  around  them.33  The  main  objective  for   the  project  was  to  achieve  a  better  quality  of  air  and  light  for  the  employees,  so  much  of   the  floor  plate  at  each  level  was  open  at  the  windows,  housing  workstations.    Typically   the  South  side  of  each  floor  is  planned  with  a  meeting  room  or  two  and  the  offices  of   managers  for  the  units  located  on  the  floor.      Many  employees  were  relocated  from  offices  to  workstations  in  the  open  area.     To  ease  concerns  about  privacy  higher  screens  and  wider  circulation  routes  were   provided  to  create  more  acoustic  separation  for  these  employees.     A  five-foot-wide  corridor  encircles  all  floors  with  private  offices  located  on  the   outside  perimeters.    Common  work  areas  are  located  near  windows,  to  allow  the   flow  of  natural  light.    Two  large  meeting  rooms  and  a  large  reception  area  give   each  floor  spacious  comfort.      The  carpet  in  the  main  lobbies  are  a  blend  of   colours,  with  each  floor  picking  up  one  of  the  five  colours  in  its  granite,  chairs,   carpet  and  possibly  even  table-tops.    Workstations  are  standardized,  according   to  job  function.    A  manager's  office  takes  up  200  square  feet,  but  it  doesn't   necessarily  incorporate  standard  office  furniture.    For  maximum  flexibility  some   offices  are  built  of  drywall,  others  of  easily  moveable,  functional  and  private,   acoustic  [work  walls].  Opening  or  closing  one  or  both  panels  lets  you  be   completely  open  or  unavailable  to  visitors.    Built  into  the  [work  walls]  are   bookshelves,  filing  units  or  coat  racks.    The  goal  is  to  use  space  effectively.    The   floor  plans  are  designed  to  accommodate  changes  and  growth.       (The  Cornerstone  1986:  3)   Worthington  (1988)  advocates  for  wide  corridors  as  an  alternative  to  private  offices   allowing  for  occupants  of  cubicles  to  hold  private  conversations  without  being   overheard.  Today  a  more  typical  solution  would  be  artificial  sound  (white  or  pink  noise)   used  to  conceal  conversations  in  open  office  areas.         Clerical  Workstations      The  design  of  the  open  office  space  was  typical  of  the  office  typology  of  the   1980s.    It  had  suspended  acoustic  ceiling  tiles  with  flush  mounted  fluorescent  light   fittings  and  fitted  carpets,  the  perimeter  windows  that  provided  daylight  into  the  space   were  large  fixed  windows  with  venetian  blinds  for  light  control.

   The  layout  of  the  clerical  workstations  on  each  floor  of  IG  was  developed  by   Insite,  the  furniture  contractor  for  the  project  and  approved  by  Rice  Brydone.  The   amount  of  consideration  given  to  individual  needs  would  have  been  based  on  the   employee  survey  and  the  development  of  standard  workstation  configurations,  but   clerical  employees  would  not  have  had  a  say  in  the  type  of  furniture  selected  or  their   preferred  working  configuration.  In  the  financial  services  industry  clerical  workers  are   often  contract  employees  and  considered  replaceable.  Their  workspaces  are  subject  to   higher  levels  of  churn,  as  teams  are  assembled  and  broken  up  as  seasonal  work  flows   through  the  offices.    Workstations  for  routine  clerical  workers  at  IG  are  Steelcase  L- shaped  desks  where  the  computer  screen  is  most  often  accommodated  in  the  crook  of   the  L,  acoustic  panels  modules  are  generally  42"  high  by  30  "to  45  "wide  giving  some   definition  to  the  boundaries  of  the  individual's  workspace.    This  height  allows  very  little   visual  privacy  and  is  used  in  areas  where  team  working  is  encouraged  or  required.  The   workstations  of  the  women  clerical  workers  are  larger  on  the  sixth  floor  than  the  second   floor.  All  desks  are  70"  by  30"  and  spatial  allocations  are  a  total  area  of  46.8  square  feet   on  the  sixth  floor,  on  the  second  floor  39  square  feet  is  typical.    The  most  desirable   locations  in  workstation  configurations  are  usually  at  the  ends  of  a  row,  where  a  window   wall  creates  a  more  private  space  or  a  corridor  provides  more  social  interaction.          Higher  screens  and  banks  of  filing  storage  are  often  used  to  define  the   boundaries  of  team  areas.    Access  to  client  and  project  files  became  more  functionally   distributed  at  this  time,  in  alignment  with  greater  availability  of  information  critical  to   the  operation  of  units.  The  management  of  paper  was  a  big  issue  at  Investors  Group,  as   it  was  in  many  other  organizations  before  the  advent  of  floppy  disks  and  CDs.  Banks  of   filing  had  to  be  located  on  the  structural  grid  or  extra  reinforcement  was  required  to  be   included  into  the  floor  slab.  Filing  cabinets  and  storage  furniture  is  beige,  carpets  are   neutral,  and  the  environment  is  flooded  with  natural  light  that  has  to  be  managed  with   venetian  blinds  on  the  east,  south  and  west  facades.    This  means  the  view  is  often   obscured  or  completely  shut  out,  defeating  the  best  intentions  of  the  organization  to   provide  natural  light  for  employees.          89  

  
   The  clerical  spaces  are  drab  and  cluttered,  lacking  focal  variation,  colour  or   interest.    The  service  areas  such  as  meeting  rooms  and  lunchrooms  that  were  provided   when  the  building  was  designed  are  now  too  small  or  have  outlived  their  original   purpose.    Meeting  rooms  are  too  formally  located  on  the  plan  to  encourage  impromptu   meetings  and  the  lunchroom  is  a  small  space  that  would  only  accommodate  a  few   employees  at  one  time.  The  provision  of  these  ancillary  spaces  was  quite  innovative  at   the  time  the  building  was  designed  and  their  purpose  was  to  encourage  team  working   and  regular  meetings  that  would  improve  internal  communications.    Placing  a   lunchroom  on  each  floor  allowed  employees  to  take  a  break  when  it  was  convenient   rather  than  a  scheduled  time.    There  is  a  telephone  room  that  is  rarely  used  now.  It  is  a   windowless  room  the  size  of  a  closet  where  a  phone  was  provided  for  personal  calls.   This  was  necessary  because  many  clerical  employees  have  desks  without  access  to  a   phone  and  taking  personal  calls  during  working  hours  is  not  encouraged      Criticism  of  the  Interiors      In  his  article  in  the  Winnipeg  Free  Press,  at  the  time  the  building  was  opened,   architecture  critic  Jonas  Lehrman  dismisses  the  Investors  Group  building  as  pompous   and  out  of  place  in  Winnipeg,  but  he  saves  his  sharpest  critique  for  the  interiors  of  the   building.  "The  decor  of  the  executive  areas,  selected  by  a  firm  of  interior  designers   largely  independent  of  the  architects,  seems  to  revert  to  a  nouveau  riche  eclecticism   that  by  comparison  makes  the  exterior  of  the  building  seem  positively  risky"  (Lehman   1987).   Lehrman's  concern  is  two-fold;  he  perceives  the  interiors  were  not  the  work  of  the   building  architects,  breaking  with  the  established  tradition  in  modernist  architecture.  He   also  asserts  that  the  architectural  aesthetic  is  not  carried  into  the  interiors;  which  would   have  been  reflected  with  more  contemporary  furniture  and  finishes.  He  was,  no  doubt,   surprised  to  find  traditional  furniture,  juxtaposed  with  contemporary  art  and  a  pastel   colour  scheme  on  the  executive  floors  (see  Appendix  2).  He  didn't  comment  at  all  on  the   configuration  of  the  open  office  areas.      90  

  
     In  my  opinion,  the  two  executive  floors  strongly  reflect  1980s  post-modernity,   with  references  to  classical  form  and  detailing  in  elements  such  as  the  oversized  dentil   mouldings  at  the  cornice,  proportions  of  the  door  openings  and  the  symmetrical   planning  of  floor  layouts.    These  classical  references  are  contrasted  with  a  palette  of   pastel  hues  in  wall  colours,  details,  and  textiles  with  contemporary  painting  and   sculpture  that  evoke  a  lighter  and  less  masculine  environment  that  is  also  a  feature  of   the  postmodern  office  design  of  the  period.  Leone  Glenat,  a  young  designer  working  for   Insite  Design  at  the  time,  remembers:       A  year  or  so  after  the  Investors  project  was  completed  Eleanor  Brydone  told  me   that  their  inspiration  [for  the  colour  palette]  for  the  interior  design  was  based  on   Manitoba  sunsets.    Eleanor  said  that  when  she  and  her  design  team  came  to   Winnipeg,  they  were  amazed  at  the  colors  of  the  sunset  skies  and  incorporated   these  colors  into  their  concept  for  the  interior.    This  explains  the  original  finishes   on  the  18th  and  19th  executive  floors,  which  had  an  abundance  of  lilacs,  as  well  as   reds  and  light  and  dark  greens.      The  remaining  floors  had  white  wood  desktops   and  tables  but  the  wood  pedestals,  chair  fabrics  and  carpet  inlays  were  different   colours  on  each  floor.      There  was  a  green  floor,  red  floor,  purple  floor,  yellow   floor  and  an  orange  floor.      As  there  were  originally  ten  non-executive  floors  that   Investors  occupied,  Rice  Brydone  repeated  these  floor  colors  on  the  remaining   five  floors.    In  the  open  office,  the  Insite  team  continued  with  this  concept  and   selected  white  furniture  systems  with  tackboards  and  chairs  in  the  color  theme   of  the  floor.  (Glenat  2012)  

     

The  Executive  Floors   The  executives  occupy  the  19th  floor  with  the  CEO  and  the  chairman's  offices.   The  boardroom  and  the  dining  room  were  located  on  the  18th  floor.  These  spaces  were   designed  to  provide  a  "quiet  elegance"34  with  traditional  furniture  in  a  contemporary   environment  accented  by  exotic  timber  furniture  and  doors  and  specially  commissioned   rugs  from  Israel.    Today  the  Investors  Group  art  collection,  representing  many  significant   contemporary  Canadian  artists,  is  displayed  through  out  the  building,  including  the   newly  renovated  cafeteria.        The  executive  offices,  designed  by  Rice  Brydone,  assumed  a  warmer,  less  formal   aesthetic  than  their  previous  timber  panelled  space,  providing  more  colour  and  comfort,

luxury  and  softness  than  was  typical  of  the  workplace  during  the  modernist  period.  The   public  interiors  on  the  19th  floor  provide  elegant  and  quite  spare  spaces  that  reference   the  conservative  traditions  of  the  banking  industry  but  with  a  less  gendered  frame  of   reference.    Executive  offices  were  furnished  to  suit  the  taste  of  the  individuals   concerned  and  most  often  contained  traditional  dark  wood  desks  and  bookshelves  with   wing  back  chairs  for  lounge  seating,  which  may  have  been  reused  from  the  Broadway   offices.    Seating  in  the  public  spaces  of  the  executive  floors  are  contemporary  club  chairs   with  button  tufting,  upholstered  in  lilac  grey  leather.    They  are  juxtaposed  with  drum   tables  of  dark  walnut  timber  with  white  marble  tops  (see  Appendix  2  for  images  of  the   executive  floors).          The  proportions  of  the  space  emphasize  the  horizontal,  with  artwork  placed   quite  low  on  the  walls  and  door  openings  framed  by  the  strong  horizontal  dentil  banding   at  the  ceiling.    A  suggestion  of  columns  is  created  to  frame  larger  openings  by  the   placement  of  vertical  moulding  and  emphasis  with  a  darker  paint  colour.    Lighting  is   generally  recessed  spot  lights.    Key  transition  zones  are  framed  at  the  ceiling  to  create   an  atrium  effect  with  a  wash  of  concealed  light,  giving  the  space  atmospheric  variations   of  lighting  levels.    A  similar  ceiling  detail  is  created  in  each  lift  lobby  and  on  the  walnut   floors  beautiful  custom  designed  rugs  announce  the  two  executive  levels.        The  secretarial  units  located  outside  the  senior  executive  offices  were  custom   designed  workstations  that  included  built-in  filing  storage,  desks  and  low-height   partitions  all  finished  in  pastel  colours  reflecting  the  wall  colours.  They  were  topped   with  pyramidal  forms  that  that  created  quite  heavy  design  elements,  and  stopped  the   accumulation  of  files  or  plants.  It  is  interesting  to  muse  about  their  design  of  these  units   and  who  it  was  thought  to  serve.  Was  this  a  request  from  the  senior  executives  or  a   designer's  idea  of  a  method  for  controlling  the  accumulation  of  visual  clutter  in  these   prominent  workspaces?    The  workstations  were  designed  for  the  women  whose  jobs   were  to  support  and  attend  to  the  needs  of  the  male  executives.    As  their  roles  and  their   numbers  diminished  with  the  onset  of  technology  some  of  the  workstations  were

removed.    It  seemed  that  they  were  the  least  successful  aspects  of  the  interior   designers'  concept  and  they  were  replaced  with  very  traditional  dark  timber  furniture.        A  recurring  square  grid  detail  references  the  external  façade  of  the  building.    It  is   found  in  the  pattern  of  squares  in  the  lobby  rugs,  the  dentil  moulding  at  the  ceiling,  the   coffering  in  the  boardroom  ceiling  and  above  the  open  stair  connecting  the  executive   floors.  The  square  motif  reinforces  the  postmodern  design  language  of  simple  geometric   forms  that  are  used  consistently  in  the  building.        Typical  Floors         The  floors  17  and  below  also  reference  a  postmodern  architectural  language  by   using  materials  and  detailing  compatible  with  the  simple  geometry  of  the  building.  The   elevator  lobbies  are  designed  to  present  a  consistent  image  to  the  visitor  with  only  the   principle  accent  colour  varying.    The  plan  is  repeated  from  floor  to  floor.  The  reception   area  is  located  on  the  south  side  of  the  building  and  has  built-in  bench  seating,  a   reception  counter  and  noticeboard.  The  focal  point  of  the  Lobby  space  is  daylight   filtered  through  the  glass  screen  wall  of  the  meeting  room  positioned  to  enjoy  views  to   the  south  of  the  Winnipeg  Art  Gallery  and  the  Legislature.    The  consistency  of  the   planning  creates  legibility  for  users  and  visitors  to  the  building,  and  conceals  staff   facilities  such  as  a  telephone  room,  a  small  kitchen  and  a  small  meeting  room.      The   reception  areas  are  largely  unused  now  due  to  the  changes  in  security  systems  in  the   building.    When  the  building  was  opened  they  would  have  served  as  gateways  to  the   business  of  each  floor,  a  job  that  has  been  subsumed  by  technology  in  the  form  of  the   security  cards  issued  to  employees  and  visitors  that  determine  their  access  to  each  floor   via  the  building  elevators.

   A  walkway  link  on  the  third  floor  provides  access  to  the  Portage  Place  Mall  to   enable  employees  to  shop,  bank,  or  go  to  the  YMCA  in  their  lunch  hour.  This  was  a  shift   in  culture.  In  the  previous  building  on  Broadway,  the  tradition  had  been  for  a  common   morning  and  afternoon  break  with  almost  all  employees  gathering  in  the  cafeteria,   creating  an  unusually  cohesive  bond  amongst  staff  and  a  particularly  familiar  culture.     David  Archer,  former  Executive  Vice-President  of  Investments  and  Trusts,  was  pleased   to  see  this  feature  of  Investors  Group  culture  give  way  to  a  more  flexible  schedule   where  employees  could  take  time  for  appointments  and  parental  responsibilities  and   breaks  were  staggered  to  give  coverage  in  each  department  for  the  whole  day.  (Archer   2012:  pers.comm.)      State  of  Art  for  the  Investment  Industry     Design  changed  the  culture  of  Investors  bringing  the  company  head  offices  into   line  with  the  state  of  the  art  for  the  investment  industry.     (Tyshynski  2012:  pers.comm)      Broadgate  London,  a  30-acre  development  site  owned  by  the  British  Land   Corporation,  was  under  construction  at  the  same  time  as  IG's  new  building  (1985-90).  It   was  commissioned  by  the  City  of  London  and  designed  by  Arup  and  Associates  and   Skidmore  Owings  and  Merrill.    It  houses  London's  financial  services  industries.  Duffy   (1997)  asserts  that  its  distinguishing  features  were  extensive  market  and  user  research   that  informed  the  design,  and  a  particular  focus  on  office  technology  and  its  impact  on   the  demand  for  office  space.    The  design  was  arranged  around  a  series  of  urban  squares,   creating  a  significant  impact  on  the  urban  environment.    The  buildings  were  configured   as  clusters  of  groundscrapers  giving  the  occupants  unprecedented  access  to  natural   light,  open  plaza  space  and  facilities  such  as  shopping,  restaurants  and  entertainment.     Duffy  suggests  this  project  set  "the  highest  international  standards  for  accommodating   the  emerging  needs  of  the  financial  services  industry"(1997).  It  provides  an  early   example  of  the  convergence  of  new  urban  planning  theories,  neoliberal  public/private   funding  models,  and  ways  of  working  that  are  dependant  on  new  communication      96  

  
technologies.  It  most  certainly  reflected  the  "space  of  flows"  Castells  (2000)  was  writing   about  at  the  time.  In  many  significant  ways  the  issues  that  preoccupied  the  designers  of   the  huge  Broadgate  complex  were  also  of  concern  to  the  architects  and  designers  who   designed  One  Canada  Centre.    The  project  was  initially  conceived  of  as  an  urban   intervention,  part  of  a  larger  plan  to  renew  the  vitality  of  the  downtown.  The  project   ensured  connections  to  the  larger  urban  environment  providing  facilities  for  employees   such  as  walkways  to  the  Portage  Place  Mall,  with  links  to  the  Bay  and  the  Eaton's   Centre,  underground  car  parking,  and  convenient  access  to  transportation  through  the   provision  of  a  bus  shelter  in  front  of  the  building,  on  Portage  Ave.      The  building  has  a   small  footprint,  breaking  with  the  traditional  deep  space  planning  of  North  America,  and   offers  occupants  maximum  access  to  natural  light  with  continuous  windows  on  all  faces   of  the  building.      One  Canada  Centre  provided  exceptional  environmental  conditions  for  the  time   with  a  computer-monitored  heating,  ventilating  and  air  conditioning  system  with  25   zones  per  floor.    The  old  building  on  Broadway  had  only  two  zones  per  floor,  leading  to   cold  spots.  Oversized  perimeter  cable  raceways  allowed  for  inevitable  changes  to  occur   for  growth  and  restructuring,  and  the  communications  technology  provided  to  the   building  was  the  state  of  the  art.      Training  facilities  were  located  on  the  third  floor  along  with  the  cafeteria.    The   facilities  incorporated  two  training  rooms  for  30  persons  that  were  sound  isolated  and   equipped  with  14  computers  each,  in  addition  to  a  "data  processing  education  complex"   for  training  head  office  processors  "and  anyone  else  in  Head  Office  that  uses  a   terminal"35.    In  1987  the  company  could  not  foresee  the  reach  of  the  revolution  in   workstyles  that  would  be  instigated  by  desktop  computing,  but  they  recognized  the   needs  to  develop  the  skills  in  their  workforce  to  support  the  new  technologies.      Extensive  user  consultation  was  a  hallmark  of  the  One  Canada  Centre  project,   allowing  for  the  development  of  more  equitable  allocation  of  workspaces.  The  plan   determining  the  co-location  of  departments  (called  the  stacking  plan)  was  developed  by

Rice  Brydone  in  conjunction  with  the  heads  of  each  department.    New  Steelcase  systems   furniture  replaced  the  "metal  tanks"  that  had  served  as  desks  in  the  Broadway  location   and  the  offices  were  planned  to  provide  air  quality  and  good  levels  of  daylight  and  views   for  workers  and  to  provide  the  ambience  of  a  "head  office".      The  air  conditioning  system  was  designed  to  allow  optimal  comfort  levels  for   offices  and  the  open  work  area.  Managers'  offices  were  provided  with  built-in  storage   and  a  choice  of  desk  type;  their  spaces  were  designed  to  be  open  to  employees  most  of   the  time.    A  lunch  room  was  located  on  each  floor  equipped  with  a  fridge  and  sink  that   allowed  employees  to  take  a  break  at  any  time  during  the  day.  Meeting  room  facilities   were  introduced  at  each  floor  and  were  located  to  provide  places  for  employees  and   clients  to  meet  within  the  reception  zone  on  each  floor.  The  CEO  recognized  the   importance  of  the  new  building  as  a  tool  for  self-promotion  and  pride  for  head  office   staff,  but  also  for  training  visiting  regional  sales  staff  and  advisors.  Investors  Group   wanted  employees  to  have  pride  in  the  new  offices  and  modern  amenities  and  by   association  the  company.36A  brochure  was  produced  to  promote  the  building  to  all   employees.      Organizational  change      Organizational  theory  at  the  time  (Drucker  1985)  predicted  a  transition  to   greater  numbers  of  managers  and  professionals  (knowledge  workers),  and  less  clerical   staff,  with  an  attendant  need  for  more  meeting  spaces  to  allow  for  greater  information   sharing  and  informal  conversations.  Worthington  suggests  the  new  class  of  knowledge   worker  spends  more  time  in  meetings,  so  the  size  of  the  office  cubicle  is  less  important   (Klein  1982:234).          But  the  clerical  workers'  jobs  didn't  decrease  substantially  in  number,  and  in   many  organizations  in  the  1980s  male  middle  managers  lost  their  jobs  instead.  The   office  was  subjected  to  increased  change  and  churn,  as  small  responsive  teams  were   assembled  to  carry  out  a  project  or  task,  and  dispersed  when  the  task  was  completed.    
  

                                                                                                                 98  

  

  
Greater  numbers  of  women  were  employed  as  clerical  staff.  The  skills  they  brought  in   terms  of  their  capacity  for  collaboration  and  their  ability  to  adapt  to  change,  and   accommodate  flexible  ways  of  operating  have  benefitted  the  office,  facilitating  the  new   ways  of  operating  required  by  globalization  and  technology.          As  clerical  jobs  grew  in  number  and  were  filled  by  more  women,  the  status  of  the   work  was  devalued.  More  opportunities  were  created  for  educated  immigrant  women   to  occupy  routine  clerical  jobs  at  an  even  smaller  pay  scale.  The  shift  from  male  to   female  clerical  workers  in  evidence  in  the  1980s  facilitated  a  new  organizational  culture   that  focussed  on  the  skills  and  ways  of  working  that  were  in  alignment  with  women's   values.  Women's  capacity  for  collaboration  and  teamwork  was  often  employed  at  the   expense  of  personal  privacy,  women's  acceptance  of  change  and  flexibility  was  often  at   the  expense  of  secure  employment  and  regular  hours  of  work.    The  case  studies   represented  in  Chapters  Six  will  study  the  close  environments  of  women  clerical  workers   at  IG  and  explore  how  they  represent  their  values  in  the  "feminized"  office  space.          The  1980s  were  the  time  when  the  interior  design  profession  was  consolidating   its  role  and  the  numbers  of  graduates  from  interiors  programs  were  growing.    As  a  result   more  women  were  involved  in  the  design  of  offices  as  planners,  facilities  designers  and   as  employees  of  the  burgeoning  office  furniture  industry.  They  brought  with  them  an   acknowledgement  of  life  and  experience  and  the  value  of  everyday  life,  which  enabled   the  design  of  new  office  space  to  potentially  be  recast,  to  implicitly  reflect  the  greater   valuing  of  the  feminine.  This  was  a  moment  of  optimism  about  the  potential  of  design.      Organizations  such  as  IG  did  not  provide  the  employees  with  day  care  for  their   children  or  telephones  at  every  desk  to  allow  employees  to  be  in  contact  with  their   families.  But  there  was  recognition  of  the  need  to  make  the  work  environment  appear   to  welcome  women  and  express  a  sincere  desire  to  create  a  contemporary  workplace   that  functioned  in  a  more  communicative  and  collaborative  manner  in  line  with   organizational  theory  of  the  time.

CHAPTER  FIVE  

  

NARRATIVES  AND  VISUAL  COMPOSITES  
Introduction   Entering  the  lobby  of  One  Canada  Centre,  the  sun  streams  into  the  three   volume  space  through  the  curved  glass  façade.   The  building  is  a  modest  19  floors,   scaled  to  the  needs  of  the  organization  and  the  skyline  of  Winnipeg.  The  vestibule   that  creates  an  airlock  at  the  entrance  is  human  scaled  in  contrast  to  the  height  of   this  space,  modelled  on  the  vertical  banking  chambers  typical  of  larger  office  towers.   The  height  of  the  space  is  emphasized  by  Warren  Carther's  soaring  glass  sculpture   "Prairie  Boy's  Dream"  (1994),  installed  so  it  contains  the  view  through  the  space  to   the  elevators.    On  the  right  framed  by  a  wall  of  imposing  red  Texan  granite  is  a  large   desk  and  the  concierge  who  greets  everyone  and  seems  to  know  the  names  of  every   IG  employee.   He  has  a  security  badge  waiting  for  me  and  directs  me  to  the  seating   area  to  wait  for  my  appointed  contact.    Obviously  waiting  is  not  something  Investors   Group  expects  of  their  visitors  ­  there  are  only  four  club  chairs  and  as  I  sit  and  look   up  into  the  volume,  I  realize  the  upper  level  offices  and  cafeteria  have  views  down   into  the  lobby.   The  curved  wall  terminates  against  the  vertical  wall  of  the  façade  at   the  third  floor,  with  a  glazed  atrium  bringing  even  more  light  into  this  south  facing   lobby.    It  is  a  generous  volume  that  creates  the  impression  of  the  importance  of   Investors  Group.  I  am  drawn  to  Carther's  glass  installation  with  its  glowing  honed  and   textured  surface  representing  the  topography  of  the  prairies  in  blues  and  muted   greens.   Roberta  has  arrived  to  take  me  to  her  office  and  I  wait  with  her  for  the  first   elevator  to  take  us  up  into  the  building.      The  lift  lobby  walls  and  floor  are  polished  red  granite,  and  the  curved  ceiling  is  

  

lit  from  sconces  built  into  the  granite  walls.  The  lift  is  obviously  not  from  the  time  the   building  was  first  designed;  it  is  sleek  and  stainless  steel  and  a  voice  welcomes  us  to   Investors  Group.   Each  floor  has  a  similar  plan  form,  bringing  visitors  to  the  south  side      101  

  
of  the  building  where  meeting  rooms  and  managers'  offices  are  located.  They  have   been  designed  to  transfer  as  much  light  as  possible  from  the  perimeter  to  the  core   with  opaque  glazing  to  the  meeting  rooms  and  large  openings  into  the  managers'   offices.   The  style  references  post-modern  detailing,  but  the  integrity  of  the     design  has  been  maintained  with  the  original  colour  schemes  from  the  late  1980s   intact.  Roberta's  office  is  large  enough  to  comfortably  accommodate  a  small  meeting   table  for  three  placed  away  from  her  desk.  It  is  a  thoughtfully  designed  space  and  still   seems  to  serve  its  function  well.   I  sit  so  I  have  a  view  out  to  Memorial  Drive,  the  Winnipeg  Art  Gallery  and  the   Bay.  Pondering  the  vista,  I  remember  Art  Mauro's  comments  about  the  siting  of  the   building  so  the  chairman's  office  would  face  the  centre  of  power  in  the  province,  the   Legislative  building.  Roberta  and  I  discuss  the  research  and  how  it  will  unfold.  IG   does  not  want  the  interviews  to  take  place  at  the  women's  desks  as  this  might  cause   interruptions  to  the  other  workers,  so  I  will  set  up  appointments  to  meet  with  each   participant.   I  ask  to  see  the  office  space  where  the  women  work  and  she  arranges  for  a   tour  of  the  sixth  floor.  It  has  the  typical  plan  with  the  1980s  reception  and  meeting   spaces  on  the  south  elevation.   There  are  a  number  of  smaller  managers'  offices  and   the  space  opens  into  a  large  open  office  area  with  beige  regimented  workstations.  The   space  has  an  abundance  of  natural  light  that  the  occupants  screen  out  with  venetian   blinds,  and  some  are  closed  completely  against  the  sun.   The  space  is  busy,  desks  are   full  and  the  occupants,  mostly  women,  are  engrossed  in  their  work.  A  few  look  up   curiously.  At  first  appearance  there  is  little  personalization  at  the  desks,  but  as  I  look   more  closely  at  the  tidy  desks  the  personalia  becomes  more  obvious.               102

      Context  for  the  research   The  two  groups  that  were  approached  to  volunteer  participants  are  part  of  Client   Services  at  Investors  Group.    This  department  provides  services  to  the  IG  sales   representatives  and  individual  investors.      The  Registered  Educational  Savings  Plan  (RESP)  processors  and  account   administrators  on  level  two  prepare  the  required  paperwork  for  clients  and  perform   financial  adjustments  during  the  RESP  season  and  for  annual  assessments.   The  Mutual  Group  on  level  six  prepare  the  documentation  for  IG's  Mutual  investment   products  and  deal  with  the  required  paperwork  for  clients  Registered  Retirement   Savings  Plan  investments.      Verdonck  ­Milne  suggests  the  work  requires  business  knowledge  and  skills  and   is  not  the  work  for  an  entry-level  position  (Verdonck  2015:  pers.comm.).  The  work  is   performed  by  mainly  by  salaried  clerical  workers  at  IG  but  contract  staff  is  employed  in   the  peak  tax  season.    She  estimates  the  proportion  of  women  employed  in  Client   Services  to  be  74%  of  the  total  staff  numbers.        The  subjects  of  the  research  are  women  who  perform  routine  clerical  work  at   dedicated  desks  in  office  cubicles  for  seven  to  ten  hours  a  day.  Their  roles  as  processors   do  not  involve  direct  contact  with  the  public.    Five  women  work  on  the  sixth  floor  in  the   RESP  department  and  are  responsible  for  RESP  processing  and  account  administration.   The  other  six  women  work  on  the  second  floor  in  accounts  processing  and  mutual  funds   administration.    Six  of  the  study  participants  are  Canadians,  four  are  immigrants  from   the  Philippines,  and  one  is  from  Indonesia.    (relocated  )      The  research  process  and  selection  of  subjects,  along  with  the  questions  that   form  the  framework  for  the  interviews,  were  developed  early  in  the  process  as  part  of   the  information  provided  for  Ethics  approval.    The  subjects  were  approached  by  IG  from   routine  clerical  workers  in  the  Client  Services  department;  group  leaders  called  for   volunteers  after  an  information  sheet  describing  the  research  had  been  circulated.      106  

  
Twelve  volunteers  names  were  provided  to  me,  only  one  volunteer  was  male.    The   volunteers  had  agreed  to  allow  their  desks  to  be  photographed  and  to  participate  in  an   interview  about  the  nature  of  their  personalia.    The  process  I  used  was  to  make  an   appointment  to  visit  each  desk  when  it  was  unoccupied  to  take  photographs.    The   photographs  were  taken  mainly  from  the  perspective  of  a  seated  person,  ranging   around  the  desk,  then  close-up  shots  to  examine  detail  and  arrangement,   approximately  15  ­  20  images  of  each  desk,  depending  on  the  number  of  artefacts   present.  The  gendered  structure  of  the  financial  services  industry  was  very  apparent  in   the  sample  of  subjects  I  was  able  to  work  with,  I  determined  to  use  this  as  focus  of  the   research  and  removed  the  male  subject  from  the  sample.      The  interviews  were  scheduled  two  weeks  later,  in  meeting  rooms  on  the   second  and  sixth  floors.    Each  interview  used  the  questionnaire  format  as  a  loose   framework  for  the  discussion  of  the  desk  and  its  personalia.  Follow  up  questions   allowed  me  to  pursue  areas  of  interest  that  developed  as  the  interview  proceeded.   Interviews  were  approximately  45  minutes  to  one  hour  in  duration.    The  photographs   provided  the  background  for  the  interviews  and  I  observed  that  the  subjects  were   moved  to  make  extended  observations  about  their  personalia  prompted  by  the  images   on  my  laptop.      The  photographs  acted  as  authentication  of  the  personal  artefacts  at  the  desk,   the  subjects  took  the  interviews  quite  seriously  and  as  our  conversations  progressed   stories  of  the  social  significance  of  the  personalia  at  the  desk  unfolded.          The  following  narratives  were  written  as  a  reflection  on  the  interview   conversation  and  to  capture  the  women's  voices.  Accordingly,  the  narratives  do  not   reflect  the  complete  content  of  my  field  notes  or  photographic  records,  but  rather   attempt  to  capture  the  essence  of  the  women  at  their  desks,  their  operations  and   practices,  values  and  identities.               107

Gloria is in her early 60s and has been employed at IG for

ten years. She has spent six years at this location and desk which she describes as her "home away from home". She is looking forward to retiring in a few years and expresses her frustration with her desk chair as it is not comfortable to sit in all day. Her arthritis means she needs to get up and move around periodically to stretch. Gloria is also having hearing problems that allow her to more easily tune out the office environment. She works with her back to the team as her desk is positioned against the windows with the venetian blinds closed. She is in a loosely defined team that shares peer support for the individual projects that require particular expertise.  Gloria says she has personalized the space on her desk for her own benefit. She defines her work as routine and likes it that way. When I ask if she is looking forward to her retirement, she replies, "Yes, I don't want to learn anymore; no new systems or new programs."

Gloria

The personal items on her desk are important to her. "[They]

make it my station, those who have nothing on their desks ... it seems so sterile." She tells me the days are long and she needs to make the space feel personal. The display is also a good conversation starter when co-workers first join the unit, and she doesn't mind anyone looking at the things on her desk. Gloria often gets asked about a set of eyeballs on the top edge of the panels that enclose her workstation. These "extra eyes" were made by her granddaughter at daycare, giving her "eyeballs in the back of my head". They seem to say "I know what you are doing, if you are watching me, I am watching you too".  Gloria sees the things at her desk as providing "stories to tell others in the workplace". She has a picture with a story in a prominent location on her pin board. It is a castle in Scotland that her mother's family surrendered in the 1940s for unpaid estate  taxes. She brought it in to show a work colleague and left it pinned up to dream about. There are a number of hand-crafted tchotchkas made by one of her granddaughters at Girl Guides. One is a felt cutout cow that says "Girl guides is udderly awesome", as well as a robot man hanging ornament made from beads. Her grandson has given her a number of small toys he made from Kinder Surprise because he knew she had things made by her granddaughters at her desk. They are displayed alongside the play dough critters on the top edge of her workstation.

110



Clustered around the computer screen are personal and

practical items, such as hand cream, and office supplies: sticky notes, marker pens, a stapler, paper clips, pens and pencils. Office supplies have currency at IG, so employees collect and horde them. The supplies are often located in the crook of the space below the screen, safe from being borrowed or pilfered. Gloria is clear about this. "Don't anybody come and move my stuff, I know where everything is on my desk!' saying she is "fussy that way".  There are markers of activities organized by the company, including a memento of a donation made to an Alzheimer's fundraiser, and stickers from United Way and Cancer Care Manitoba. Gloria has two red remembrance poppies to honour "family who fought over there". Her desk is very tidy, as she explains she doesn't have much paperwork because it is too hard to keep track of paper and it looks messy, so she keeps any paper in files on the desk. She is proud that she knows where everything is at her desk.  There is a poem pinned to her desk that she thinks was given to her by a retiring IG friend. She usually has pictures of her grandchildren on her pin board but she took them down for the research photography session.  Gloria talks about things accumulating at her desk over the years, but as she has occupied the same location for six years the desk is remarkably tidy and clean. This may be due to her allergy to dust mites that requires her to clean the surface of her desk regularly. Gloria's tidy desk gives her a sense of familiarity and control.

Sharon has worked for IG for 18 years. She has four more

years to retirement and has had triple bypass surgery. She has been in this department for four years and has been sitting at this desk for all that time. The desk opens onto an aisle but has higher panels separating it from the next row of desks.  When I raise the issue of privacy, Sharon says she doesn't use earphones but "just blocks it out". If she has work that requires greater concentration, she "works on it early in the day or last thing at night when it is quiet". She takes her cell phone to the cafeteria if she needs to make a private call because she doesn't have a phone at her desk. Sharon emphasizes the collaborative aspects of her job, saying she collaborates "every hour of every day". Her work is routine but she performs a variety of functions that require a backup person or team leader, as "you can't possibly know all of the answers for the situation".

Sharon

112



The personalia at her desk is important to Sharon because

"it gives you a nice feeling when you're stressed, to look at it and think of that person". She speaks of the kindness of co-workers when she was in cardiac rehabilitation. Yan gave her a pedometer and Ying came to visit her. Sharon has tchochkas arranged at the top of the low panels on the right side of her desk and gives me accounts of some of her favourite items. The flower ornament in a bright shiny blue vase is solar powered and moves toward the light. It was given to her by a special co-worker and friend who now works for Liberty Tax. The black rooster from Portugal "is supposed to bring good luck", and the stuffed bears on her hard drive are from Avon. One of her co-workers sells Avon cosmetics, and for the last three years she has received them as gifts with a purchase. Sharon has a number of photos at her desk; one of herself with Santa at an IG Christmas breakfast event, and pictures of her grandchildren who don't live in the city. "I like to have them at my desk." The grandchildren's picture are on the left side of her desk located near the screen.  Sharon lives on her own with her cat, a handsome tabby who also features in the photographs. Work events are obviously an important part of Sharon's life and the event calendar is located close to her screen on the right. A display on the panel on the right-hand side includes mementos of work events; a postcard with the Jets logo on it, the Christmas photo, and an orange plastic work cone that says "way to go!" Sharon belongs to Team Awesome and the work cone is a reward from her team leader. She displays it at her desk "to show I appreciate it". The display stretches the length of the desk and return panel. Tucked behind the screen at Sharon's desk is a red rose. She explains her friends at IG gave it to her when she turned 60.  Sharon has worked overtime every evening in January, February and March. Her favourite place at IG is the newly renovated cafeteria, as it is very clean and modern looking. She takes a walk most lunchtimes through the mall next door across the skywalk to the Bay, around the second floor and back.

Perl was born in Indonesia in the 1960s. She has worked

for IG for 11 years and has been in this department for three years, spent at this desk. Her desk is located behind Molly's desk, and it is adjacent to the external window wall with low panels on her right. She explains she doesn't have a problem doing private work. "I just focus." She tells others she is working and "must not be disturbed". She is a straight-forward person who "says what I think". Perl phones her husband once each day and doesn't have a problem with private calls. She is at her desk for most of the day, taking a walk at lunchtime.  Perl's desk is clean and very tidy. She explains she doesn't like knick-knacks, has no luck with indoor plants, and "doesn't like photographs of myself". She didn't think the display of personal items was very important, and reflected on the pressure to conform. "I was pushed to have my picture taken with Santa; it reminds me of a Canadian idea of Christmas." Another photograph is tucked between the panel and her hard drive on the right side of the desk. It is a picture of her in Vietnam with her boss and a friend, and she tells me the story that accompanies this photograph. Perl worked as a systems analyst in Indonesia, taking an IBM course after high school, and was asked by her boss to go to Vietnam to set up a system with a colleague. She didn't want to go and insisted on taking a female work friend with her. This picture celebrates their time in Vietnam.

The flag mug also has a story, as it celebrates her taking

Canadian citizenship in 2004. She is "very proud to be a Canadian citizen" and it allows her to return home for a holiday every four years. She points out there are no old-age pensions in the Third World.  Another item at her desk is a red and green beaded dish made from a recycled tuna can. It says "HO HO HO" and was made by a co-worker. This is accompanied by a figurine of a Christmas gnome, and Perl says they are a reminder that Christmas is a good thing since coming to Canada.  Perl is very open about her desk and regards it as public, with "nothing secret". Her desk mostly celebrates the work she does there with shortcuts, phone contact numbers and codes taking prominence. The small number of personal items are grouped on the left side of her screen, and the right side, which is open to Molly's work area, is used for laying out files and work in progress. We talk about the food on her desk: two pickles and an avocado. Perl explains she likes to share her food. This seems to be a family tradition "coming from a family where food is not always available". Her boss from Toronto "brought fruit to my desk knowing I will share it with the others".  Perl doesn't have a favourite place at IG but her least favourite place are the washrooms at the end of the day. She has complained many times about their condition.

Molly has worked at IG for six years, five spent in this depart-

ment. She has been sitting in this location for 12 months. She was born in the Philippines in the 1960s. In the same way as her co-workers Molly dismisses the idea that it might be hard to focus working in the open space, saying "you don't let it distract you". She also has issues about the lack of privacy for personal calls, suggesting that if the hallway is busy "you might need to leave the building" to find a quiet spot for conversations. Molly's desk is clean and tidy, and while she had just taken down personal photographs, she does keep some of her children and grandchildren on her screen saver. She says the items at her desk "make my identity ­ make it my workstation" and proceeds to tell me about "the treasure" (personalia) she has collected at her desk from her friends.  Her desk is connected on three sides to other workstations, giving Molly only a small area of pin board. The front of her desk is lined with file storage, two plants, a plaque with a message celebrating friends, her coffee mug, and a collection of pens and markers neatly stored next to her stapler.

Molly
116

These possessions create a barrier between her and her neighbour on the unscreened front edge of her desk. Molly has her keyboard and screen located in the corner of the L-shaped configuration of her desk. Closest to the screen on the left-hand side is a mirror. I am curious and ask her about it. She tells me that "Filipinos always have a mirror to check their personal hygene". Next to the mirror is hand lotion and hand cleaner. Below the screen is a traveller's memento, a carved-out shell with a starfish from a friend in the Philippines, and a colourful ceramic dish with butterflies with the words "live well, laugh often and love much". There is a christening ornament sitting on the hard drive on the right side of Molly's desk with a stork and baby. It has been carefully arranged on a mirrored tile. Molly explains this is a traditional christening gift. Hovering over her workspace is a fabric sunflower with a big smiley face. This was given to her during an IG event held during the months when they are really busy; "to relieve stress", she explained.  Molly has a photocopied sheet under her keyboard explaining the 5S's, a Japanese organizational method. The 5S's advocate tidiness, orderliness, cleanliness, standardization and discipline, and were introduced to industry as part of restructuring in the 1990s. Molly brought this with her from the Philippines: "I was really inspired by that, I read it once in a while and it reminds me to take control." Molly likes to clean her desk and keep things tidy, she mentions "I get teased about it by others".  She uses the headset at her desk to listen to music "when I get bored or sleepy to wake me up". When I ask her who the display on her desk celebrates, she says work friends and family, but she is clear that she displays these artifacts and personalia for her own benefit. She has two coffee mugs at her desk because they were both gifts; one from her daughter and one from a friend for her birthday.

Amanda was born in Canada. She is in her early 40s and has

worked at IG for 11 years in total, returning to work after a four-year absence. She has worked one and a half years in her current department and location and is a team leader. Her desk is located against the windows and she sits facing her team with her back to the view. She doesn't find the work environment noisy, saying "my team is quite quiet". Amanda works later in the day on projects that require her focused attention, between 4:00 and 5:00 when the staff has gone for the day. She describes her work as "not 100 percent routine, things change from day to day". Asked about corporate policy on personalia at the desk, she reflects that "nothing deemed offensive, sexually explicit or overtly religious" would be appropriate, but doesn't recall any policing of that.  For Amanda her desk represents "my happy spot on the days that are not so good", with images of her kids' smiley faces in homemade frames. She decorates her desk for her own benefit. She is a crafter and brings projects from home with "special words, pictures of my husband and the kids". She speaks about her co-workers' enjoyment of the things she has made at her desk and "other people love to comment ".

Amanda

Relationships at work are very important to Amanda and

these are expressed when she discusses those items at her desk that have been given to her by co-workers. A button given to her by a former team when she was having a bad day says "a million pats". She speaks about the "good feelings that it evokes". She also has a large red shoe that dispenses tape and a notepad in the shape of a purse, which were also gifts from team members and co-workers. Amanda talks about "enjoying the people that I work with and that plays into my enjoyment of work". Amanda confides that she was shy at school but has grown past that.  Her desk also celebrates peers at IG and she posts a card near her screen with the photograph of another team leader's baby son, explaining that the annual dinner dance was an opportunity to get to know her peers better. The Team Incredible logo is prominently displayed at her desk; the team is an amalgamation of five former teams. Amanda had wanted to increase moral and team spirit and their competitiveness, so she used the logo from The Incredibles movie to rebrand and unite the group. She remarks with some pride, "They were a quiet team before."  At the base of Amanda's screen is a little red smurf, a devil. She describes it as "a troublemaker" that "befits my personality". It was part of a larger collection that occupied her desk until some went missing. She took the rest home but the devil returned with her. It has a special meaning but she didn't discuss the details with me.  When we evaluate the personalia at the desk, it is clear the devil and the pictures of family and friends are for her benefit, but many other items are a celebration of relationships at work, including anniversary cards from IG. It is a source of pleasure and pride to Amanda that the eight and a half years she worked at IG before resigning to have a family were recognized on her return. She displays her ten-year anniversary card and speaks about the significance of years of service in terms of benefits to employees, such as increased paid vacation time.
119

Larger milestones at IG are celebrated by teams with cake and a presentation.  The desk represents Amanda's favourite place at IG. She wants to be approachable to others and understands the significance of personal items at the desk as a conversation starter. She has a pad of pink sticky notes with her name printed on them, a gift of recognition from IG. As she relates the story of the pink stickies, she explains their importance to her co-workers who love this particular item of stationery. When it is time to reorder stationery, she makes sure there are plenty of pretty sticky pads and that each team member gets some.  Amanda would like a larger desk so she could spread out her work, and suggests her desk could do with a clean. She describes her work as "gravitating from the centre to the edge of my desk, it can then be tossed or filed". Amanda is very clear about the significance of celebration and relationships in her work life. She notes that she "spends more time at work than at home" and talks about her husband's support in managing their children. Because she is a team leader she is able to use the meeting rooms if she needs to make a personal phone call, although she says "my husband does most of the running around, he has a cell phone".

Camila is in her mid-30s and has worked at IG for seven

years. She is Canadian, describes herself as someone who loves people and enjoys helping her co-workers who she describes as "friends". She has a young daughter whose handprints decorate her workstation. She has worked in this department for five years and has occupied this desk location for two weeks. Camila explains she likes to take time to set up her desk, and talks about her office supplies. "I love my tape dispenser, it's green and brightens up my desk." Office paraphernalia is supplied by IG but Camila likes to buy her own so she can have something different at her desk. The personal items on her desk have taken years to accumulate, as even highlighters and office supplies are passed on from retiring employees. "It is sad to see them go" but the supplies serve as reminders. They obviously have a trade value and are redistributed as gifts. They seem to become a colourful part of the décor of her desk. Camila notes that most of the things at her desk are personal but she doesn't mind sharing them.  She describes her work as "very very routine," "especially for the processors who ask the same questions of different clients". Her job keeps her sitting at her desk "90 percent of the day". The personalia she chooses to describe are her daughter's handprints. She made these at home with her daughter "when she discovered her hands" at two and a half years old. She made a set for her husband too, so they could both take them to work to display. Camila has photographs of her child at various ages, from a baby to a toddler and sitting on Father Christmas's lap at the IG Christmas party. Her colleagues at work "like to see the children growing up" and appreciate current pictures. She says, "Pictures of my daughter help me get through the day. On a bad day they help me to cope."

There is a cheeky green frog that dances sitting on top of her

baby photos close to the base of the screen on the left-hand side. A tiny car holds decorative bulldog clips by the calendar on the right side of her screen, and on her hard drive below the screen is a collection of colourful post-it notes, a fish in the shape of a ball that opens its fins to expose its eyes (a McDonalds happy meal toy), and two koalas with Australian flags. She explains the koalas were brought back by her cousin from a trip to Australia. She tells me "the toys remind me of my daughter, I miss her during the day". She shares a nice story about the toys. Her little girl plays with the toys in the car and then slips them into her mother's handbag so Camila finds them when she gets to work. Camila says they are "great icebreakers for someone new" in the department, and create a place to start a conversation. She tells me about a co-worker who has a collection of hundreds of happy toys around her workstation. Each time she moves she packs them into a shoebox and carefully rearranges them when she settles into a new location.  Like her co-workers, Camila has a number of IG-related magnets that celebrate United Way campaign donations and anniversary cards that mark the years worked at IG. She wonders if displaying them is "obsessive". But she answers her own question with the assertion that "I feel proud, I worked hard for it". There is a photo-strip from a photo booth of a masked man and woman exchanging a kiss. Camila explains these images were taken at an IG formal masquerade ball from Christmas 2011 that she attended with her husband. The teams also exchange secret Santa gifts at Christmas and these things often find their way onto the desktop; her white picture frame is an example. She notes that about half of the personalia on her desk are planned and the others arrive spontaneously. The magnetic letter D at her desk was the last remnant of a set of letters from home and for some reason she brought it to work. Co-workers will "notice anything new on the desk".

Her desk is her favourite place in the office with its reminders of her daughter and the closeness of her other co-workers. She suggests her co-workers would be able to identify her from the things on her desk; "someone in my department would know it's my desk."  We talk about privacy at her desk. She says, "It isn't too bad, but I have to tune out noisy people. I turn up the music, we are allowed to listen to our own IPODs or CDs. They don't mind what we you do, if you do your work." Personal telephone conversations are a problem because employees are discouraged from having them at their desks. "I go out into the hallway ­ it's the only place for private conversations." This makes arranging dental or doctor appointments or talking with the bank difficult. Camila reflects "it would be nice to have a spot to go to make personal calls". If she has to have a personal conversation at the desk, she faces the wall or sits lower to the desk, but this isn't a comfortable or convenient solution.

Laura has worked at IG for nine and a half years in the same

department and has been sitting at this desk for two years. Her desk is next to the windows and is screened on two sides with panels; she takes an occasional break to enjoy the view. Her work is not routine and changes everyday. Laura's desk has very little personalia on it and she doesn't like to have her work space cluttered. She says a cluttered desk in the morning would mean she couldn't concentrate all day. There is a picture of her son, who has just turned 14, in his goalie gear. He plays AA hockey for St James and won a championship this year. He is living away from home with his grandparents because of his hockey commitments in the city. Laura lives in the country and obviously misses him. This photograph is displayed on the hard drive on the right side of her screen, and I am told later by a co-worker that sometimes this photo gets put away too.  Laura uses earphones to listen to music when she needs to concentrate but she says co-workers "can interrupt at any time". She takes her personal calls in the hallway when necessary but she doesn't make a lot of private calls. Teamwork for Laura may involve visiting another desk or more formal meetings but she says "getting up is good".  Laura has a system to identify a document when she first looks at it. She uses a different coloured marker for each day of the week. She keeps her markers in a Tim Hortons papercup that is on her desk next to a stapler and a yellow star made of soft material. This was given to her by her son and "I play with it to relieve stress".

 Laura has the IG social event calendar pinned up and explains, "IG organizes social events mainly over the RSP season to try to recognize the extra work and long hours worked." She shows me the mouse pad that was a gift from management; she chose the blue one. A magnet on her desk drawer from Cancer Care was given to her for participating in a wear-jeans-to-work day. When I ask if this display is for her benefit only, she says, "You betcha!" She says her desk doesn't invite co-workers' comments unless she changes something.  Laura likes to look outside during the working day for relief from her intense screen-based work. She complains the boss's desk is too close to hers and suggests it should be moved so she wouldn't feel so scrutinized. Laura tidies her desk before leaving each evening, making sure everything is put away. She doesn't dust or clean down her desk as some of her co-workers do.

Reyna was born in the `70s. She comes from the Philippines

and has worked for Investors Group for eight months, with six of those months spent in this department at this location.  When things get busy, she uses her headset to shut out external distractions and is able to concentrate by focusing on her monitor. Her desk is only screened on one side and is open to her neighbour on the other. This gives Reyna a very small area that she can personalize. She is a processor working with repetitive transactions. She has placed her computer screen to face the dividing panel so her back is to her nearest neighbour. There are very few personal items at her desk as she says she prefers to focus on her work. She is a private person who "likes to separate work and home". Later in our conversation she tells me she doesn't want personal things on her desk "that might generate conversation about my personal life". She mentions the problem of having to take personal calls in the hallway at lunchtime, as IG policy prevents the women in this department from taking calls at their desks during working hours.  Tucked into the corner of her desk is a red tinsel Christmas tree (it is now February), obviously a remnant from Christmas celebrations in the office "It was given to me by a co-worker," Reyna explained, and has "forgotten to put it away". On the left side of her screen is a drink flask that she fills twice a day along with the paper towel she uses to clean her desk every morning. The Satsuma plum stickers on the file drawers are a remnant of the previous occupant of the space.

 Reyna has the social event calender posted on her hard drive, and talks about these events as significant to relieving the monotony of the week. There is "an event for everybody" that occurs during the working day; some are games and workers take 15 minutes off to participate, and "sometimes they bring us food". Reyna explains the social events are how IG shows its appreciation for their hard work. I ask about the fresh green mouse pad on her desk and she tells me "green is very good for the eyes". It has its own narrative, having been brought from the Philippines by a co-worker at a previous employer, and given to Reyna. She tells me "it brightens every single moment of the day". She describes her desk as her favourite place at IG because it is "comfortable". She has the codes she needs for her work pinned up on the right-hand side of her screen to remind herself to check them. At night she removes the day's files from her desk and tidies up so she is "organized for the next day". Reyna likes to feel in control.

Felicity is in her mid-30s. She is a Canadian with ten years at

IG; six years at her current department and one year at her current workstation location. Her desk is spare and clean. Felicity has either cleaned her desk in anticipation of the interview or she is a very tidy person. There is a headset at her desk but Felicity uses it for phone conversations rather than to listen to music, and she is able to control the volume without disturbing other colleagues. She talks about adjusting her working day depending on what she needs to accomplish. If the project needs particular focus she will work on it in the morning and tune out other activities around her. Felicity doesn't see her work as routine, although it used to be. "Over the last year I don't know what I will be doing when I come in" to work, and there is "a good variety".  She sits facing out into the office "so I can see anyone approaching me" and likes to work with the screen lower so she can see over it. Her hard drive sits next to the screen and is covered with images of family members, kids and summer snapshots at the lake. She explains they are her nephew and niece and she likes to be able to see them as she works. They "lighten up a difficult day" and represent "something to look at when you are frustrated". The location on her hard drive makes the photos "easy to look at".  There is no company policy she is aware of about what she can display at her desk. However, she thinks she would have been told if anything was considered "inappropriate". I ask about the hooded figure (looks a bit like a Star Wars character) that sits on the top of her workstation panels and she shared the story of its origin with me. It is a mascot of the department and has travelled around the department, spending time on a number of desks.

Felicity

Felicity recalls that it came into the department with a co-worker's visiting child and stayed on even after the co-worker left.  The small silver cup that sits next to the hard drive is from a Christmas party with work colleagues on a winning bowling team, although "none of those people are in the department anymore, the last person to leave passed off the trophy". A red shoe ornament hanging to the right of her screen was a gift from the team leader Kelly-Jo. Two work anniversary cards for 2012 and 2013 from IG are prominently displayed. When I asked her why she displayed them she was unsure. "I don't even know why," but after further consideration she offered "they relate to our employee benefits, we earn an extra week of holidays" after a certain number of years in IG's employment. Felicity's desk also displays a number of stickers received for donations to causes supported by IG employees, such as the Christmas Cheer Board and the Rainbow Society. She suggested, "People like to feel they are contributing to something else."  Felicity sees the personalization of her desk as a balance between her work and home life, and while she puts the personalia there for her own benefit she seems to enjoy her co-workers asking about the pictures. She would like to have more pinable surfaces at her workstation. When asked about her favourite space in the  workplace, she identifies her desk, with her least favourite space being a desk she worked at in "the closet", a small room with four co-workers and much less personal space and desk space.

Leigh was born in the Philippines and is in her early 40s. IG

has employed her for nine years and she has worked in this department for four years. She has only been at this workstation location for a month. She is teamed up so she can consult with her neighbours on similar work. She works facing the aisle and looks across at other workstations in the centre of the floor space. Her work requires her to sit for long periods of time working on the computer and phone. It is routine work, she says, but the details of each file are different. She doesn't like to work facing the window so she has her phone and headset on her right-hand side and her monitor facing the aisle. She says she has no problem concentrating but uses the headset to "let others know she is working". Team meetings usually happen at the leader's desk. She likes to work with her manuals on her desk for easy reference, but strives to "keep paper under control". She has a few marker pens and a nail file in a container on the right side next to her screen, but personal items are limited to a thermos, hand cleaner and hand cream further away from the screen on her right. The objects she has chosen to display in her new workstation are fairly small in number, mostly photographs of her two daughters who are now seven and two years old. She has the two girls photographed at the same age contained in one frame located on the right side of her screen and notes how much they look alike. She has more current images of them framed on the left side of her screen. She explains that it "feels relaxing when I look at them, especially when work is stressful".

Leigh is obviously a proud mother and she talks about the

special significance of the MOM magnetic sign on her file cabinet. Her co-workers gave it to her when she returned to work after baby number two. It says "New Mom, babies make your heart grow bigger." She also has a ceramic angel, given to her by friends at work; it is her "guardian angel at work". She has taken a piece of a colleague's plant and is waiting for roots to sprout. It sits in a glass by the framed family photograph and provides "something green at my desk, a real plant, not something artificial".  Leigh tells me that everything has its place on her desk, and she cleans it regularly to ensure good hygiene. "This helps me to think, before I start another task I tidy my desk." Leigh talks about her desk as her favourite place at IG, and describes it as having "a serene feel, my daughters are there". They effectively surround her while she is working.

Rose comes from the Philippines originally. She is in her

mid-30s and doesn't have any children. She has worked for IG in this department for three years and has been sitting at this location for about a year, her first year as a full-time employee. She listens to music on her headphones or just focuses to get work done, and "because I am small I can hide behind my monitor".  She decribes her work as routine "with some special cases that require new skills". Her desk is located next to a large window but she chooses to "face the neighbourhood" of adjoining cubicles. She loves being located close to the windows although it gets cold sometimes. She is still in training and is able to ask advice from her team for complex problems. She meets with her team leader one-on-one, once a month, but the team has projects or fundraiser meetings once a week. There is a busy social program at IG. The last Friday of each month has events like paying a donation to wear jeans to work. She proudly shows me her first anniversary card from IG and explains she received two employee recognition awards in the form of vouchers to select a gift from the IG employee website. She chose a headset and a purse. She notes they "keep my spirits up" and "help to motivate me', but they are also a source of curiosity for her workmates who want to know how she earned them.  Rose doesn't have any photos on her pin board, and says she can't keep up with photos of her nephews. She is more likely to display personal cards, but she does have a rather extraordinary ornament on her desk. It is a small paperweight in the form of an underwater scene, with blue dolphins leaping over a water-filled globe with a swimming dolphin inside.

Rose

132

She brought it from home and it functions as a conversation starter with her co-workers who comment "this is so nice".  Rose values having personal space and wants it "to reflect what I am" because she spends so much time at work. She is very efficient and likes to keep folders aligned and paperwork to a minimum. She also likes to be able to see the desk surface clean and clear. She cleans her desk surface once a week and takes pride in how her work area looks.  She has a memento from the Philippines that was given to her by a co-worker who visited home. A Canada Day pencil was given to her by the social committee, and they also gave her a flag when she took her citizenship exam. These items are located in her pencil container at the left side of her computer along with the headset that was provided by the company for training. She uses it to listen to music on her computer.  There is a mirror tucked into the space below the screen. When I ask her about it she shows me her braces and explains that "after eating I check my teeth." She also has a water bottle at the desk, as she is not a coffee drinker. We agree that the focus on her desk is mainly work items, and things that motivate and inspire her. The desk is carefully laid out to provide the information she needs in an efficient and tidy way. She uses online manuals so she doesn't need to store them at her desk. She says "I have everything I need" and "I enjoy being here". At lunchtime she likes to have lunch with office mates and go to the mall for a walk, and so she consolidates her breaks to have one hour of free time.

   `Je  suis  l'espace  ou  je  suis'  ­  `I  am  the  space  where  I  am'.  
(Arnaud  quoted  in  Bachelard  1994:  137)  

Introduction        Camila  has  a  turquoise  fish  in  the  shape  of  a  ball  that  opens  its  fins  to  expose  its   eyes  (a  McDonald's  Happy  Meal  toy)  and  two  koalas  with  Australian  flags  positioned  just   under  the  logo  on  her  computer  screen.  Camila's  little  girl  plays  with  the  small  toys   while  travelling  in  the  car  to  daycare  and  then  slips  them  into  her  mother's  handbag  so   Camila  discovers  them  when  she  gets  to  work.    Camila  explains,  "The  toys  remind  me  of   my  daughter,  I  miss  her  during  the  day."      The  space  of  the  women's  desks  is  lived,  personal  space.  For  some  the  area   occupied  with  personalia  is  very  small,  closely  focused  around  the  computer  screen  at   the  nexus  of  the  two  work  surfaces.    This  space  is  occupied  by  their  most  valued   personal  items  -  photographs,  personal  messages,  hand  lotion,  a  small  mirror  for   checking  teeth  or  lips  or  noses,  and  often  a  collection  of  neon  markers  and  pens,  as  well   as  codes,  shortcuts  and  other  important  work-related  information.  The  area  is  in  their   peripheral  vision  while  they  are  working  and  they  find  these  chosen  objects  and  images   relaxing,  colourful,  comforting  reminders  of  life  outside  of  work,  and  the  reason  for  their   stressful  and  routine  office  lives.    The  personalia  connect  them  to  their  other  lives  as   mothers,  wives  and  friends.      Some  of  the  women  who  have  occupied  their  desks  longer  have  extended  their   collections  of  personalia  along  the  top  edge  of  the  cubical  panels  and  pin  board  to  the   end  of  the  area  that  defines  their  desk.    As  the  objects  radiate  outwards,  they  become   more  public  and  less  personal,  having  more  to  do  with  the  importance  of  co-worker

Introduction        Camila  has  a  turquoise  fish  in  the  shape  of  a  ball  that  opens  its  fins  to  expose  its   eyes  (a  McDonald's  Happy  Meal  toy)  and  two  koalas  with  Australian  flags  positioned  just   under  the  logo  on  her  computer  screen.

relationships,  worker  recognition  and  the  corporate  team,  and  the  mythology  of  the   happy  office  worker  through  mementos  of  social  events  and  fundraisers.        The  office  environment  in  the  Investors  Group  headquarters  is  a  space  of   representation  where  each  workstation  cubicle  imposes  the  order  of  the  hegemony  on   the  bodies  of  the  women  workers.    The  conceived  space  of  the  office  is  systematized   and  standardized,  with  each  workstation  looking  exactly  like  its  neighbour.    The   environment  speaks  of  anonymity  with  uniform  furniture  imprinted  with  corporate   values  and  team  identities.  Positions  next  to  the  windows  are  coveted,  like  window   seats  on  an  aircraft,  because  they  present  the  illusion  of  having  more  space.    The  space   outside  the  window  presents  the  opportunity  to  remove  oneself  for  a  few  minutes  to   daydream.  The  quality  of  natural  light  varies  through  the  day,  with  large  windows   providing  maximum  access  to  views  and  connection  to  the  outside  weather  conditions.     Venetian  blinds  attempt  to  filter  strong  sunlight  on  the  southern  orientation.            De  Certeau  celebrated  the  notion  that  the  everyday  person  retains  some  vestige   of  control  over  their  environment.  De  Certeau  patiently  develops  a  research   methodology,  derived  from  sociology,  anthropology  and  narrative  research,  to  uncover   these  slippages  and  subtle  practices.  In  "The  Practice  of  Everyday  Life  Volume  2",  De   Certeau  and  his  circle  of  young  graduates  study  the  city  and  its  inhabitants  to   understand  the  cultural  practices  of  the  everyday;  practices  such  as  cooking,  reading   and  walking  around  the  city.  They  move  beyond  the  usual  depiction  of  the  mindless   masses  to  closely  analyze  the  everyday  practices  of  personal  consumption  (1998:xx).  De   Certeau  is  most  interested  in  the  purposes  to  which  the  consumed  objects  are  put,   looking  for  small  practices  of  resistance.  In  the  street  it  might  be  the  path  taken  home   that  delights  in  small  diversions;  in  everyday  life  it  might  be  the  role  of  a  café  or  bar  in   the  satisfaction  of  an  individual's  need  for  community  or  an  escape  from  family   expectations.      This  chapter  of  the  dissertation  looks  at  the  close  environment  of  11  routine   office  workers  in  the  financial  services  industry  to  observe  and  study  embodied  space   and  the  tactics  the  women  clerical  workers  employ  to  claim  space  as  their  own.    As  my      136  

  
methods  were  informed  by  De  Certeau's  approaches,  I  began  by  writing  a  narrative  for   each  woman  based  on  my  interview  field  notes  (Chapter  5).  Interviews  were  typically  60   minutes  long  with  a  semi  structured  interview  format  (Appendix  1).  At  the  request  of  IG,   employees  were  interviewed  in  a  meeting  room  and  not  at  their  desks;  my  photographs   of  their  desk  space  served  as  empirical  evidence  that  brought  a  new  perspective  and   implied  value  to  their  personal  space.    The  photographs  have  been  edited  into  a  visual   composite  for  each  woman's  desk  (Chapter  5).  Using  the  narratives,  field  notes  and   photographs,  I  developed  an  analytical  model  for  the  analysis  in  this  chapter  that  springs   directly  from  the  values  and  priorities  identified  by  the  women  at  their  desks.    It  starts   from  the  organizational  culture  and  addresses  social  networks  and  habitus,  identities   and  values,  tidiness  and  control,  time  and  space,  and  private  space.  The  analysis  situates   the  photo-elicitation  research  within  the  framework  of  the  organizational  culture  of   Investors  Group  gleaned  from  company  literature,  interviews  with  senior  management,   and  the  former  CEO  and  Chairman  of  the  Board,  as  well  as  Robert  Jones'  book,  Building   Futures:  A  History  of  Investors  Group  (1993).  I  also  talked  to  middle  managers  and  the   concierge,  a  long-term  employee.       Investors  Group  was  established  in  1926  in  Canada  to  meet  the  financial  needs   of  the  salaried  working  class  with  a  weekly  personal  savings  scheme.  IG  introduced  the   first  Canadian  mutual  fund  in  1950.  By  the  1980s  the  firm  was  restructured  to  improve   internal  and  external  communications.  The  company  has  grown  exponentially  since  its   establishment  by  appealing  to  the  growing  middle  class  as  an  unpretentious,  egalitarian   organization  with  a  sense  of  civic  responsibility.    IG  has  an  established  reputation  as  a   good  employer;  offering  employees  low  interest  mortgages  and  stock  purchase   incentives  as  well  as  instituting  exemplary  employee  recognition  programs.  The   company  also  has  a  strong  record  of  civic  responsibility  and  community  support  and   development.  An  example  would  be  the  recent  construction  of  the  Investors  Group  Field   at  the  University  of  Manitoba  as  the  home  of  the  Winnipeg  Blue  Bombers  football  team.   IG  partnered  with  the  province  to  fund  the  project.  The  family  culture  of  IG,  with  its   strong  social  committee,  may  be  viewed  positively  in  terms  of  it  being  caring  and      137  

  
supportive,  or  it  may  be  seen  negatively  in  terms  of  being  controlling  and  motivated  by   corporate  needs.      Investors  Group  is  a  hierarchical  organization  where  the  power  resides  with  the   managerial  elites,  the  majority  of  whom  are  men.  The  relationship  between  the   organizational  culture  and  women's  values  is  one  of  imbalance  due  to  the  normative   structure  of  hegemonic  power.  This  relationship  generates  a  differential  space,  a  space   of  tension  and  potential.    It  is  here  that  we  see  the  women's  operations  and  tactics  as  a   technique  to  take  ownership  of  their  desk  spaces.    The  co-dependency  of  the  women's   values  and  office  team  culture  are  clearly  seen  in  the  symbolic  value  of  IG  awards  and   team  leaders'  gifts  of  recognition.    The  women  use  practices  of  tidiness  and  cleaning   routines  to  establish  their  professionalism  and  gain  control  over  the  steady  stream  of   work  that  crosses  their  desks.    These  operations  may  also  be  seen  as  tactics  of   resistance  in  response  to  specific  environmental  conditions  over  which  they  have  little   control.    "The  place  of  a  tactic  belongs  to  the  other.    A  tactic  insinuates  itself  into  the   other's  place,  fragmentarily,  without  taking  over  its  entirety,  without  being  able  to  keep   it  at  a  distance"  (De  Certeau  1984:  xix).      The  women  highly  value  their  social  networks  and  create  an  identity  at  their   desks  that  reflects  their  work  relationships,  past  and  present.  Personalia  at  their  desk   were  most  often  described  as  gifts  from  co-workers  and  friends;  they  take  the  form  of   birthday  and  thank-you  cards  and  poems,  coffee  mugs  and  office  supplies,  tchotchkes   and  travel  mementos.  These  objects  were  described  in  terms  of  the  event  and  person   they  celebrate.  Sharon  received  a  rose  from  her  co-workers  for  her  60th  birthday;  it  was   still  in  a  special  place  at  her  desk  a  few  years  later.    Pictures  of  family  are  sometimes   shared  for  personal  reasons,  but  the  photographs  generally  provide  motivation  and   stress  relief  to  the  women.  The  personalia  become  a  talking  point  for  others,  as  it  invites   connectedness  and  spontaneous  conversations.    It  has  an  important  role  in  the   representation  of  these  individuals  as  team  players.    Desks  become  home  places,  and   heterotopias  or  ideal  worlds  where  the  women  can  exercise  a  sense  of  control  and  

  

138  

  
indulge  in  daydreams  that  provide  relief  from  the  stress  of  the  continuous  flow  of  work   at  their  desks.      The  research  found  that  all  of  the  women  used  their  desk  space  to  represent   individual  and  multiple  identities.    Those  who  chose  not  to  share  personal  information   at  their  desks  were  quite  open  about  not  conforming  to  the  expected  norms  of  the   office,  and  articulated  a  desire  to  keep  their  personal  lives  separate  from  their  work   lives.  A  few  women  commented  on  the  "empty  desks"  of  co-workers  as  not  being   welcoming,  thus  reinforcing  the  habitus  of  personal  display  as  an  invitation  to  co- workers  to  know  each  other  better.  Bourdieu  defines  "habitus"  as  socializing  norms  that   guide  behaviour.  Habitus  is  socially  constructed  and  constantly  relegitimized  by  an   interplay  between  structure  and  agency  (Bourdieu  1984).      The  Locus  of  Personal  Space      Investors  Group  has  no  formal  policy  that  prescribes  the  nature  of  personalia   that  can  be  displayed  at  the  desk.    None  of  the  women  seemed  constrained  by  overt   organizational  censorship  and  all  viewed  their  desk  space  as  their  own  space,  often   describing  it  as  their  favourite  place  at  work.        Levels  of  privacy  for  the  personalia  at  their  desks  became  clearer  as  the  research   proceeded.    The  internal  corner  of  the  desk  where  the  screen  was  most  often  located   became  the  most  private  space.  Tchotchkes  and  photos  located  in  this  area  were  the   most  personal,  and  often  positioned  so  they  couldn't  be  easily  seen  by  co-workers.  The   narrative  associated  with  these  objects  are  often  more  emotional  and  personal.    Perl   reflected  on  a  half-hidden  snapshot  of  a  group  of  people  that  was  taken  in  Vietnam.  She   explained  that  before  coming  to  Canada,  she  had  been  co-opted  to  set  up  a  new   operating  system  in  Vietnam  for  a  former  employer.  She  had  not  wanted  to  go  but   insisted  on  taking  a  female  work  friend  with  her.  The  photo  records  a  happy  time,  but  it   is  not  one  she  shares  with  her  current  co-workers.    Further  away  from  her  screen  is  an   image  of  her  taken  with  Father  Christmas.  "I  was  pushed  (by  co-workers)  to  have  my   picture  taken  with  Santa,  it  reminds  me  of  a  Canadian  idea  of  Christmas."    The  more      139  

  
public  display  of  this  image  demonstrates  Perl's  commitment  to  her  co-workers  and   their  implicit  expectations,  and  her  concession  to  the  operations  of  social  networks  and   the  office  habitus.          As  objects  are  distanced  from  the  screen  and  become  more  readily  visible  to   others,  they  also  became  more  related  to  organizational,  team  and  social  values.   Tchotchkes  often  had  narratives  that  involved  co-workers  who  were  no  longer  in  the   same  department,  or  there  were  family  items  for  social  networking  purposes,   positioned  to  become  the  subjects  of  "icebreaking"  conversations  with  new  co-workers.     They  became  symbols  that  identify  the  women  as  moms  or  aunties,  cat-lovers  and   friends.  These  items  encouraged  others  to  linger  and  engage  in  conversation.      For  some  women  the  need  to  keep  their  personal  lives  distant  from  their  work   lives  is  clearly  reflected  in  the  personalia  or  lack  of  it  at  their  desks.  Laura's  desk  has  very   little  personalia  and  she  doesn't  like  to  have  her  workspace  cluttered.    She  says,  "A   cluttered  desk  in  the  morning  would  mean  I  couldn't  concentrate  all  day."          Reyna  is  also  a  private  person  who  says  she  "likes  to  separate  work  and  home".   Later  in  our  conversation  she  tells  me  she  doesn't  want  personal  things  on  her  desk   "that  might  generate  conversation  about  my  personal  life".  These  examples   demonstrate  the  complexity  of  the  relationships  individuals  have  with  the  habitus  of  the   office  and  their  expectations  of  others.    Both  Reyna  and  Laura  understand  the   significance  of  being  team  players.  They  participate  in  IG  events,  display  the  IG  event   calendar  and  speak  about  welcoming  others  to  their  desks,  but  for  them  the   private/public  divide  is  much  more  difficult.      Identities  and  Values                De  Certeau  describes  tactics  in  relation  to  the  everyday  of  living,  as  the  creative   intelligence  we  employ  to  ensure  our  environment  works  for  our  needs.  Tactics  allow   ordinary  people  the  capacity  to  subvert  the  all-pervasive  pressures  of  consumerism,   economics,  and  politics  to  assert  their  individuality  and  autonomy.     Amanda  is  a  team  leader.  Her  desk  is  at  the  end  of  a  line  of  cubicles  against  a  window.        140  

  
Under  her  screen  is  a  red  smurf,  a  little  plastic  devil.    She  describes  it  as  representing  her   true  personality  as  a  "troublemaker".  She  has  reappropriated  this  object  to  create  new   meaning  that  is  very  personal  to  her,  and  that  becomes  obvious  by  its  placement  at  her   desk.    The  red  devil  acknowledges  aspects  of  Amanda's  identity  that  don't  fit  seamlessly   with  her  image  as  team  leader.  She  subverts  the  smurf  character  to  remind  her  of  this   aspect  of  herself,  and  as  such  knits  together  a  more  complex  and  authentic   representation  of  her  own  identity,  one  that  speaks  of  autonomy.  De  Certeau  looks  at   such  practices  of  consumption  to  uncover  the  ways  in  which  the  consumer  appropriates   and  reappropriates  the  objects  of  their  consumption  to  create  new  meaning  (1984:  xiii).      Through  the  research  I  found  many  examples  of  poaching  (the  reappropriation  of   objects  to  serve  another  purpose).  The  women  use  their  hard  drives  as  pin  boards  when   pin-up  space  is  insufficient,  and  organize  personal  items  across  the  front  of  an   unscreened  desk  to  create  a  territorial  boundary  between  co-workers.  The   reappropriation  of  office  supplies  that  become  gifts  from  departing  co-workers  speaks   of  poaching,  as  does  using  the  computer  screen  to  hide  behind  when  making  illicit   personal  calls  from  the  desk.    Routines  for  cleaning  the  desk  give  the  women  the   opportunity  to  pause  before  starting  a  new  project.    These  IG  offices  offer  very  little   freedom  to  the  women  who  occupy  them.  They  are  highly  supervised  and  constrained   by  the  quantity  of  work  they  need  to  address  in  a  day.        The  women  complained  about  very  few  aspects  of  their  work  lives;  however,   they  consistently  mentioned  their  concerns  with  the  cleanliness  and  hygiene  of  the   washrooms  on  their  floor.  Most  of  the  women  had  rituals  around  the  cleaning  of  their   desk  surface  as  a  daily  or  weekly  exercise.  I  interpreted  this  tactic  of  cleaning  as  a  partial   response  to  the  condition  of  the  washrooms,  which  they  cannot  control.  But  the   cleaning  ritual  also  brought  closure  to  the  endless  stream  of  routine  work  to  be  done.     This  ritual  marked  the  end  of  the  day  or  week,  and  exerts  a  habitus  where  moral  virtues   are  expressed  through  bodily  actions,  emotional  states,  thoughts  and  social   performance  (Mahmood  2001).    The  virtues  of  cleanliness  and  order  are  particularly   apparent  at  the  desks  of  the  Southeast  Asian  women.        141  

  
   Filipino  women  are  the  most  visible  group  of  foreign  workers  in  Canada  today   (Bonifacio  2013).  Bonifacio  argues  that  due  to  a  number  of  historical  factors  they  have   become  "ideal"  migrants.  They  are  well  educated  and  assimilate  quickly  into  Canadian   society.  "They  are  also  the  most  highly  socially  integrated  group  of  women  from  Asia   due  to  intermarriage  and  a  western  colonial  legacy"  (2013:  2).  Despite  their  capacity  for   integration,  identity  for  immigrant  women  is  complex.  "Transnational  border  crossings   between  `home'  (country  of  origin)  and  `other  home'  (host  community)  for  permanent   residents  and  citizens  make  the  notions  of  identity,  citizenship,  and  community  appear   fluid  and  unbounded  by  a  specified  territory.  Filipinos  in  diaspora,  especially  women,   create  and  recreate  semblances  of  what  it  is  to  be  `at  home'"  (2013:  19).      Reyna,  Perl,  Molly,  Leigh  and  Rose  are  all  from  Southeast  Asia.  Perl  comes  from   Indonesia  and  the  other  women  are  from  the  Philippines.    They  all  have  some  small  item   at  their  desks  that  evokes  home.  I  ask  Reyna  about  the  fresh  green  mouse  pad  on  her   desk  and  she  tells  me  a  co-worker  brought  it  from  the  Philippines  for  her.    She  tells  me   "it  brightens  every  single  moment  of  the  day"  and  its  connection  to  her  home  makes  it  a   special  part  of  her  otherwise  impersonal  and  very  tidy  desk.  As  a  new  employee  she  has   not  accumulated  much  at  her  desk  apart  from  a  small  red  tinsel  Christmas  tree  tucked   behind  her  hard  drive.  This  is  obviously  a  remnant  from  Christmas  celebrations  in  the   office.  "It  was  given  to  me  by  a  co-worker"  and  she  has  "forgotten  to  put  it  away".    On   the  left  side  of  her  screen  are  a  drink  flask  that  she  fills  twice  a  day  and  the  paper  towel   she  uses  to  clean  her  desk  every  morning.  The  tree  seems  accidental  in  its  placement  at   her  desk  but  it  establishes  Reyna's  connectedness  to  her  adopted  North  American   culture,  where  excessive  consumerism  at  Christmas  can  be  shocking  to  those  raised  in   the  developing  nations  of  Southeast  Asia.      This  theme  is  also  seen  at  Perl's  desk  where  she  has  a  Christmas  gnome   ornament  and  a  red  and  green  beaded  tray  that  says  HO  HO,  made  by  a  co-worker.  She   explains  to  me  that  the  Canadian  idea  of  Christmas  seems  very  foreign  to  her  and  she   has  these  items  at  her  desk  to  remind  her  "Christmas  is  a  good  thing  (in  Canada)".

Molly  has  a  small  carved  shell  at  her  desk,  a  traveller's  memento  from  a  friend  in   the  Philippines.  But  she  also  prizes  a  small  ornament  of  a  stork  and  baby  that  is  carefully   displayed  on  a  square  of  mirror  on  the  top  edge  of  her  desk.    She  explained  this  is  a   traditional  Filipino  christening  or  baptism  gift.      Leigh  also  has  a  christening  gift  that  sits   at  the  base  of  her  screen.    It  is  a  fat  pink  cherub  that  she  describes  as  her  "guardian   angel  at  work".  These  praying  angels  are  often  given  as  favours  to  family  celebrating  a   Catholic  christening.    Not  too  overtly  religious,  these  small  favours  are  reminders  of   family  celebrations  and  religious  and  cultural  traditions  for  the  women,  and  perhaps   provide  a  place  where  the  women  recognize  and  share  similar  cultural  traditions.        Symbols  of  the  women's  adoption  of  Canadian  culture  are  evidenced  by  the   display  of  small  gifts  of  recognition  from  IG's  social  committee.  They  are  proudly   displayed  on  Perl  and  Rose's  desks  and  are  part  of  the  objects  they  choose  to  talk  about.   Perl  explains  the  flag  mug  celebrates  her  taking  Canadian  citizenship  in  2004.  She  is   "very  proud  to  be  a  Canadian  citizen"  and  reminds  me  that  having  citizenship  allows  her   to  return  home  for  a  holiday  every  four  years.    She  points  out  "there  are  no  old  age   pensions  in  the  Third  World".      These  ornaments  not  only  create  identities  for  the  women  who  display  them,   they  also  allow  peers  to  recognize  that  a  different  culture  is  present  and  alive.    They   demonstrate  the  complexity  of  making  a  home  away  from  home  that  honours  and  is   respectful  of  conflicting  and  diverse  loyalties.      Social  Networks      Daniel  Miller  (2008,  2009)  asserts  that  human  relations  are  fundamental  to   human  life  in  contemporary  society  and  material  possessions  provide  the  underpinning   to  them,  an  assertion  that  was  borne  out  by  this  research.    Drawing  initially  from   Bourdieu,  Miller  suggests  objects  socialize  people  to  "particular  cultures".  The  particular   cultures  at  IG  are  backgrounded  by  the  organizational  culture,  but  in  closer  proximity  is   the  team  culture  of  the  departments.  Team  leaders  reward  team  members  with  tokens   of  appreciation  for  their  hard  work.    My  research  was  undertaken  in  January  2013,      143  

  
which  is  RSP  season,  when  a  lot  of  overtime  hours  are  necessary  to  manage  the   workload.    Felicity  showed  me  a  red  shoe  ornament,  Laura  had  a  coloured  mouse  pad,   and  Molly  displayed  a  cheery  fabric  sunflower,  all  gifts  from  team  leaders.  A  number  of   the  women  have  notes  of  appreciation  from  team  leaders,  and  when  questioned  about   them  explained  they  displayed  them  to  show  their  appreciation  for  the  recognition.    If   Miller's  (2008)  assertion  that  objects  influence  the  behaviours  and  beliefs  of  people  is   true,  these  gifts  of  thanks  are  significant  supports  that  encourage  the  women  to   continue  those  very  behaviours  that  have  been  rewarded.    The  relationships  within  the   team  culture  are  complex  and  demonstrate  the  underlying  understanding  of  the   connectedness  to  others,  to  knowledge  and  sensitivity  to  the  connectedness  of   categories  that  are  part  of  women's  ways  of  knowing.  The  women's  self-identity  is   formed  through  connection  to  and  identification  with  everyday  experiences;  as  a   consequence  women  tend  to  look  for  connections  rather  than  dichotomies.    The  IG   social  committee  recognizes  and  celebrates  the  occasions  when  employees  obtain   citizenship  status  with  small  gifts  of  a  Canadian  flag,  a  mug  with  a  Canadian  flag  and  a   pencil.  These  object  act  to  solidify  the  women's  sense  of  belonging.      There  are  other  sub-cultures  at  work,  such  as  the  lunchtime  walkers.    A  loosely   defined  group  of  women  walk  together  at  lunchtime.    It  is  not  clear  if  this  group   participates  less  in  organized  social  events  but  they  use  their  lunch  hour  to  exercise,   walking  the  raised  walkway  that  connects  IG  with  Portage  Place  and  other  downtown   buildings  and  loops  around  the  city  core.        As  previously  discussed,  the  personalia  at  the  women's  desks  were  often  quite   consciously  placed  to  provoke  and  invite  conversations.  New  employee  Rose  discusses   her  reasons  for  bringing  a  dolphin  ornament  to  work  as  a  substitute  for  photos  of   children,  because  she  doesn't  have  any  children.  It  is  a  paperweight  in  the  form  of  an   underwater  scene;  blue  dolphins  leaping  over  a  water-filled  globe  with  a  swimming   dolphin  inside.  It  functions  as  a  conversation  starter  with  her  new  co-workers  who   comment,  "This  is  so  nice".      

  

144  

  
   Aids  to  conversation  are  important  to  most  of  the  women.  They  are  expected  to   welcome  others  at  their  desks  to  facilitate  the  collaboration  that  is  required  for  their   work,  but  they  also  wish  to  appear  approachable  and  friendly.  Co-workers  notice  when   there  is  any  change  in  the  personalia  at  the  desk  and  always  want  to  see  recent   photographs  of  children,  grandchildren,  nephews  and  nieces.      These  photographs  give   glimpses  into  the  women's  lives  away  from  work  and  allow  friendships  to  develop.   However,  this  is  not  always  a  welcome  outcome.    Laura  has  a  picture  of  her  son,  who   has  just  turned  14,  in  his  goalie  gear.    He  plays  AA  hockey  at  St.  James  and  won  a   championship  this  year.    He  is  living  away  from  home  with  his  grandparents  because  of   his  hockey  commitments  in  the  city.  Laura  lives  outside  the  city  and  obviously  misses   him.  This  photograph  is  displayed  on  the  hard  drive  on  the  right  side  of  her  screen,  and   another  employee  tells  me  later  that  sometimes  this  photo  gets  put  away.    Laura  has  no   desire  to  share  this  relationship  with  others.      A  complex  network  of  social  relationships  is  evident  on  most  of  the  desks  of  the   women.  Familial  groups,  friends  and  co-workers  are  most  frequently  the  givers  of  the   personal  objects  that  reside  on  the  desks.  The  culture  of  the  organization  is  also  strongly   represented  through  certificates  of  work  anniversaries,  mementos  of  work  events  and   the  IG  social  event  calendar  that  most  women  have  at  their  desks.      Sharon  describes  the  collaboration  required  to  perform  her  job  and  understands   this  informs  the  layout  of  the  office  cubicles  that  give  so  little  private  space  to  each   woman.  The  personalia  at  her  desk  are  charged  with  social  relations,  implicating  her  co- workers  as  friends  and  supporters.    The  number  of  objects  at  her  desk  attests  to  time   accumulated  in  this  department  at  this  desk.  Sharon  speaks  about  the  importance  of   demonstrating  her  affiliation  with  "Team  Awesome"  and  proudly  displays  rewards  she   has  collected  alongside  photographs  of  her  cat.  This  is  the  busy  period  in  the   department  and  Sharon  has  worked  overtime  consistently  for  the  last  three  months.  She   uses  the  gifts  and  photos  at  her  desk  as  reminders  of  the  world  outside  her  work  to   relieve  stress.    

  

145  

  
   Molly  describes  her  personalia  as  "treasure",  including  a  traveller's  memento   from  the  Philippines  and  a  carefully  placed  christening  tchotchke  that  have  specific   cultural  meaning  for  her.      Even  in  the  office  environment  that  has  its  own  explicit  culture,  Laura  seeks  her   own  ways  to  express  her  identity.  She  chooses  to  keep  her  desk  empty  of  personalia,   resisting  the  expectation  of  normative  ways  of  operating  by  withholding  her  personal   stories  and  private  life,  resisting  peer  pressure  to  share.  She  does,  however,  value  the  IG   social  events  and  takes  advantage  of  opportunities  to  get  up  from  her  desk.  Perl  also   reflects  on  the  pressure  to  have  photos  at  her  desk.    Laura  and  Perl  demonstrate  there   are  flexible  ways  of  operating  that  women  can  adopt  without  excluding  themselves  from   the  social  networks  of  activity  in  the  organization.    Perl  enjoys  opportunities  to  share   food  with  her  co-workers,  building  relationships  through  personal  generosity.  Perl  was   the  only  participant  who  had  food  at  her  desk.  She  spoke  about  "coming  from  a  family   where  food  was  not  always  available"  and  the  importance  of  sharing.  Her  boss  from   Toronto  "brought  fruit  to  my  desk  knowing  I  will  share  it  with  the  others".  This   recognition  was  a  source  of  pride  for  her.      The  objects  at  many  of  the  women's  desks  show  their  participation  in  corporate   fundraising  activities  that  demonstrate  their  "ethic  of  care".  From  the  personalia  at  the   desks,  it  is  evident  that  individual  subjects  choose  to  support  the  organizational  culture   through  participation  in  IG  events.  Camila  suggests,  "People  like  to  feel  they  are   contributing  to  something  else".      Material  Culture      The  objects  at  the  desks  generally  have  little  monetary  value,  but  they  bring   colour  and  detail  to  the  desks  and  create  home  places  for  the  women.    They  are  playful   and  often  whimsical.  Some  women  have  accumulated  many  objects  and  like  the   busyness  they  create,  and  they  take  great  care  in  arranging  the  objects  on  their  desks.   Others  have  very  little  on  their  desks  and  are  judged  by  some  co-workers  for  not   providing  a  work  identity  for  others'  consumption  and  comment.    There  are  tactics  for      146  

  
dealing  with  the  culture  of  personal  display.  Rose's  dolphin  ornament  is  a  distraction   that  replaces  photographs  of  loved  ones,  allowing  her  to  engage  with  her  co-workers   who  like  to  comment.  The  relevance  of  material  culture  research  to  the  project  of   studying  the  everyday  is  significant,  as  evidenced  in  the  work  of  Daniel  Miller   (2008,2009).    His  work  seeks  to  understand  our  relationship  to  objects  in  contemporary   society  and  the  complex  role  that  consumption  plays  in  human  emotions  such  as   separation  and  loss,  and  expressions  of  love.  At  Leigh's  desk  we  see  her  devotion  to  her   children  with  images  of  them  taken  when  they  were  both  two  years  old.    She  proudly   displays  the  New  Mom  magnetic  sign  and  the  ceramic  cherub,  both  gifts  from  co- workers.    They  are  reminders  of  her  other  important  role  as  mother.        Time  and  Space      Relationships  between  co-workers  span  a  temporal  spectrum  with  new   friendships  formed  as  people  move  into  the  department.  Team  and  co-worker   relationships  are  established  while  they  work  together,  and  as  they  depart,  retire  and   move  on,  past  co-workers  are  remembered  by  gifted  tokens  and  office  supplies.  The   objects  hold  oneiric  value  for  the  women  and  honor  co-workers'  contributions  and  past   friendships.  A  habitus  has  developed  among  the  women  that  relates  to  the   redistribution  and  gifting  of  office  supplies,  with  highlighter  pens  and  sticky  notes  being   of  particular  value.  The  tradition  was  explained  to  me  as  those  who  retire  or  leave   distribute  their  office  supplies  amongst  their  co-workers.  Talking  about  the  personal   items  on  her  desk,  Camila  says  they  have  taken  years  to  accumulate;  "Even  highlighters   and  office  supplies  are  passed  on  from  retiring  employees.    It  is  sad  to  see  them  go  but   the  supplies  serve  as  reminders."  These  utilitarian  items  become  a  colourful  focal  point   in  the  beige  environment  of  the  desk.  Harmless  collections  of  office  necessities  mark   time  passed,  with  the  length  of  time  worked  celebrated  by  accumulation.      The  women  often  reflect  on  the  personalia  at  their  desks  as  narratives  of   departed  co-workers.    Among  the  stories  that  offer  a  temporal  narrative  is  the  story  of   the  Jawa.  I  ask  about  the  hooded  figure  that  sits  on  top  of  Felicity's  workstation  panels      147  

  
and  she  shares  the  story  of  its  origin  with  me.    It  has  become  a  mascot  of  the   department,  travelling  around  the  department  and  spending  time  on  a  number  of  desks.   She  recalls  that  it  came  into  the  department  when  a  co-worker's  child  was  visiting  and  it   remained  even  after  the  co-worker  left.    Felicity  also  remarks  on  the  small  silver  cup  that   sits  next  to  the  hard  drive.  It  is  from  a  Christmas  party  with  work  colleagues  who  were   the  winning  bowling  team.  "None  of  those  people  are  in  the  department  anymore,  the   last  person  to  leave  passed  off  the  trophy."  These  objects  symbolize  friendships  and   memories  that  have  meaning  to  Felicity.  She  has  become  the  keeper  of  these  everyday   stories  that  value  personal  experience,  and  demonstrates  an  ethic  of  care  in  line  with   women's  ways  of  knowing.            The  women's  relationships  to  their  close  work  environment  speak  of  spatial   tactics;  with  the  use  of  the  very  few  tools  they  have  at  hand,  they  manipulate  their   environments  to  better  serve  their  complex  individual  needs.  They  craft  the  displays  at   their  desks  to  comply  with  the  implicit  requirement  for  collaboration  and  co-operation   while  keeping  their  most  private  stories  hidden  in  proximity  to  their  computer  screens.     They  create  work-arounds  to  accommodate  personal  needs.  Camila  hides  behind  her   computer  screen  to  take  an  occasional  private  call  and  Felicity  keeps  her  screen  low  so   she  can  see  people  approaching  her  desk.    A  number  of  the  women  work  with  their   backs  to  their  nearest  neighbours,  while  others  welcome  and  enjoy  the  movement  of   others  around  their  desks  as  a  distraction  from  the  routine  work  of  the  day.  Low  height   panel-based  furniture  provides  no  opportunity  for  privacy,  acoustic  or  visual,  and  most   of  the  women  have  learned  to  shut  out  outside  distractions,  and  with  the  use  of   headphones  can  disregard  activity  around  them.    Sharon  spoke  of  adjusting  her   schedule  to  work  on  projects  requiring  concentration  either  early  in  the  morning  or  late   in  the  day  when  the  office  was  quieter.    The  IG  policy  of  no  personal  calls  contains  the   opportunity  to  connect  with  life  outside  of  their  space.    For  a  minimum  of  seven  hours  a   day,  the  workers  are  focused  and  refocused  on  the  priorities  and  needs  of  the   organization.

   The  quality  of  natural  light  varies  through  the  day  with  large  windows  providing   the  potential  for  maximum  access  to  views  and  connection  to  the  outside  weather   conditions.  Reyna  and  Rose  have  chosen  to  orient  themselves  to  their  co-workers  in   very  different  ways.  Reyna  maximizes  her  privacy  by  sitting  facing  away  from  her  co- workers,  emphasizing  her  need  to  be  private.    Rose  sits  facing  the  neighbourhood  of  co- workers,  emphasizing  her  dependency  as  a  newer  employee  and  developing  social   networks  of  support.   The  women  interviewed  all  complained  about  their  office  chairs,  saying  they  are  not   comfortable  for  extended  sitting.  The  problem  of  doing  such  focused  work  in  a  seated   position  all  day  has  consequences  for  their  health.  An  example  is  Gloria,  an  older   worker,  who  suffers  from  arthritis.    She  talked  about  the  need  to  get  exercise  in  her   lunch  hour  and  shift  her  focus  from  the  screen  to  a  middle  distance  to  provide  relief  for   her  eyes.     Embodied  spaces  are  the  locations  where  "human  experience  and  consciousness   takes  on  material  and  spatial  form"  according  to  Setha  Low.  Low  looks  at  the   contemporary  origins  of  the  body  as  an  intrinsic  component  of  spatial  analysis  (2003:9).   Starting  with  the  work  of  Michel  Foucault  (1975,  1986)  regarding  the  relationship  of   space,  bodies  and  power,  and  considering  Pierre  Bourdieu's  (1977)  notion  of  the   intersection  of  culture,  space  and  bodies  as  habitus,  Low  also  notes  the  work  of  Edward   Hall  (1968)  concerning  proxemics  ­  the  study  of  human  behaviour  in  response  to  space   and  culture.  Low  argues  for  an  integrated  embodied  spatial  theory  that  "addresses  the   metaphorical  and  material  aspects  of  the  body  in  space  as  well  as  the  body/space  to   communicate,  transform,  and  contest  existing  social  structures"  as  a  solution  to  the   problem  of  research  that  crosses  micro/macro  boundaries  from  the  individual  body  to   the  social  and  political  forces.          Tidiness  and  Control          Attention  to  the  mundane  activities  of  the  everyday  can  be  recognized  at  the   women's  desks  where  cleanliness  and  efficiency  are  important,  with  most  women      149  

  
cleaning  the  surface  of  their  desks  regularly  or  maintaining  a  strong  emphasis  on   keeping  paper  under  control.  Molly  has  almost  erased  time  from  her  desk  with  her   careful  cleaning  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  each  day,  allowing  her  to  start  fresh  each   morning.  Others  talk  about  cleaning  their  desks  before  starting  a  new  task,  or  having  a   routine  of  cleaning  the  desk  at  the  beginning  of  the  week.        Hygiene  and  efficiency  were  quite  significant  and  often  synonymous  for  the   Southeast  Asian  women.  Leigh  says,  "This  helps  me  think,  before  I  start  another  task  I   tidy  my  desk."  Molly  suggests  that  she  likes  to  clean  her  desk  but  "I  get  teased  about  it   by  others".    She  has  a  photocopied  sheet  under  her  keyboard  explaining  the  5S's,  a   Japanese  organizational  method.    The  5S's  advocate  tidiness,  orderliness,  cleanliness,   standardization  and  discipline  (according  to  Molly's  sheet).    These  values  were   introduced  to  industry  as  part  of  restructuring  in  the  1990s.    Molly  brought  this  with  her   from  the  Philippines  and  remembers,  "I  was  really  inspired  by  that,  I  read  it  once  in  a   while  and  it  reminds  me  to  take  control."    Perl  doesn't  mention  her  desk  cleaning   routine  but  notes  the  paper  towel  at  her  desk  is  for  cleaning  her  desk  and  sharing  food.   The  value  of  professionalism  is  represented  by  tidiness  at  the  desks  for  most  of  the   women,  and  paper  is  managed  with  a  variety  of  individual  practices.  Laura  uses  markers   for  different  days  of  the  week  so  she  can  easily  track  how  long  a  document  has  been  in   her  hands,  while  Rose  talks  about  aligning  the  folders  to  help  her  efficiency.    I  observed   objects  and  operations  working  to  influence  the  behaviours  and  beliefs  of  the  women.     Amanda's  work  starts  in  the  centre  of  her  desk  and  works  its  way  to  the  edges  of  the   desk  when  completed;  then  it  is  filed  or  thrown  out.    Some  women's  desks  have   procedural  files  in  hard  copy,  while  others  choose  to  refer  to  manuals  online  and  keep   the  desk  surfaces  clear.                       150  

  
Oneiric  Spaces:    dreams  and  angels      Topo-analysis  is  a  poetic  exploration  of  intimate  space  that  seeks  to  uncover   "how  we  inhabit  our  vital  space,  in  accord  with  all  the  dialectics  of  life,  how  we  take   root,  day  after  day,  in  a  `corner  of  the  world'"  (Bachelard  1994:  4).    The  concept  of  topo- analysis37  considers  the  emotional,  poetic  and  non-rational  ways  of  operating  that  are   evident  in  the  spaces  of  the  women  workers  at  Investors  Group.  The  workstation   configurations  used  by  the  clerical  workers  recreate  corners.  The  space  of  the  women's   desks  is  personal  space.  The  objects  and  images  at  their  desks  have  no  significant   material  value  and  therefore  have  been  kept  due  to  an  emotional  connection  or   important  memory.  They  may  be  transient  objects  chosen  for  their  colour  or  quirky   form.  The  women  with  children  talk  about  the  images  of  their  families  as  reminders  of   the  reason  for  their  often-stressful  routine  office  lives.       

  

Leigh  is  a  younger  and  newer  employee  who  has  opened  herself  up  to  making  

new  friendships  and  working  collaboratively.  She  signals  this  with  her  location  at  the   edge  of  a  corridor  and  her  position  at  the  desk.  Leigh's  workspace  radiates  calm  and   order;  she  talks  about  her  desk  as  her  favourite  space  at  IG.  Leigh  is  from  the  Philippines   and  is  watched  over  by  "a  guardian  angel",  a  chubby  ceramic  cherub  given  to  her  by  her   friends  at  work.  This  takes  a  special  place  at  the  base  of  her  computer  screen  but  the   space  around  her  screen  is  also  occupied  with  photographs  of  her  two  daughters.  The   desks  themselves  form  miniature  worlds  where  time  and  space  collide  in  unexpected   ways.  Captured  in  a  picture  frame  are  images  of  Leigh's  two  girls  taken  at  the  same  age.   These  images  delight  her  because  the  girls  look  so  much  alike.  The  photographs  hold   them  captive  in  time  when  they  were  smaller  and  more  vulnerable.  Living  in  a  miniature   world,  "one  relaxes  in  a  small  space.  This  is  one  of  the  daydreams  that  take  us  out  of  this   world  and  into  another"  (Bachelard  1994:  162).      

develops  his  theory  of  topo-analysis.

   Gloria  has  a  postcard  of  a  castle  in  Scotland  that  once  belonged  to  her  mother's   family.  She  brought  it  in  to  show  a  work  colleague  and  it  has  stayed  in  a  special  place   near  her  computer  screen.        Vibrant  colour  is  often  a  significant  aspect  of  the  collections  of  personalia,  as   they  offer  visual  contrast  and  colourful  intrusions  into  the  neutral  environment  of  the   desks.  Camila  talks  with  enthusiasm  about  her  bright  green  tape  dispenser,  as  the  colour   provides  her  with  great  pleasure.    "I  love  my  tape  dispenser,  it  is  green  and  brightens  up   my  desk."  The  work  surface  and  pinup  spaces  of  the  desks  define  the  limited  terrain  of   the  women  workers,  as  it  is  here  they  exercise  their  unselfconscious  desires  to  create   heterotopias38.          Habitus   When  I  questioned  the  women  about  their  comfort  with  the  lack  of  visual  privacy   afforded  by  low  screen  heights,  none  of  them  considered  this  to  be  a  problem.  In  fact,   they  seemed  to  enjoy  being  in  closer  proximity  to  their  team.    Instead  they  use  a  series   of  devices  to  accomplish  acoustic  privacy.  Headphones  can  help  isolate  the  worker  in   their  own  sound  bubble  (Bull  2004),  or  can  by  their  symbolic  presence  indicate  to  others   that  the  wearer  is  concentrating  and  shouldn't  be  interrupted.    This  adaption  creates  a   social  convention  that  informs  behaviour  in  the  group,  creating  a  habitus  (Bordieu,   1984).  The  headphones  become  a  symbol  that  communicates  do  not  interrupt  me.      Habitus  is  also  observable  in  the  social  behaviours  of  the  women  working  in   teams.    They  welcome  opportunities  to  consult  or  provide  advice  to  other  co-workers   and  use  it  as  a  chance  to  get  up  from  their  desks  and  stretch.      They  expressed   concerned  about  the  comfort  of  their  desk  chairs,  as  they  are  seated  for  long  stretches   of  time.  Their  need  to  move  around  was  reinforced  by  the  focus  on  Investors  Group's   weekly  activities  that  are  designed  to  provide  a  short  break  in  the  routine  and  engage   employees  in  social  activity.

   The  women  generally  enjoy  their  desk  as  their  home  place  at  work  and  express   few  issues  with  the  lack  of  privacy.  They  understand  this  way  of  working  is  required  by   IG  for  the  tasks  they  perform  daily.  However,  tactical  behaviours  and  spatial  practices   suggest  other  factors  are  at  work.        There  are  many  ways  in  which  routine  office  workers  are  held  in  stasis  in  the   workplace.  Tactics  are  most  visible  when  the  women  talk  about  the  difficulty  of  making   personal  calls.    They  employ  a  number  of  methods,  from  hiding  behind  their  screens  to   take  calls,  using  the  lift  lobby  or  one  of  the  meeting  rooms,  taking  time  at  lunch  to  go  to   the  mall  next  door,  or  flaunting  the  rules  completely.        The  need  for  space  to  make  private  calls  was  also  raised  in  most  of  the   interviews.  Taking  private  calls  at  an  individual's  desk  is  not  encouraged  at  Investors   Group  and  many  of  the  clerical  desks  don't  have  a  phone.  The  women  talk  about  making   a  trip  to  the  mall  at  lunchtime  to  use  their  cell  phones  in  private.  This  issue  becomes   more  problematic  as  cell  phones  become  ubiquitous  and  constant  communication  is  the   norm.    Camila  described  the  difficulty  she  had  when  she  was  buying  a  house  and  trying   to  maintain  contact  with  her  lawyer  and  the  bank  to  enact  a  confidential  transaction.     However,  everyday  communications  such  as  co-ordinating  children's  drop-offs  and  pick- ups  and  dental  and  medical  appointments  become  much  more  difficult  when  personal   organization  is  limited  to  the  lunch  hour.      This  negation  of  an  employee's  connection  to   her  family  seems  anachronistic.  It  reinforces  the  women's  sense  of  isolation  from  the   outside  world  and  explains  some  of  the  women's  behaviour.        Laura  sits  next  to  the  window  and  close  to  her  supervisor.  She  likes  to  take  a  few   moments  in  her  day  to  see  what  is  happening  outside  and  rest  her  eyes.    She  enjoys   connecting  to  the  outside  world  as  an  escape  from  the  space  of  consumption  and  the   clutter  of  the  working  world,  but  is  also  conscious  of  her  supervisor  watching  her.    The   prevalent  sense  of  disconnection  amongst  the  clerical  workers  heightens  the   importance  of  the  everyday.    Images  of  kids  and  pets,  humorous  green  frogs  and   cartoons,  and  coffee  mugs  offer  a  brief  escape  from  the  work  on  her  desk  or  the   opportunity  to  engage  in  a  conversation  with  a  friend.    The  personal  items  that  most      153  

  
women  have  at  their  desks,  such  as  hand  lotion,  nail  files  and  tissues,  remind  the   women  they  are  women  and  they  celebrate  the  shared  desire  to  look  and  feel  good.      Co-worker,  Team  Player   IG  has  an  active  social  committee  that  creates  a  social  network  by  scheduling   events  in  the  building.    The  events  allow  for  the  routines  of  the  office  to  be  briefly   interrupted  for  games,  team  events,  casual  dress  days  and  celebration  meals.  This   schedule  breaks  the  monotony  of  the  week  and  is,  for  many  of  the  women,  a  chance  to   move  away  from  their  desks,  renew  and  maintain  social  relationships,  and  relieve  the   stress  of  extended  working  hours  and  intense  screen-based  work.    Half  of  the  women   display  the  IG  social  events  calendar,  and  its  location  in  relation  to  their  computer   screen  indicates  how  important  these  events  are.  Events  include  jeans  day,  where   employees  donate  to  support  a  cause  and  in  return  they  are  allowed  to  wear  jeans  to   work.    The  employees  also  participate  in  fundraisers  for  cancer,  diabetes,  Rainbow   Society,  Christmas  Cheer  Board  and  Fire-fighters  Burn  Fund.    The  stickers  given  to   participants  are  usually  displayed  at  the  more  public  perimeter  of  the  desks  where  they   provide  markers  of  participation  in  the  organizational  culture.      The  women's  self-identity  is  formed  through  connection  to,  and  identification   with,  everyday  experience.  As  a  consequence  women  tend  to  look  for  connections   rather  than  dichotomies;  where  "boundaries  between  categories  such  as  public/private,   work/home,  and  male/female  tend  to  be  broken  down"  (Havenhand  2004:  39).      Mementoes  of  IG  sponsored  events  are  prominently  displayed  to  reinforce  team   membership  and  collegial  and  co-operative  values  that  are  a  part  of  women's  ways  of   knowing.  The  organization  relies  on  the  women's  desire  to  work  collaboratively  to   accomplish  the  complex  tasks  they  have  to  complete.  Although  there  is  a  lot  of   repetition  in  the  work,  individuals  become  experts  in  different  aspects  of  the  task  and   provide  support  and  information  for  newer  colleagues.    The  successful  completion  of   the  routine  tasks  that  comprise  their  day  involves  collaboration.  Each  employee  belongs   to  a  team  and  team-building  events  are  held  regularly  to  encourage  good      154  

  
communications  and  rapport.      The  women  signal  their  commitment  to  the  team  by   displaying  stickers,  magnetized  logos  and  slogans  at  the  perimeter  of  their  desks  where   they  are  more  visible  to  others  and  management.    Symbols  of  their  close  connections  to   and  relationships  with  other  workers  are  usually  displayed  closer  to  the  centre  of  the   desks  where  they  create  a  different  meaning,  one  with  more  emotional  content.  There   are  often  narratives  that  go  with  these  mementos;  narratives  of  friends,  former   employees,  colleagues  working  in  other  units  at  IG,  those  who  have  retired,  or   colleagues  who  have  moved  onto  new  jobs.            There  are  a  few  occasions  where  photographs  of  IG  events  or  certificates  to   celebrate  "work  anniversaries"  (years  working  fulltime  for  IG)  shift  closer  to  the  screen.   The  women  who  occupy  those  desks  value  these  symbols  of  recognition  relative  to  their   goals,  ambitions  and  sense  of  identity,  and  often  are  the  ones  are  earlier  in  their  careers   with  IG.    The  routine  clerical  workers  at  Investors  Group  begin  their  careers  as  contract   employees  and  work  toward  securing  a  permanent  position  with  benefits  and  vacations.      Family  Space  and  Private  Space      The  acceptance  of  subjectivity  and  feelings  as  a  strategy  is  one  of  the  attributes   of  women's  ways  of  knowing.  The  desktop  images  of  family  acknowledge  the   importance  of  familial  connections  as  a  strategy  for  negotiating  negative  emotions  and   stress  in  the  workplace.  Byron  and  Laurence's  recent  study  of  desktop  personalization   (2015)  would  support  this  by  referring  to  this  behaviour  as  self-regulating.  Self- regulating  behaviour  uses  desktop  personalia  to  modify  and  regulate  office  behaviour.   Photographs  of  children  were  most  often  identified  as  relievers  of  stress  and  as   motivators.        The  objects  on  the  desk  become  symbols  that  are  imbued  with  emotions  ranging   from  love  and  pleasure,  to  gratitude  and  friendship.    Symbols  can  become  a   representation  of  kindness  and  warmth.    Camila  says,  "Pictures  of  my  daughter  help  me   get  through  the  day,  on  a  bad  day  they  help  me  cope."  Amanda  talks  about  her  desk   with  its  many  photographs  of  her  "kids'  smiley  faces"  and  husband  as  "a  happy  spot  on      155  

  
days  that  are  not  so  good".  She  is  a  crafter  and  has  made  a  number  of  the  things  at  her   desk  that  incorporate  her  own  creativity  with  special  words  and  favourite  photos  of   family  to  give  special  interest  and  meaning.  For  Amanda  these  handmade  objects  and   family  images  make  her  desk  a  home  place  because,  as  she  notes  wistfully,  "I  spend   more  time  at  work  than  at  home."      Sharon,  an  older  worker  recovering  from  bypass  surgery,  has  photos  at  her  desk   that  she  is  happy  to  talk  about.  One  is  of  herself  with  Santa  at  an  IG  Christmas  breakfast   event,  and  others  are  pictures  of  her  grandchildren  who  don't  live  in  the  city.  "I  like  to   have  them  at  my  desk."  The  grandchildren's  pictures  are  on  the  left  side  of  the  desk   located  near  the  screen.  However,  it  is  the  gifts  from  co-workers  returning  from   vacations,  Kinder  Surprise  toys,  and  humorous  cartoons  that  she  identifies  as  stress   relievers.  "I  just  look  at  them  and  they  make  me  feel  less  stressed."  Having  developed   close  friendships  over  her  18  years  at  IG,  Sharon  remembers  the  particular  kindness  of   two  co-workers  who  visited  her  in  cardiac  rehab  and  brought  her  a  pedometer.  She  says   she  likes  to  look  at  the  personalia  at  her  desk  and  be  reminded  of  the  givers.  The   women  talk  about  their  children  as  the  reason  they  do  this  job;  for  Rose  who  has  no   children,  employee  recognition  awards  and  a  card  celebrating  her  first  anniversary  with   IG  motivates  her.      Camila  has  a  young  daughter  whose  handprints  decorate  her  workspace  in  a  bold   and  graphic  orange.  She  made  a  copy  of  the  prints  for  her  husband  too  so  they  could   both  display  them  in  their  workspace,  creating  a  connection  that  serves  to  link  them  all   when  they  are  apart.  Photographs  of  her  husband  and  daughter  at  various  ages  are  to   the  right  side  of  her  screen.  Family  is  obviously  important  and  when  I  ask  her  about  the   images,  she  tells  me  co-workers  "like  to  see  the  children  growing  up"  and  appreciate   current  pictures.    She  keeps  some  toys  at  her  desk,  such  as  a  bright  green  frog  and  koala   bears  with  Australian  flags.  "The  toys  remind  me  of  my  daughter,  I  miss  her  during  the   day."        Gloria,  an  older  worker,  describes  her  desk  as  her  "home  away  from  home".     Preferring  to  work  with  her  back  to  the  busyness  of  the  office,  she  has  created  her  own      156  

  
private  corner.  "Don't  anybody  come  and  move  my  stuff,  I  know  where  everything  is  on   my  desk!"  She  is  protective  of  her  cache  of  markers  and  sticky  notes  and  offers  a   warning  to  those  who  might  borrow  things  from  her  desk.    She  resolutely  claims  her   desk  space  as  her  own;  "the  things  I  have  here  are  for  me."  She  is  close  to  retirement   and  is  distancing  herself  from  the  camaraderie  and  new  friendships  required  to  actively   participate  in  the  office  environment.      Rose  thinks  it  is  important  to  have  personal  space  at  her  desk  and  "want(s)  it  to   reflect  who  I  am".  She  is  young,  tidy  and  organized.  She  "likes  to  keep  folders  neatly   aligned"  and  tends  to  her  appearance  in  a  small  mirror  tucked  behind  her  monitor.        Conclusion      "The  making  of  space  draws  attention  to  bodily  performance  and  experience.  

Workplaces  and  spaces  are  not  just  made  by  meaning  or  what  people  think  but  also  by   what  they  do  and  how  this  is  experienced  bodily"  (Halford  2008:  939).      The  analysis  of  the  case  studies  demonstrates  the  integrated  ways  in  which  the   women  interviewed  bring  their  ways  of  knowing  and  their  operations  to  bear  on  the   small  personal  spaces  of  the  desktop.      Tactics  for  subverting  office  supplies  to  create  a  currency,  imbued  with  memory   and  place,  are  made  evident,  as  are  the  ways  they  operate  to  recognize,  support  and   appreciate  their  co-workers.  A  web  of  relationships  implicates  family,  friends,  employers   and  co-workers  in  a  miniature  world  where  an  ethic  of  care  connects  them  all.   This  chapter  demonstrates  that  the  creation  of  a  "home  place"  at  the  women's  desks   draws  upon  women's  ways  of  knowing  in  the  workplace.  The  case  study  research  into   these  intimate  spaces  suggests  they  reflect  individual  attempts  to  construct,  modify  and   contest  the  cultural  field  of  the  office.  The  workspaces  communicate  the  individual   women's  values,  identities  and  priorities  through  the  personalia  at  their  desks,  their   arrangement,  and  the  social  networks  and  relations  they  represent.

   To  access  ideas  of  agency  this  dissertation  draws  on  Michel  de  Certeau's  theories   and  ethnography  to  understand  the  everyday  experience  of  workers.  It  looks  at  the   tactics  and  techniques  they  employ  to  creatively  manipulate  the  conceived  space  of  the   neoliberal  organization.

      CONCLUSION     
The  research  underscores  the  significance  of  micro-spatial  practices  in  relation  to   the  study  of  the  everyday.  The  case  study  research  into  desktops  and  pin  boards   demonstrates  individual  attempts  to  construct,  modify  and  contest  the  organizational   culture  of  the  office.  The  arrangement  of  personalia  in  the  women's  personal  space  is   expressive  of  their  values,  identities  and  priorities.  This  research  provides  a  source  of  rich   phenomenological  information  that  could  inform  the  design  and  management  of  spaces   that  better  accommodate  women,  and  could  be  used  to  evaluate  office  environments.   Designers  and  managers  of  work  environments  need  to  understand  differential  space  as  a   space  of  tension  and  potential  and  women's  operations  that  "reappropriate  spaces   organized  by  techniques  of  sociocultural  production"  (de  Certeau  1988:  xiv).   The  routine  clerical  workers  do  not  currently  have  the  choice  and  control   available  to  knowledge  workers  with  mobile  technologies;  they  work  in  offices  isolated  by   the  space  of  flows.  I  support  Halford's  recommendation  that  "we  should  pay  far  more   attention  to  the  agency  of  individuals  and  groups  in  responding  to  organisational  space"   (2008:  932).   This  dissertation  addresses  the  questions  that  were  framed  in  the  introduction.   ·    How  does  the  physical  environment  of  the  workplace,  the  desk  and  its  personalia   reflect  the  creation  of  identities  and  the  women's  values  in  response  to  the  hegemony  of   the  financial  services  industry?   ·    How  does  the  workplace  reflect  women's  values,  and  how  have  women's  values   The  head  offices  of  Investors  Group  at  One  Canada  Place,  Winnipeg,  are  an   environment  that  functions  essentially  as  it  was  designed  and  occupied  in  1987.  But  it  is   not  unusual;  the  work  environment  designed  for  routine  clerical  workers  often  speaks  of      159   influenced  the  design  of  the  workplace?  

  
colourless  conformity.    Jacqueline  Vischer  has  observed  "ever  growing  numbers  of  office   workers  now  sit  at  terminals  for  most  of  their  working  day  and  are  often  the  least   comfortable  group  in  the  building"  (1999:  34).    There  is  a  need  for  greater  focus  on   clerical  positions  and  data  processors  in  offices.    These  employees  are  often  hired  on  a   contract  basis  and  usually  have  no  voice  in  the  design  process.  The  design  process  that   produces  conceived  space  needs  to  carefully  consider  the  needs  of  employees  who  are   spending  a  minimum  of  40  hours  a  week  at  a  desk  with  limited  control  over  their  work   environment.  Ellis  points  out  in  Vischer's  Environment  as  a  Tool  for  Work  that  good  space   planning  solutions  lie  more  in  good  planning  process  than  in  seeking  out  the  "best  fit"   physical  layout.  Vischer  advocates  for  a  negotiation  process  that  "allows  managers  to   respond  to  intrinsic  as  well  as  to  extrinsic  pressures  for  change"  (1999:  40).          Personalia     The  research  uncovers  the  significance  of  the  location  of  personalia  at  the  desk.     This  is  a  unique  research  finding.  The  space  immediately  around  the  screen  is  where   items  identified  by  the  women  as  being  more  personally  significant  were  located.  They   are  less  visible  to  co-workers  and  are  in  the  peripheral  vision  of  the  women  as  they  work.   It  is  also  the  location  for  regularly  used  codes,  phone  contacts  and  work-related  shortcuts.   As  personalia  moves  away  from  the  screen  location  it  is  described  more  often  in  terms  of   co-workers'  responses,  but  may  still  represent  family  members,  children,  holiday   snapshots,  and  cute  and  odd  items  brought  to  work  that  provoke  comments  and   reactions  from  co-workers  (see  figure  6C).  The  need  to  protect  personal  identity  may  be   seen  as  a  way  of  operating,  where  desk  space  is  appropriated  for  the  expression  of   emotions,  private  memories  or  deeply  felt  connections  to  others.   In  recent  research  into  desk  personalization  across  11  countries,  Uta  Brandes   and  Michael  Erlhoff  (2011)  found  that  women  had  a  significantly  higher  preference  for   collecting  objects  than  their  male  counterparts.    They  counted  5,885  objects  on  351  desks   belonging  to  female  workers  and  3,361  objects  on  335  desks  belonging  to  male  workers.   However  you  might  interpret  these  numbers  it  is  obvious  that  the  desire  to  express      160  

  
individuality  and  values  in  the  limited  space  of  the  work  desk  is  a  human  need  that  should   be  recognized  and  accommodated.      Space  for  Social  Networks           The  offices  that  were  the  focus  of  the  research  at  Investors  Group  have  the   benefit  of  lots  of  natural  light  and  generous  spatial  allocations  typical  of  the  1980s,  but   the  clerical  space  is  laid  out  with  rows  of  low  height  partitions  that  create  cubicles,   clustered  to  reflect  the  priority  for  teamwork  and  easy  consultation  at  the  desk.     Women's  preferred  ways  of  operating  value  social  networks  and  connectedness  to   others.  This  was  reinforced  by  the  research,  which  found  that  the  women  understand  IG's   priority  for  collaboration  and  find  ways  to  make  this  work,  including  the  creation  of  a   habitus  around  the  wearing  of  headphones.  Collaborative  practices  are  a  fundamental   part  of  contemporary  management  theory  that  aligns  well  with  women's  values.           There  is  an  obvious  need  for  the  women  to  be  able  to  enjoy  a  place  at  work  that   has  meaning  for  them.  A  place  that  honours  the  formal  and  informal  social  networks  so   evident  in  the  personalia  on  their  desktops.  They  need  a  communal  space,  close  to  the   open  office,  a  comfortable  lounge  for  social  networking  that  allows  employees  to  relax   and  unwind  during  their  breaks.  It  should  be  provided  with  facilities  for  making  coffee  and   sharing  food.    The  newly  completed  canteen  at  IG  was  only  mentioned  by  one  employee   as  a  favourite  space.  It  is  located  on  the  second  floor  and  has  nice  views  of  the  city  but  it   has  been  designed  to  accommodate  large  groups  and  it  feels  impersonal  and  institutional.   There  are  many  strategies  that  designers  can  employ.  Management  can  also   work  with  employees  to  create  a  more  positive  energy  at  their  workspaces  that  would  be   of  great  benefit  for  women  working  long  hours  in  stasis  at  their  desks.  In  1985  sociologists   looking  at  workplace  suggested  that  "energetic  diversity  in  offices  excites  innovation,   communication,  and  healthy  cooperation"  (Williams,  Armstrong  and  Clark  1985:  68).   Strategies  that  allow  for  the  greater  use  of  colour,  greater  diversity  in  the  design  of   furniture,  and  the  capacity  to  personalize  and  modify  the  configuration  of  desks  and   chairs  could  be  implemented.  This  would  greatly  improve  working  conditions.      161  

  
   Social  Networks,  Friends  and  Co-workers   The  friendships  that  develop  at  IG  are  of  significant  importance  to  the  women.     Co-workers  become  friends,  and  intrarelationships  become  interrelationships  as  workers   move  in  and  out  of  the  department  and  around  the  organization.  Work  friendships   present  and  past  are  recognized  and  honoured  at  the  desk.      Belonging  to  a  work  team  and  participating  in  IG  social  events  are  identified  and   owned  at  the  desk  as  valued  aspects  of  the  women's  work  identity.  Gifts  and  recognition   for  long  hours  and  special  effort,  as  well  as  work  anniversaries,  are  often  displayed  with   pride  to  demonstrate  and  acknowledge  their  value  to  the  women.  I  was  not  expecting  to   find  so  much  of  the  desk  dedicated  to  social  networks  associated  with  work,  and  was   fascinated  to  uncover  the  rituals  associated  with  departing  workers  poaching  office   supplies  to  be  gifted  to  co-workers.  The  narratives  of  the  Jawa  and  the  bowling  cup  mark   out  individuals  as  keepers  of  the  symbols  of  office  friendships  and  continuity.      Choice  and  Control         Choice  and  control  are  consistently  identified  in  environmental  research  as   significant  to  productivity  and  satisfaction.    So  it  was  no  surprise  to  find  this  was  also   evident  in  the  women's  spaces,  from  the  rituals  for  cleaning  the  work  surface  to  the   general  frustration  about  the  lack  of  consideration  of  privacy  when  making  personal  calls.   Social  expectations  of  being  in  constant  contact  have  changed  dramatically  from  1987  but   the  space  has  not  accommodated  this  change.         The  organization  needs  to  consider  many  more  ways  to  give  employees  control,   from  managing  excess  daylight  in  their  workspaces,  to  having  places  to  stretch  and  rest   their  eyes  after  hours  spent  in  focused  work  at  the  desk.  These  employees  may  have  very   little  in  the  way  of  status  in  the  company,  but  their  work  is  critical  to  the  IG's  success  and   they  will  value  the  investment  in  their  comfort.    Desk  spaces  should  be  provided  with   adequate  pinup  space  that  encourages  employees  to  participate  in  growing  the  social   networks  of  organizations  in  unstructured  and  organic  ways.      162  

  
Better  maintenance  of  washrooms  and  providing  a  greater  number  of  washroom   stalls  per  floor  would  considerably  improve  the  women's  perceptions  of  the  working   environment.  Facilities  such  as  an  in-house  gym,  yoga  studio  and  emergency  daycare   facilities  should  be  offered  to  support  clerical  employees  in  managing  their  health  and   family  responsibilities.  A  supervised  home  workroom  for  the  children  of  employees   working  overtime  would  allow  families  to  share  child-minding  responsibilities  more   equitably.   Office  furniture  that  allows  the  worker  to  change  position  would  provide  greater   control  and  choice  for  the  women.  Carefully  considering  the  selection  of  alternative   working  positions  and  chairs  with  better  ergonomics  are  especially  important  for  older   workers.  Adjustable  work  surfaces  at  the  computer  would  allow  the  worker  to  move   easily  from  sitting  to  standing  over  the  course  of  a  day.  Recent  research  in  the  United   Kingdom  (Buckley,  Hedge  and  Yates  2015)  suggests  that  the  sedentary  office  has  become   a  health  issue  that  increases  the  risk  of  cardio-metabolic  diseases  and  premature   mortality.    The  UK  has  launched  a  program  called  "Get  Britain  Standing"  as  a  response.           Family   Family  photos  and  friendships  are  primary  sources  of  motivation  and  relieve   stress,  helping  the  women  to  cope  with  the  pressures  of  the  constant  work.  They  imbue   the  women  with  status  as  aunts  and  mothers,  grandmothers  and  friends.  They  connect   the  women  to  their  loved  ones,  to  happy  memories  and  life  away  from  the  office.  The   personalia  at  the  desk  generally  have  little  monetary  value,  but  are  instead  valued  for   bringing  colour  and  detail  to  the  desk  and  creating  home  places  for  the  women.    They   demonstrate  the  individual's  values  but  they  also  show  a  playful  and  less  serious  side.   Some  women  have  accumulated  many  objects  at  their  desk  and  like  the  busyness  of   them;  they  take  great  care  in  arranging  the  objects  on  their  desks.  Others  have  very  little   on  their  desks  and  are  judged  by  some  co-workers  for  not  providing  a  work  identity  for

others'  consumption  and  comment.  There  are  tactics  for  dealing  with  the  culture  of   display,  as  the  dolphin  ornament  seems  to  be  a  substitute  for  photographs  of  loved  ones.      Identity   Identities  are  multiple.  They  are  demonstrations  of  the  individual  as  a  person   who  values  friendship,  has  a  sense  of  humour,  loves  nature,  likes  the  colour  green,   appreciates  recognition  from  their  boss  or  IG,  does  their  job  professionally,  cares  about   others  and  likes  to  have  fun.  The  collections  of  personalia  at  the  desk  are  representations   of  complex  identities  and  narratives.  Identity  includes  places  of  origin,  oneiric  symbols  of   home  such  as  the  christening  ornaments,  an  ancestor's  English  castle  or  an  Asian  fruit.  All   are  significant  markers  of  familiarity  and  comfort,  reminders  of  places  where  our  birth   identity  is  secured.  The  Canadian  flag  is  a  symbol  of  IG's  recognition  of  citizenship  and  is  a   source  of  pride  for  the  women.  It  speaks  of  formal  acceptance  into  Canadian  society  and   attests  to  the  meaning  of  belonging  in  the  women's  lives.        Home  places  and  Heterotopias   Desks  become  home  places  and  ideal  worlds  or  heterotopias,  where  the  women   can  exercise  a  sense  of  control  and  indulge  in  daydreams  that  provide  relief  from  the   stress  of  the  continuous  flow  of  work  at  their  desks.  Personalia  that  cluster  around  the   screen  are  often  symbols  of  life  away  from  the  office,  crossing  boundaries  between  work   life  and  home  life.  They  come  with  stories  of  how  they  were  acquired,  perhaps  as  gifts   from  children,  co-workers  or  team  leaders.  Other  objects  at  the  desk  are  randomly   acquired,  left  behind  or  part  of  a  collection  now  dispersed.  They  also  have  ebb  and  flow   as  mobile  symbols  of  continuity.  Cleanliness  and  tidiness  become  a  performance  of  moral   virtues  for  some  of  the  women;  for  one  individual  it  relates  to  allergies,  and  for  others  the   ritual  brings  closure  to  the  work  of  the  day.                 164  

  
Research  Methods   The  research  emphasizes  the  importance  of  inclusive  design  considerations  that   inform  programming  and  reinforces  the  significance  of  the  messages  that  are  imparted  to   the  women  working  in  these  spaces.  Rich  phenomenological  data  established  by  engaged   research  helps  to  build  a  more  complex  picture  of  values  and  operations.         Photo-elicitation  research  provides  a  productive  and  powerful  point  of  access  for   research  at  the  micro-scale.  I  was  able  to  access  and  uncover  spatial,  social,  and  personal   practices  and  ways  of  operating  that  are  not  evident  in  other  studies  of  the  workplace,   proving  Halford's  assertion  that  "spatial  discourse  shapes  the  production  of  working   selves  ­  who  we  are  at  work  and  how  we  understand  our  working  identities"  (2008:  932).     Much  of  the  research  that  addresses  the  workplace  looks  at  the  imposition  of  behaviours   and  subjectivities  through  organizational  space.  My  research  approach  is  purposefully   looking  for  agency  in  the  claiming  and  occupation  of  space  by  women  with  little  power   and  status.  This  research  represents  point  of  entry  into  the  ways  women  create  identities   and  social  networks  in  the  contemporary  workplace.           The  prospect  that  routine  clerical  work  would  be  taken  over  by  computers  has   not  been  realized  and  the  routine  tasks  that  require  human  decision-making  and  critical   oversight  remain  the  work  of  routine  clerical  workers.  "Many  lower-level  women's  jobs   that  cannot  be  automated  still  require  high  skill  and  responsibility,  but  are  devalued  in   our  society  and  vastly  under  rewarded."  (Aker  1992:62)   At  IG  women  represent  74%  of  the  clerical  workforce  (Verdonck  2015:   pers.comm.).  The  work  is  referred  to  as  "on-boarding",  as  opposed  to  "outsourcing",  and   IG  suggests  it  will  be  a  part  of  the  financial  services  industry  for  the  foreseeable  future.   This  research  seeks  to  add  to  the  critical  literature  on  the  workplace  by  studying  the   creation  of  identity  and  meaning  at  the  desks  of  these  clerical  workers  who  are  left  in  the   wake  of  a  mobile  society.     I  am  interested  in  the  influence  of  women  on  the  essentially  "masculine"  nature   of  the  office  and  its  design.  I  argue  that  the  outcome  of  the  shift  in  gender  and   management  philosophies,  supported  by  the  influence  of  the  newly-professionalized      165  

  
interior  designer,  resulted  in  the  emergence  of  an  office  environment  in  the  1980s  and   90s  that  became  more  closely  aligned  with  women's  preferred  ways  of  working.     But  it  becomes  clear  that  the  innovation  in  office  design  since  that  time  has   largely  effected  the  design  of  knowledge  workers  spaces.  The  working  lives  of  routine   office  employees  have  received  much  less  attention  from  designers.    As  lower  paid  and   often  contracted  employees,  these  women  are  less  visible  to  management  and  are   perceived  to  be  less  critical  to  the  company's  bottom  line.         In  conclusion,  women  and  women's  culture  has  been  widely  studied  in  relation   to  domestic  environments  (Sparke  1995,  Lupton  1996,  Colomina  1996)  my  research  shifts   the  focus  to  the  understudied  area  of  personalia  in  the  office  environment  in  an  attempt   to  generate  attention  and  interest  in  its  potential  as  the  site  for  feminist  cultural  studies   research.

   APPENDIX  ONE      Research  Proposal    
WORKPLACE  RESEARCH  PROJECT  :      The  proposed  research  project,  with  Insurance  company  employees,  will  form  the  basis   of  Associate  Professor  Lynn  Chalmers'  PhD  dissertation  "Everyday  Spaces  of  Routine   Work:  a  critical  study".    Her  thesis  advisor  is  Dr  Janine  Marchessault  ,  from  York   University  Ontario  (contact  information  below).      Research  Ethics  Approval  has  been  given  by  Ryerson  University  Ethics  Committee  for  the     the  following  project  which  seeks  to  answer  the  questions  below:      · What  is  the  significance  of  identity  and  personalization  in  routine  workers   environments?   · How  is  individual  identity  accommodated  in  the  contemporary  workplace?   · How  does  the  individual  make  meaning  in  the  workplace  environment?            The  beneficiaries  of  the  research  will  be  designers  of  workplace  environments  and  the   routine  workers  for  whom  they  design.  The  research  project  will  provide  a  better   understanding  of  an  increasingly  diverse  workforce  and  their  needs  for  identity  and   personalization.  A  detailed  study  of  the  individual  in  their  work  setting  should  provide   the  knowledge  to  create  a  more  responsive  workplace,  for  a  wider  range  of  routine   workers,  who  often  have  limited  flexibility  in  work  tasks  and  locations.        The  study  will  involve  four  departments  and  ten  subjects  in  each  department,  40   subjects  in  all.    The  researcher,  Lynn  Chalmers  is  from  the  University  of  Manitoba,   Faculty  of  Architecture,  and  will  carry  out  the  research  in  late  October  and  early   November.    The  project  will  involve  observation  of  four  departments,  for  a  period  of  2   hours  each.  Floor  plans  of  each  department  studied  will  be  required.  A  number  of   research  subjects  will  be  identified  and  offered  the  opportunity  to  discuss  their  personal   workspace  in  detail.    The  subjects  will  be  selected  to  represent  a  diverse  range  of   workers  particularly  in  consideration  of  age,  ethnicity,  gender,  and  ways  of  responding   to  the  environment  that  they  occupy.   An  outline  of  the  questions  forming  the  basis  of  the  discussion  (see  below  )  will  be   supplied  to  the  selected  subjects  so  that  they  will  understand  the  nature  of  the   discussion,  if  they  choose  to  participate.    They  will  have  the  opportunity  to  withdraw  at   any  time  from  the  research,  or  they  can  refuse  to  answer  any  of  the  questions  without   consequence  if  they  decide  to  participate.   Interview/discussions  will  take  place  at  the  subjects'  workspace,  at  a  time  negotiated   with  the  department  leadership  and  the  individual  concerned.   The  discussion  will  take  30  minutes  for  each  subject.    The  researcher  will  request  the   participants'  permission  to  photograph  the  space,  as  the  visual  configuration  of  the      179  

  
space  is  a  significant  component  of  the  research.    Subjects  will  not  be  identified  in  the   research.

Were  you  born  in  Canada?   How  many  years  have  you  been  employed  by  the  company?   How  long  have  you  worked  in  this  department?   How  long  have  you  been  located  at  this  workstation?   What  do  you  do  when  you  want  to  work  on  a  project  that  requires  greater   concentration?   What  do  you  do  to  make  your  workstation  more  private  ?   Are  you  required  to  collaborate  to  do  aspects  of  your  work?   How  and  where  do  you  do  team  work?   Would  you  describe  the  work  you  do  as  routine?   Are  there  rules  about  what  you  can  display  at  your  work  station?   What  sorts  of  personal  items  can  you  have  at  your  desk?   Are  the  display  of  personal  items  important  to  you  ?  why?   Which  personal  items  are  important  to  you?    why  are  they  important?   Could  you  describe  5  items  on  display  at  your  desk?   Do  the  items  mostly  celebrate  work  events  ?  or  family  and  friends  from  outside  work?   Is  the  display  for  your  benefit  only,  or  does  the  display  say  something  important  about   you  to  your  co-workers?   What  is  your  favorite  place  at  work  ­  why  ?   If  you  could  make  change  in  your  immediate  work  environment  what  would  it  be?            180
