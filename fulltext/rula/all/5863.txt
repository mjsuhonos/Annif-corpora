he advent and rapid adoption of new technologies, such as machine learning and advanced robotics, have resurfaced concerns over technology eliminating jobs. Many now worry that more jobs are at risk than ever before.1 However, this debate all too o en ignores the complexity of technology's relationship to labour. Technological advancements throughout Canada's history have helped to drive innovation and raise productivity, improve wealth and increase consumption, and give rise to entirely new industries and economic opportunities.2 3 4 As a result, in the long run, technology has o en helped to produce more jobs than it destroyed.5 Whether or not this trend continues, technology will continue to change the kinds of jobs available and the skills they require. This can take a toll on workers lling roles that can largely be substituted by technology.56 Canada has already witnessed drastic shi s in the composition of its labour market, partially driven by technological change. In the 1980s and 1990s, advances in information communications technology (ICT) reduced the need for many routine tasks across the economy, such as the calculations performed by many bookkeepers. At the same time, these technologies helped improve the productivity of jobs demanding creativity, complex-problem solving and interpersonal interaction, such as those lled by lawyers, managers and scientists. These changes contributed to larger employment shares for both high and low-skilled workers in Canada, at the expense of the middle-skilled.7 The regional implications of these changes can be striking. Take for example the impact of industrial robotics on employment in highly concentrated manufacturing towns and cities. In Canada, it took 20 jobs to generate $1 million in manufacturing output in 1980. By 2013, this number had been cut in half.8

A recent study from the United States (US) demonstrates that between 1990 and 2007, the introduction of one robot per 1,000 workers reduced employment by nearly six individuals, resulting in upwards of 670,000 jobs lost.9 While these technologies have been fundamental in improving the productivity of manufacturing across the industrial world, the brunt of this change has been felt by workers in routine jobs in the manufacturing sector. Modern breakthroughs, such as natural language processing and autonomous vehicle technology, mean that machines are now performing a whole new set of tasks, potentially more e ciently and e ectively than humans. Current predictions suggest that these technologies are likely to disproportionately a ect lower paying, lower skilled jobs.10 The impact of technological trends will not be consistent across the country. To help identify which cities and towns in Canada are most susceptible to modern advances in technology, the Brook eld Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (BII+E) translated ndings from a recent McKinsey Global Institute report to the Canadian context--mapping automation impact data against Canadian cities and towns, and examining trends to extract relevant insights. The goal of this data insights report is to begin to map the uneven distribution of risks and bene ts associated with automation, and to uncover some of the regional tensions that exist between innovation driven growth and inclusive growth in Canada. While the data highlights that certain cities and towns in Canada are more susceptible to automation than others, it also suggests that, as a result of the increasing capacity of technology and fairly similar regional economies, technology has the potential to automate a large number of work activities across the country.

M C K I N S E Y D ATA McKinsey's recent report, A Future That Works: Automation, Employment and Productivity, identi ed the proportion of work with the potential to be automated using current technology. McKinsey examined labour force data across 54 countries covering 78 percent of the global labour market.11 McKinsey's report departed from earlier studies by examining the potential for automation of speci c work activities, rather than entire occupations. Within each occupation, an individual performs a variety of tasks, some of which are susceptible to automation, some of which are not. As a result, an examination of automation risk at the occupational level can overstate potential impacts.12 To assess the technical potential for automation, McKinsey disaggregated occupations into 18 capabilities, which were categorized into ve groups: sensory perception, cognitive capabilities, natural language processing, social and emotional capabilities, and physical capabilities. The level of performance required to successfully carry out each work activity in each occupation (i.e. the median human level, or top 25th percentile) was then estimated and compared to the performance of existing technologies. This enabled analysis of the potential for automation across more than 2,000 work activities for more than 800 US occupations. McKinsey then applied this framework across the global economy.13 McKinsey estimated that 50 percent of work activities around the globe can be automated by adapting existing technology, representing $14.6 trillion (USD) in wages. However, less than ve percent of occupations can be fully automated.14 Routine work activities were found to be most at risk, including predictable physical work, prevalent in manufacturing and retail trades, as well as work involving processing and collecting data,

found across the spectrum of skills and wages.15 In contrast, activities such as managing others and applying expertise remain relatively resistant to automation.16 However, McKinsey also recognized that just because work can technically be automated, it does not necessarily mean that it will be. McKinsey identi ed ve sets of factors that will impact the adoption of technology: technical feasibility; cost of developing and deploying solutions; labour market dynamics such as the supply, demand and cost of human labour; economic bene ts such as productivity gains, quality and pro t; as well as regulatory and social acceptance.17

S TAT I S T I C S C A N A D A D ATA To apply McKinsey ndings to Canadian labour force data, we used Statistics Canada's National Household Survey (NHS), 2011. The NHS provides the latest data currently available on employment gures at the necessary geographic level. It was a voluntary survey for which approximately 4.5 million households received a questionnaire and includes social, economic and geographic information. The NHS provides data for all of Canada's Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) and Census Agglomerations (CAs). These include one or more adjacent municipalities, with a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000 with a minimum of 50,000 living in the core. A CA must have a core population of at least 10,000. While large parts of Canada's geography are not captured by CMAs and CAs, the vast majority of Canada's population is. In 2011, workers in Canada's CMAs and CAs constituted roughly 83 percent of the country's total labour force. However, due to low population density, data for Canada's North is particularly limited. The NHS has a number of limitations. First and foremost, the data is six years old and therefore does not re ect recent shi s in Canada's labour market. Second, the survey was not mandatory and therefore departed from the methodologies of

3

previous censuses. As a result, the non-response rate was signi cantly higher. At the national level, the Global Non-Response Rate (GNR) was 26.1 percent, compared to the 6.5 percent in the 2006 long form census. Non-response rates can be much higher for smaller geographic regions. There are also non-response biases present in the survey, as certain groups such as low-income individuals are less likely to respond to the survey.18 As a result, these ndings are designed to help to set the context and begin to identify areas that are most and least likely to be impacted by automation. To mitigate data limitations and provide a more up-to-date labour market picture, BII+E plans to update this analysis with 2016 Census data upon its public release.

manufacturing presence, this region may require a higher proportion of highly skilled workers, which could make it less susceptible to automation. The data used for this report will not re ect these di erences. We also investigated the industrial diversity of CMAs and CAs using a "diversity index". This index enabled us to rank a CMA or CA as either diverse,if the distribution of employment in 2011 across all two-digit industry codes is similar to Canada as a whole, or less diverse,if the distribution of employment is more concentrated.19 The diversity index is calculated as follows:

For each country studied, McKinsey identi ed the proportion of work activities in each industry with the potential to be automated. To conduct our analysis, we applied these gures to the number of individuals employed in each industry in every Canadian CMA and CA. This enabled us to identify the proportion of work activities with the potential to be automated across all Canadian CMAs and CAs. We compared these proportions against the national average to create a location quotient. A location quotient greater than one signals that the region's concentration of work activities with the potential to be automated is greater than the national average. In contrast, a location quotient less than one signals that the region's concentration of work activities with the potential to be automated is less than the national average. However, there are limitations with this approach. In particular, using McKinsey's industry data at a subnational level assumes that the occupational composition of each industry, in each CMA or CA, re ects the national average, which may not always be true. For example, in certain regions such as Kitchener-Waterloo, Ont., there is a thriving advanced manufacturing industry. Compared to other regions with a signi cant

In this formula, Diversity j is the index unique to a CMA or CA, comparable to all other CMAs and CAs across Canada. The CMA or CA is denoted by j, and industry by i. A higher value in the index indicates that employment in the particular CMA or CA is less diverse compared to Canada as a whole.

P OT E N T I A L F O R A U TO M AT I O N ACROSS CANADIAN INDUSTRIES The potential for automation varies greatly between industries in Canada--ranging from 30 percent of work activities in educational services to 69 percent in accommodation and food services. Overall, 46 percent of work activities in Canada have the potential to be automated, across all industries; this is equivalent to 7.7 million jobs.i
i. The equivalent number of jobs with the potential to be automated is calculated by multiplying the number of employees in an industry by the proportion of work activities in that industry with the potential for automation. This gure does not indicate that this number of jobs have the potential to be automated, since the proportion of work activities in each industry is spread across many occupations. Instead, it is designed to give an indication of the potential extent of automation impacts in each sector.

The industries with the highest proportion of work activities that are technically automatable (top quartile) were classi ed as highly susceptible to automation. These industries are: accommodation and food services; transportation and warehousing; manufacturing; mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; and agriculture, forestry, shing and hunting. Across Canada, the proportion of work activities in these industries with the potential to be automated is equivalent to 2.5 million jobs.20 The industries least susceptible to automation (bo om quartile) are: educational services; professional, scienti c and technical services; health care and social assistance; and information and cultural industries. Collectively, more Canadians are employed in these industries, accounting for 28 percent of Canada's total employment, compared to the industries most susceptible to automation, accounting for 24

percent of total employment. However, automation can still impact the equivalent of over 1.6 million jobs in these relatively insulated industries.21

INDUSTRY DIVERSITY In addition to examining which industries are more susceptible to automation, we are also interested in how other factors--such as industrial diversity--could exacerbate or inhibit any negative implications of automation on the labour force. It is likely that smaller cities and towns, heavily reliant on one industry or employer, will experience automation di erently from either larger or more diversi ed economies, regardless of the proportion of work activities with the potential to be automated. These areas may have a lesser ability to reabsorb displaced labour. Their local economies

5

are also more exposed to automation risk, as a decision to adopt technology on the part of one large employer, or several employers in a dominant industry, would have a much larger impact than it would in a city or town with greater industry diversity.22

The CMAs and CAs ranking highest in the diversity index are largely found in the Prairie Provinces, specializing in oil and gas extraction. They include: Wood Bu alo, Alta., with a diversity index of 26.6, Estevan, Sask., with a diversity index of 26.5, and Cold Lake, Alta., with a diversity index of 22.9. The average diversity index score across all Canadian CMAs and CAs is 8.6.

Figure 2 helps to visualize the uneven distribution of risks associated with automation across Canada based on the concentration of work activities that could be automated. A number of smaller towns and cities specializing in manufacturing, mining, quarrying, or oil and gas extraction appear most at risk. These towns are found primarily in Alberta and Saskatchewan, as well as southern Ontario and Quebec.

Manufacturing employment has already felt the impacts of industrial robotics around the world. However, automation is projected to continue to impact the sector.23 A recent study showed that Canada ranks relatively low when it comes to the density of robots (robots per 10,000 workers) in the manufacturing sector, compared to international peers such as South Korea, Germany or Sweden.24 This may indicate that Canada's manufacturing industry has room to expand when it comes to adopting this productivity enhancing technology. For many of Canada's small and medium-sized manufacturing rms, the decline in the price of industrial robotics, which from 1990-2005 fell by approximately one half across six major developed

economies, could enable increased robot adoption.25 Even though manufacturing has traditionally been the focus of the automation discourse, cities and towns specializing in oil, gas and other extractive industries may also be highly susceptible to these trends. Recent employment declines in these industries, particularly in Alberta, have largely been the result of exogenous shocks to oil prices, not automation.26 However, advances in labour saving technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, are predicted to inhibit a return to pre-shock employment levels in Alberta's oil industry, even as it recovers from the downturn.27

The most susceptible CMAs and CAs in Canada are primarily small in population size. The average population of the 20 most susceptible CMAs and CAs is about 29,000. While these towns are geographically diverse, a disproportionate number are found in southwestern Ontario and southern Quebec. Amongst the 20 most susceptible CMAs and CAs, manufacturing employment, which has a high potential for automation, captures on average 18 percent of the total labour force, compared to nine

percent across Canada. Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction, also with a high potential for automation, represents on average four percent of the total labour force, compared to one percent across Canada. These highly susceptible CMAs and CAs also have a lower proportion of relatively insulated industries, such as professional, scienti c and technical services, public administration, as well as nance and insurance, compared to the Canadian average.

10

However, these highly susceptible CMAs and CAs vary greatly in terms of industrial diversity. CMAs and CAs such as Leamington, Ont., Brooks and Wood Bu alo, Alta., and Estevan, Sask., rank relatively high on the diversity index, meaning they are highly specialized. This lack of industrial diversity could inhibit their resilience to potential shocks as a result of automation. On

the other hand, CMAs and CAs such as Granby or Victoriaville, Que., have relatively diverse industrial mixes and may be be er positioned to weather the negative labour market implications posed by automation.

Canada is also home to a large number of cities and towns that are relatively resistant to the e ects of automation. The CMAs and CAs least susceptible to automation include many smaller cities and towns with a large healthcare presence, such as Corner Brook, N d., or Cambleton, N.B., where more than 20 percent of the total labour force is employed in healthcare and social assistance. They also include cities and towns with a large post-secondary presence, such as Kingston, Ont., where 15 percent of total employment is in educational services, as well as those with a high proportion of employment in public administration, such as O awa-Gatineau, Ont., where about one quarter of the labour force is employed in this sector. Canada's largest cities, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, were not amongst the 20 CMAs and CAs with the lowest susceptibility to automation. Each of these cities has above average employment in highly specialized industries, with a low potential for automation, such as professional, scienti c and technical services. However, they also have diverse economies with a large proportion of employment in industries that are more susceptible to automation, such as manufacturing. While di erent towns and cities will likely feel the impacts of automation di erently, even in the least susceptible towns and cities there is a sizable proportion of the labour force with the potential for automation. Across all CMAs and CAs, the proportion of work activities with the potential to be automated ranges from 43 percent in Petawawa, Ont., to over 50 percent in Ingersoll, Ont. The relatively limited variation in potential automation impacts across Canada's CMAs and CAs is the result of two factors. First, as technology becomes increasingly capable of performing complex tasks, it has the potential to impact workers across industries.28 CMAs and CAs may therefore feel the e ects of these trends regardless of their industrial composition. For example, even a town with a signi cant number of employees in health care, which is relatively resistant to the impacts of automation, is not immune. 37

percent of work activities in this industry still have the potential to be automated. This town may also have a large proportion of employment in industries more susceptible to automation, such as accommodation and food services. Second, the proportion of employment across industries in Canada's cities and towns is fairly consistent, with some exceptions. However, the potential for automation will not always be realized, as other factors (described in the section on data sources) will in uence employer decisions. In addition, a city's or town's resilience to the e ects of these trends may be enhanced by a more diverse industry mix.

T

hroughout history, technology has been a major driving force behind signi cant changes in our society --everything from how long we live, to what people do for work. The most recent wave of technological advancements, dubbed by the World Economic Forum as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, will continue to produce much more sophisticated technology at a much quicker pace. As a result, technology is projected to have wideranging impacts on the Canadian labour force. However, these impacts are likely to be felt di erently across the country. By mapping McKinsey automation data against labour force data for Canada's CMAs and CAs, this report suggests that, in the coming years, smaller cities and towns specializing in either manufacturing or resource extraction, particularly in the Canadian Prairies, southern Ontario and Quebec, will face the highest potential for job disruption as a result of automation. In contrast, the areas least susceptible to automation in Canada range from smaller towns and cities with a large hospital, government or post-secondary presence, to some larger cities with diversi ed economies and a highly skilled labour force.

12

Overall, automation holds huge promise, as well signi cant risks for individual Canadians and communities. While the rate and extent of adoption of di erent technologies across industries is unknown, the bene ts as well as the job displacement risks resulting from automation are likely to be more concentrated in certain industries, and in certain cities and towns. This suggests a need to more deeply understand the areas and people that are most at risk and to design policy and program responses--including in the areas of training, upskilling, education, and social safety nets--that take this uneven distribution of risk into account. +++++ In the coming months, BII+E will continue to examine the di erentiated impacts of automation on disparate regions and individuals across the country. Our goal is to interrogate and analyze the industrial, socioeconomic, and demographic characteristics associated with a higher susceptibility to automation. We aim to create a pro le of the regions and people that are most likely to be impacted by automation, recognizing the complex array of factors that will in uence the future of work. We will build on this initial data insights report to inform the Canadian discourse on what technology and innovation mean for inclusive economic growth in Canada. By mapping these trends and relationships at a more micro level, we will help to build a robust evidence base to inform the design of policies related to skills training, employment and social safety nets.

The ve CMAs and CAs in B.C. most susceptible to automation have particularly high employment in two highly susceptible industries: agriculture, forestry, shing and hunting, which represents on average 6 percent of total employment,ii as well as manufacturing, which represents on average 11 percent of total employment.iii Take for example Quesnel, a small city in the heart of the province. This city is amongst the most susceptible CMAs and CAs in B.C., largely driven by its predominant forestry iv and wood product manufacturing v industries. The CMAs and CAs most susceptible to automation in B.C. also have a larger proportion of total

employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction, at ve percent of total employment on average, compared to the national average of two percent. This includes Fort St. John, a city in northeastern B.C., which is the home of the provincial Oil and Gas Commission and where 14 percent of total employment is in the oil and gas industry. Compared to the least susceptible CMAs and CAs in the province, these cities and towns are also more concentrated in terms of industry mix, most notably Williams Lake, B.C. This could limit their resilience to any potential labour market dislocations associated with automation.

Note: A location quotient above one indicates a higher concentration of work activities with the potential to be automated, compared to the Canadian average.

In the Canadian Prairies, the CMAs and CAs most susceptible to automation have workforces heavily concentrated in resource extraction. On average, amongst the most susceptible cities and towns, the proportion of total employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction exceeds the Canadian average by 16 percentage points. For example, the Regional Municipality of Wood Bu alo, Alta., which is home to Fort McMurray and the Athabasca Oil Sands, has 30 percent of total employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction, compared to one percent of total employment across Canada. Brooks, a city in southeast Alberta, has the highest concentration of high susceptibility industries in

the Canadian Prairies. This is driven primarily by the high proportion of employment in energy (oil and gas) and manufacturing (metals). The Prairie Provinces are also home to other highly susceptible industries, including agriculture, forestry, shing and hunting, construction and utilities. Compared to other regions, the CMAs and CAs most susceptible to automation in the Canadian Prairies rank the highest on the diversity index-- indicating highly specialized local economies. This suggests that these cities and towns may be more vulnerable than the rest of the country to the potential negative impacts of automation.

The cities and towns least susceptible to automation in the Canadian Prairies have on average much higher proportions of employment in public administration--13 percent of the local labour force compared to the seven percent national average--as well as health care and social assistance and educational services. For example, the city of Cold Lake, Alta., has close ties to the Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Cold Lake. As a result, 27 percent of total employment is in public administration, compared to the national average of seven percent. Another example is North Ba leford, Sask. This small city falls within

the province's Prairie North Health Region and is home to two large hospitals, believed to be the region's largest employers. As a result, 20 percent of total employment in North Ba leford is in the healthcare industry, compared to the national average of 11 percent. However, many of these CMAs and CAs, such as Cold Lake, Alta., are still home to large extractive industries at 17 percent of the total labour force, which have a higher potential to be impacted by automation.

Note: A location quotient above one indicates a higher concentration of work activities with the potential to be automated, compared to the Canadian average.

The CMAs and CAs in Ontario most susceptible to automation are primarily small manufacturing cities and towns in the southwest--a region once considered Canada's industrial heartland. However, due to a number of factors including the rising dollar, manufacturing employment in this region has already experienced signi cant decline over the past decade or so.29 Employment may continue to decline in the area if existing manufacturers continue to invest in labour saving technologies to improve productivity and maintain cost competitiveness.

Among the most susceptible CMAs and CAs, manufacturing employment represents 21 percent of the total labour force on average, compared to the national average of nine percent. This includes Ingersoll, Woodstock and Tillsonburg, Ont., whose proportion of total employment in manufacturing exceeds 20 percent.

22

The most susceptible cities and towns also have higher proportions of employment in agriculture, forestry, shing and hunting,x accommodation and food services,xi and transportation and warehousing.xii When considering overall industrial diversity, on average these highly susceptible CMAs and CAs in
Figure 18:

Ontario do not di er drastically from the national average. The major exception is Leamington, Ont., whose diversity index score of 11.0 indicates a notably greater industry uniformity compared to the national average. This could indicate that Leamington, Ont., may be less resilient to the potential impacts of automation compared to the other highly susceptible CMAs and CAs in Ontario.

The cities least susceptible to automation in Ontario include O awa-Gatineau, Ont., home of Canada's federal public service, where about one-quarter of total employment is in public administration. It also includes smaller cities with a high proportion of emplopyment in health care and educational services such as Kingston, Ont., home of Queen's University and a number of large hospitals. Toronto, the country's largest city, ranks 9th lowest in Canada when it comes to the concentration

of work with the potential to be automated. As a large, economically diverse city, Toronto has a signi cant proportion of employment in industries with both a low and high susceptibility to automation. For example, professional, scienti c and technical services make up 10 percent of Toronto's total employment, compared to the national average of seven percent. However, Toronto is also home to many highly susceptible industries such as manufactung, which makes up 10 percent of the city's total employment.

Similar to Ontario, small manufacturing towns and cities in southern Quebec have the highest potential for automation. Amongst the most susceptible CMAs and CAs, the proportion of total employment in manufacturing averaged 22 percent. These CMAs and CAs also have above average employment, as a proportion of total, in retail trade, accommodation and food services, as well as agriculture, forestry, shing and hunting. For

example, employment in the town of Cowansville, Que., is particularly concentrated in manufacturing and retail trade. However, these CMAs and CAs also have relatively diverse industry mixes. This could help insulate their economies from some of the negative repercussions associated with automation.

The CMAs and CAs with the least potential for automation in Quebec range from cities with diversi ed economies and a highly skilled labour force, such as Montreal, where 9 percent of total employment is in professional, scienti c and technical services, to Quebec City, the provincial capital, where nearly 14 percent of total employment is in public administration in 2011. They also include smaller towns and cities such as Rimouski, which is home to the Université du Québec à Rimouski and the Conservatory of

Music. As a result, this city has a high proportion of total employment in educational services as well as information and cultural industries, which are some of the least susceptible industries to automation. These relatively insulated CMAs and CAs in Quebec also have comparatively diverse economies, in particular the larger metropolitan areas of Montréal and Québec.

Note: A location quotient above 1 indicates a higher concentration of work activities with the potential to be automated versus the Canadian average.

The CMAs and CAs most susceptible to automation in the Maritimes have, on average, much higher employment in retail trade, as well as manufacturing; agriculture, forestry, shing and hunting; and accommodation and food services. However, unlike in other parts of Canada, the most susceptible Maritime cities and towns have fairly diverse economies and are home to large industries relatively insulated from automation. On average, 14 percent of total employment in these CMAs and CAs is in health care and social assistance, compared to 11 percent across Canada,

and nine percent of total employment is in public administration, compared to seven percent across Canada. Take for example, New Glasgow, N.S., a town with a population of nearly 30,000. This town has a fairly diverse economy, with major employers in the area including a Michelin tire plant, the Northern Pulp Nova Scotia pulp mill, the Aberdeen Hospital, as well as the headquarters of the national grocery chain Sobeys.

The least susceptible CMAs and CAs in the Maritimes have a high proportion of total employment in public administration, health care and social assistance, as well as educational services. For example, Corner Brook, a small city in Newfoundland, is home to the largest regional hospital in the west of the province, as well as the Grenfell Campus of Memorial University. As a result, over 30 percent of total employment in the city is either in health care, social assistance or educational services, making this city comparatively resistant to automation.

Many of the major cities in the region, including Halifax, N.S., and St. John's, N d., also have relatively low concentrations of work activities with the potential for automation. These cities have higher than average employment in public administration, educational services, and health care and social assistance. They are also home to a relatively diverse industry mix, providing a further bu er against negative automation impacts.
