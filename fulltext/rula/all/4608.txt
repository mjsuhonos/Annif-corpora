Health  Perceptions  and  Experiences  of  Cantonese-speaking  Older  Immigrant  Women  from   Mainland  China  Living  in  Toronto      Alicia  W.  Fong   Master  of  Arts  2015   Immigration  and  Settlement  Studies   Ryerson  University      ABSTRACT  

Few  health  studies  have  been  conducted  in  a  non-official  language  with  participants.  In   addition,  few  studies  have  attempted  to  discover  the  social  determinants  of  health  to  account   for  health  inequalities  for  immigrant  women  through  qualitative  interviews  (Hyman,  2007).  This   study  endeavoured  to  understand  the  perceptions  of  health  and  the  experiences  of  healthcare   services  in  Toronto  by  Cantonese-speaking  older  immigrant  women.  The  study  was  conducted   in  their  own  language.  In  addition  to  the  Cantonese-speaking  older  immigrant  women,   community  workers  who  work  with  Chinese  immigrant  clients  were  also  interviewed.  The  social   determinants  of  health  were  divided  into  post-migration  challenges  and  systemic  barriers,  then   analyzed  with  an  intersectional  theoretical  framework.  This  study  highlights  the  importance  of   an  intersectional  approach  since  many  social  determinants  influenced  the  participants'  health   experiences.  Furthermore,  this  study  underlines  the  need  to  advocate  for  immigrant  health  to   take  prominence  in  national  health  policy  in  Canada.      Key  words:  Chinese,  immigrant  women,  health,  older  adults,  language

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
Healthcare  is  an  essential  service  for  every  human  being.  Canada  signed  the  United   Nations'  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  Article  25  (1948),  which  declared  that   everyone  has  the  right  to  good  health  and  well-being  for  themselves  and  their  family,  including   access  to  medical  care.  Institutional  factors  (i.e.,  health  care  system,  medical  professionals)  or   post-migration  challenges  (i.e.,  immigration  status,  language)  are  barriers  to  Canadian   healthcare  that  exist  for  immigrants  (Asanin  &  Wilson,  2008;  Fang,  2010;  Hyman,  2009;  Liang  et   al.,  2004;  Oxman-Martinez  et  al.,  2005;  Sanmartin  &  Ross,  2006;  Wood  &  Newbold,  2012).   Immigrants  may  have  difficulty  in  accessing  healthcare  due  to  their  inability  to  speak  adequate   English  or  French,  especially  for  older  adult  immigrants  (Chinese  Advisory  Council  [CAC],  2008;   Guruge  et  al.,  2009;  Liang  et  al.,  2004).  Furthermore,  women  are  often  migrating  as  dependents   or  sponsored  spouses,  which  can  limit  their  ability  to  seek  healthcare  because  of  perceived   burdens  to  their  sponsor  (Caulford  &  D'Andrade,  2012).  Yet  the  heterogeneity  of  immigrant   women  requires  examining  their  health  in  a  way  that  accounts  for  possible  differences.  The   social  determinants  of  health  can  be  a  way  to  account  for  this  heterogeneity  among  immigrant   women  (Atlantic  Centre  of  Excellence  for  Women's  Health  [ACEWH],  1998;  Guruge  et  al.,  2009).   Interrelationships  between  many  factors  (i.e.,  ethnicity,  age,  sex,  geographic  location,   immigrant  status,  socioeconomic  status,  housing  status)  may  influence  health  as  social   determinants  (ACEWH,  1998;  Newbold,  2005).  While  studies  were  completed  about  immigrant   health  (ACEWH,  1998;  Lou  &  Beaujot,  2005;  Sanmartin  &  Ross,  2006;  Vissandjee  et  al.,  2001;   Wood  &  Newbold,  2012),  health  outcomes  for  specific  ethnic  groups,  older  adults  or  women      1  

are  fewer  (ACEWH,  1998;  Hyman,  2007;  McMaster  Research  Centre  for  the  Promotion  of   Women's  Health,  1999;  Wang  &  Hu,  2013).  The  reasons  for  studying  older  immigrants,  older   Chinese  persons,  and  Chinese  immigrant  women  are  outlined  below.   Older  immigrants  have  different  characteristics  than  the  general  Canadian  population.     Older  immigrants  are  more  likely  to  reside  in  Toronto  or  Vancouver  than  non-immigrants:  in   2001,  30.4%  of  older  immigrants  lived  in  Toronto  compared  to  only  7.4%  of  Canadian-born   older  adults  (Statistics  Canada,  2007).  The  total  population  of  women  aged  65  and  over  in  2006   was  14%  compared  to  20%  of  the  immigrant  women  population  (Milan  &  Vezina,  2010).  Older   immigrant  women  were  more  likely  than  the  non-immigrant  population  to  live  with  relatives  at   almost  13%  (5%  of  non-immigrants),  as  well  as  older  immigrant  men  at  3.4%  (2.3%  of  non- immigrants;  Milan  &  Vezina,  2010).   Older  immigrants,  such  as  older  Chinese  adults  could  benefit  from  further  study  since  a   large  proportion  of  older  Chinese  adults  are  immigrants  (CAC,  2008;  Lam,  1994).  In  a  Chinese   community  report  in  a  Greater  Toronto  region,  two  of  the  top  five  needs  and  challenges  for  the   community  were  language  barriers  and  supports  for  older  adults  (CAC,  2008).  Older  Chinese   adults  also  faced  barriers  of  transportation,  cultural  differences  and  isolation  (CAC,  2008;  Lam,   1994).  It  is  noted  that  in  one  study  that  asked  older  Chinese  immigrants  about  the  barriers  they   faced  in  healthcare  access,  health  system  factors  (administrative  or  professionals)  accounted   for  about  33%  of  the  variance  compared  to  sociodemographic  or  personal  factors,  which   accounted  for  about  29%  of  the  variance  (Lai  &  Chau,  2007).   Past  research  showed  that  compared  to  immigrant  men,  immigrant  women  have  poorer   outcomes  in  physical  health  and  mental  health  studies,  which  is  a  concern  for  Canadian  society  

   2  

(Kim  et  al.,  2013;  Wang  &  Hu,  2013).  This  outcome  has  been  found  with  studies  involving   Chinese  immigrant  women  in  Canada  (Kim  et  al.,  2013;  Lai,  2004;  Lai  &  Chau,  2007;  Wang  &  Hu,   2013).  In  a  study  that  did  not  separate  Chinese  immigrants  from  Canadian-born  Chinese,  older   Chinese  Canadian  women  were  found  to  be  less  healthy  than  their  male  counterparts  (Lai,   2004).  In  another  study,  Chinese  immigrant  women  were  over  three  times  more  likely  to  report   an  unhealthy  status  than  Chinese  males  in  a  comparison  with  overall  foreign-born,  South  Asian,   and  Portuguese  immigrant  groups  (Wang  &  Hu,  2013).  Another  study  found  that  Chinese   immigrant  women  are  among  other  groups  of  immigrant  women  that  are  more  at  risk  for  poor   health  (Kim  et  al.,  2013).  Older  Chinese  immigrant  women  were  also  found  to  be  more   vulnerable  to  experiencing  service  barriers  in  healthcare  (Lai  &  Chau,  2007).  However,  these   studies  were  unable  to  pinpoint  demographic  or  social  factors  that  may  influence  reports  of   poor  health  for  Chinese  immigrant  women.  As  such,  a  study  is  needed  to  examine  the  social   context  that  contributes  to  the  health  experiences  of  older  Chinese  immigrant  women.  

1.2 Research  Purpose  
Although  other  studies  have  found  social  factors  that  are  important  to  other  immigrant   women's  health,  it  is  unknown  to  what  extent  these  factors  are  important  for  Chinese   immigrant  women  (Kushniryk,  Titus-Roberts  &  Wertz,  2014;  Lou  &  Beaujot,  2005;  Meadows,   Thurston  &  Melton,  2001).  Older  Chinese  immigrant  women  face  potential  health  challenges  in   addition  to  aging  (Chundamala,  Matsuo  &  Peng,  2006;  Liang  et  al.,  2004;  Todd  &  Hoffman- Goetz,  2011).  Cultural  issues  surrounding  health  may  impact  older  Chinese  immigrant  women's   health  practices  (Liang  et  al.,  2004;  Todd  &  Hoffman-Goetz,  2011).  Although  Western  medicine   separates  physical  health  and  mental  health,  the  body  and  mind  are  viewed  holistically  in  

   3  

Chinese  medicine  (Chen,  Kazanjian  &  Wong,  2009;  Fang,  2010).  Due  to  stigma  about  mental   health  problems  in  Chinese  culture,  subsequently  mental  health  issues  may  be  presented  as   physical  health  issues  (Chen,  Kazanjian  &  Wong,  2009;  Fang,  2010;  Saechao  et  al.,  2012).     Therefore,  it  is  important  to  probe  beyond  the  physical  health  symptoms  for  Chinese  immigrant   women  to  understand  the  social  context  that  may  affect  their  health.     Chinese  older  adults  may  have  difficulty  acquiring  a  new  language  late  in  their  life.  Their   lack  of  official  language  skills,  together  with  increased  health  problems  that  can  be  linked  to   aging  leaves  older  immigrants  at  risk  of  not  obtaining  adequate  healthcare.  A  research  gap   exists  when  researchers  fail  to  use  immigrants'  primary  language  to  ask  about  their  experiences   with  physical  health  or  mental  health  services  if  immigrants  lack  official  language  skills  (ACEWH,   1998;  Kushniryk,  Titus-Roberts  &  Wertz,  2014).  Older  Chinese  immigrant  women,  in  particular,   may  not  have  had  the  opportunity  to  learn  another  language,  or  in  some  cases  obtain  an   education  (Anderson,  Blue  &  Lau,  1991).   The  evidence  about  older  Chinese  immigrant  women's  health,  so  far,  points  to  a  need   for  further  research  into  the  effects  of  social  determinants  on  their  health  (Chundamala,   Matsuo  &  Peng,  2006;  Hyman,  2007;  Kim  et  al.,  2013;  Lai,  2004;  Lai  &  Chau,  2007;  Wang  &  Hu,   2013).  To  address  language  barriers  and  to  understand  the  social  context  of  older  Chinese   immigrant  women,  this  project  aimed  for  a  better  understanding  of  their  experiences  with   health  and  the  healthcare  system  through  semi-structured  qualitative  interviews  that  were   conducted  in  Cantonese  with  older  Chinese  immigrant  women.  In  addition,  service  providers   that  work  directly  with  the  population  of  interest  were  interviewed  about  issues  that  their   clients  encountered.  This  paper  will  elucidate  the  varied  health  experiences  of  Chinese  

   4  

immigrant  women  and  expand  research  knowledge  about  the  social  context  of  a  less   extensively  studied  group,  older  Chinese  immigrant  women.  

1.3 Literature  Review  
1.3.1 Historical  Context  of  Chinese  Women  in  Canada   Cantonese-speaking  women  have  a  longer  history  with  Canada  since  their  husbands  or   sons  from  southern  China  worked  on  the  railways  or  mines  in  Canada  from  the  late  1800s.   However,  Chinese  women  could  not  migrate  until  after  the  1947  Chinese  Exclusion  Act,  which   was  enacted  by  the  federal  government,  was  repealed.  Therefore  it  was  not  until  the  1960s   when  family  reunification  was  allowed  that  more  substantial  numbers  of  Chinese  women   arrived  in  Canada  (Das  Gupta,  2000).  The  balance  of  Chinese  immigrant  women  to  men  was   achieved  with  approximately  52%  Chinese  female  immigrants  between  1980-2000  (Wang  &  Lo,   2005).  The  majority  of  Cantonese-speaking  immigrants  arrived  before  1997  when  Hong  Kong   was  returned  to  China,  while  more  recent  Chinese  immigrants  are  Mandarin-speaking  (Wang  &   Lo,  2005).     However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  recent  Chinese  immigrants  in  Canada  have  a  more   diversified  geographic  and  linguistic  background  than  previous  waves,  including  ethnic  Chinese   from  Taiwan,  Southeast  Asia,  and  South  America  (Wan,  2004).  Educational  and  economic   backgrounds  are  also  diversified,  so  while  recent  Chinese  immigrants  share  the  same  ethnicity,   their  sociodemographic  profiles  vary.  Yet  recently  immigrated,  older  Chinese  women  share  an   immigration  status  that  is  similar  to  other  Chinese  immigrant  women  in  that  they  are  likely   sponsored  or  dependents  (Poy,  2013;  Preston  &  Man,  1999).  This  dependency  on  their  sponsor   can  affect  their  access  to  healthcare  (Oxman-Martinez  et  al.,  2005;  Wang,  1997).

1.3.2 Toronto's  Chinese  Community   Toronto  is  one  of  the  most  culturally  diverse  cities  in  the  world,  with  over  200  distinct   ethnic  origins  identified  in  the  2006  census  (City  of  Toronto,  2015).    Almost  half  of  Toronto's   population  was  born  outside  of  Canada  at  approximately  1.2  million  out  of  2.8  million  (City  of   Toronto,  2015).    The  Chinese  are  among  the  top  five  racialized  groups  in  Toronto  at  11.4%  or   approximately  283,000  people  in  2006  (City  of  Toronto,  2015).  Toronto  is  home  to  the  largest   population  of  Chinese  in  Canada  by  metropolitan  area  (approx.  537,000),  however  it  is  second   to  Vancouver  in  terms  of  proportion  of  the  population  (9.6%  compared  to  18%;  Statistics   Canada,  2006).  Approximately  420,000  people  in  2006  spoke  Chinese  as  a  mother  tongue   language  in  Toronto,  consisting  of  two-thirds  identifying  Cantonese  and  one-third  identifying   Mandarin  (City  of  Toronto,  2015).     Many  Chinese  immigrants  choose  to  immigrate  to  Toronto  for  employment   opportunities  or  for  its  large  established  Chinese  ethnic  community  (Wan,  2004).  This  echoes   results  from  a  study  of  Hong  Kong  immigrants  to  Toronto  (Preston,  Kobayashi  &  Siemiatycki,   2006):  37%  immigrated  as  skilled  workers  and  approximately  one-third  immigrated  through   family  sponsorship.  Two-thirds  of  participants  stated  the  presence  of  other  family  members  as   the  main  reason  for  migrating  (Preston,  Kobayashi  &  Siemiatycki,  2006).     1.3.3 Social  Determinants  of  Health     A  number  of  social  factors  were  identified  that  could  influence  Chinese  women's  health,   immigrant  health,  or  women's  health.  Factors  found  to  be  relevant  for  Chinese  people  or   Chinese  women  will  be  described  first,  followed  by  factors  found  to  be  important  for  other   immigrant  women.  In  one  study  among  older  Chinese  adults,  sociodemographic  variables  such  

   6  

as  being  female,  being  single,  being  an  immigrant  from  Hong  Kong,  having  a  lower  income,  and   living  in  Canada  for  less  time  were  predictors  of  more  health  service  barriers  (Lai  &  Chau,  2007).     In  another  study,  age  and  income  were  significant  risk  factors  for  reporting  poor  health,   especially  for  low-income,  elderly,  married  females  (Wang  &  Hu,  2013).  Married  or  common- law  Chinese  immigrants  were  more  likely  than  single  immigrants  to  report  poor  health,  which   meant  that  married  Chinese  female  immigrants  were  more  vulnerable  for  health  deterioration   (Wang  &  Hu,  2013).     Chinese  health  beliefs  could  influence  the  use  of  the  Canadian  medical  system  for   Chinese  immigrant  women.  Chinese  people  usually  perceive  mental  illnesses  as  "organic   disorders,"  which  can  explain  the  expression  of  psychological  problems  in  a  psychosomatic   form  (Fang,  2010,  p.  71).  As  such,  Chinese  patients  are  more  likely  to  consult  their  family   doctors  rather  than  seeking  help  from  mental  health  professionals.  This  may  also  explain  why   patients  who  have  a  doctor  that  speaks  their  language  are  less  likely  to  use  mental  health   services  (Chen,  2010).  Yet,  even  doctors  who  speak  the  same  language  and  share  the  same   culture  often  fail  to  recognize  and  treat  their  patients'  mental  health  issues  (Fang,  2010).  In   addition,  Chinese  patients  may  use  traditional  Chinese  medical  practitioners  for  relief  from   emotional  difficulties  (i.e.,  herbalists,  acupuncturists;  Fang,  2010;  Lam,  1994).  Moreover,  the   concept  of  mental  health  for  immigrant  women  can  be  heterogeneous  and  may  not  conform  to   Western  mental  health  beliefs  (Wong  &  Tsang,  2004).    Different  health  beliefs  also  impacted   the  dietary  behaviours  of  Chinese  immigrants  to  Canada  (Kwok  et  al.,  2009),  and  their  use  of   prescription  drugs  (Morgan  et  al.,  2011).    These  cultural  aspects  can  influence  the  health   behaviours  of  Chinese  immigrant  women  in  Canada.

  Social  class  was  noted  as  a  factor  that  can  affect  Chinese  women's  mental  health  in  

Canada,  however  in  Tang,  Oatley  and  Toner's  (2007)  study,  they  did  not  compare  different   social  classes  of  Chinese  women.  The  role  of  social  class  in  health  has  not  been  extensively   studied  for  Chinese  immigrant  women  so  far,  although  studies  have  noted  differences  in  health   maintenance  and  in  health  promotion  (Calnan,  1986),  and  self-reported  health  status  (Borrell  et   al.,  2004)  between  different  social  classes  of  women.  One  study  (Anderson,  Blue  &  Lau,  1991)   did  note  that  the  impact  of  social  class  might  influence  a  doctor-patient  relationship.  A  Chinese   immigrant  woman  consulted  a  doctor  that  spoke  the  same  language  and  came  from  the  same   culture,  yet  she  felt  that  there  was  a  lack  of  understanding  from  the  doctor  for  her  working- class  situation  in  managing  diabetes.  As  such,  the  role  of  social  class  as  a  factor  needs  further   exploration  in  relation  to  Chinese  immigrant  women's  health.   Family  members  could  influence  the  decisions  surrounding  women's  health  (Fang,  2010;   Kushniryk,  Titus-Roberts  &  Wertz,  2014).  Women  did  not  wish  to  disrupt  relations  with  the   person  who  sponsored  them,  who  was  responsible  for  their  health  costs,  as  such  they  refused   to  seek  medical  treatment  unless  absolutely  necessary  (ACEWH,  1998;  Wang,  1997).    Chinese   immigrant  women  who  depended  on  their  husband  or  friends  to  translate  during  visits  to  the   doctor  felt  demoralized  and  embarrassed  over  this  dependence  (Wang,  1997).  However,  they   also  felt  that  doctors  contributed  to  these  feelings  by  ignoring  them  during  the  appointment   and  focusing  on  the  translator  (Wang,  1997).  Consequently,  dependence  or  family  may   influence  Chinese  immigrant  women's  health  behaviours.        More  broadly,  spirituality  and  religion  could  affect  immigrant  women's  health.  For  some  

immigrant  women,  it  was  a  vital  health  maintenance  practice  that  provided  nurturing  and  

   8  

relaxation  (Meadows,  Thurston  &  Melton,  2001).  The  authors  noted  that  it  was  through  asking   immigrant  women  about  everyday  practices  in  their  life  rather  than  specific  mental,  spiritual,   and  social  factors  that  these  discussions  occurred  (Meadows,  Thurston  &  Melton,  2001).   Discussions  about  stress,  emotional  trauma,  and  abuse  were  situated  in  discussions  of  family   history,  the  experience  of  immigration,  everyday  practices,  and  the  use  of  health  resources   (Meadows,  Thurston  &  Melton,  2001).  As  a  result,  spirituality  and  religion  is  a  factor  that  may   influence  the  health  of  immigrant  women.   Social  support  and  a  sense  of  belonging  could  influence  immigrant  health.  It  was   theorized  by  Lou  and  Beaujot  (2005)  that  if  immigrants  received  as  much  social  support  (i.e.,   coping  resources)  as  the  Canadian  population,  their  healthy  immigrant  advantage  would  be   more  evident.  The  Canadian-born  population  received  more  social  support  in  general  than   recent  or  long-term  immigrants  in  the  Canadian  Community  Health  Survey.  Social  support  was   significantly  associated  with  self-rated  mental  health.  Long-term  immigrants  and  immigrant   women  were  more  likely  to  suffer  from  poor  mental  health,  but  were  less  likely  to  use  mental   health  resources  than  Canadians.  Immigrant  women  were  more  at  risk  of  poor  integration  into   Canadian  society  since  they  had  fewer  opportunities  to  learn  languages  and  skills,  or  to  be   employed  (Lou  &  Beaujot,  2005).  These  findings  show  that  social  support  and  a  sense  of   belonging  should  be  considered  as  a  factor  that  may  influence  the  health  for  Chinese  immigrant   women.        Neighbourhood  context  could  be  another  factor  that  affects  Chinese  immigrants'  health.  

Immigrants  that  ranked  their  health  as  poor  or  fair  were  more  likely  to  live  in  areas  of  ethnic   concentration,  however  this  was  not  significant  for  the  four  immigrant  groups  featured  in  one  

   9  

study,  which  included  the  Chinese  (Wang  &  Hu,  2013).  In  the  same  study,  respondents  were   more  likely  to  rank  their  health  as  poor  or  fair  if  they  experienced  neighbourhood  material   deprivation  (i.e.,  lack  of  access  to  transportation,  limited  proximity  of  grocery  stores  and   community  resources),  however  it  may  not  apply  to  all  immigrants  (Wang  &  Hu,  2013).  The   neighbourhood  context  may  also  differ  in  Toronto  compared  to  other  regions  with  smaller   Chinese  populations  in  Canada.   Therefore,  there  is  evidence  that  social  context  factors  such  as  sociodemographic   characteristics  (Lai  &  Chau,  2007;  Wang  &  Hu,  2013),  cultural  health  beliefs  (Chen,  2010;  Fang,   2010;  Lam,  1994;  Lu  et  al.,  2008),  doctor-patient  relationships  or  social  class  (Anderson,  Blue  &   Lau,  1991),  and  familial  influence  (ACEWH,  1998;  Kushniryk,  Titus-Roberts  &  Wertz,  2014;   Wang,  1997)  can  affect  Chinese  immigrant  women's  health  status  and  health  behaviours.     There  may  be  relationships  between  neighbourhood  context,  social  support,  sense  of   belonging,  and  spirituality  to  influence  the  health  of  Chinese  immigrant  women,  which  was   found  with  other  immigrant  women  or  immigrant  populations.  These  factors  will  be  explored   through  responses  to  interview  questions  in  subsequent  sections  of  this  paper.  Through   interviewing  Cantonese-speaking  older  immigrant  women,  relevant  social  factors  that  influence   their  health  and  healthcare  experiences  will  be  identified.  

1.4 Theoretical  Framework  
1.4.1 Intersectionality  Theory   Intersectionality  was  a  term  that  began  with  American  critical  race  scholar  Kimberlé   Williams  Crenshaw  (1989).  Intersectional  analyses  in  the  health  context  examine  intersections   of  gender,  ethnicity,  social  class  and  other  areas  of  difference  (Collins  &  Guruge,  2008).  Humans  

   10  

cannot  be  reduced  to  single  social  categories,  nor  are  they  a  sum  of  additive  independent   effects  (Hankivsky,  2014).  Gender  is  experienced  differently  according  to  the  social  context,  and   depends  on  historical,  socioeconomic,  and  cultural  experiences  (Crenshaw,  1991;  Ng,  1988).   Some  feminist  and  antiracist  discourses  failed  to  account  for  intersectional  identities  that   racialized  women  represent,  thereby  marginalizing  racialized  women  within  both  perspectives   (Crenshaw,  1991).  Ng  (1988)  noted  that  treating  immigrant  women  as  one  homogenous  group   ignores  differences  of  education,  class,  and  social  position  in  society. The  goal  of   intersectionality  is  to  highlight  that  groups  such  as  Chinese  immigrant  women  should  not  be   treated  as  one  homogeneous  group  (Hankivsky  et  al.,  2010).  Intersectionality  aims  to  explore   differences  among  groups  and  find  the  effects  of  interacting  social  factors  (Hankivsky  et  al.,   2010).        Social  determinants  of  health  are  social  and  economic  conditions  that  impact  the  health  

of  individuals,  families,  and  communities  (Collins  &  Guruge,  2008).  Immigration  status,  along   with  other  social  determinants  including  social  isolation,  language  barriers,  separation  from   family,  change  in  family  roles  and  norms,  and  unemployment  are  significant  factors  that  can   negatively  influence  the  health  of  immigrants  and  refugees  (Fowler,  1998).  Moreover,  some   immigrant  women  are  disadvantaged  by  age,  poverty,  and  discrimination  (Preston  et  al.,  2013).   Increased  international  efforts  to  understand  health  holistically  recognizes  that  social,  cultural,   economic,  and  physical  circumstances  can  be  even  more  important  than  personal  health   behaviours  to  affect  an  individual's  health  (Raphael,  2009).        However  to  focus  on  the  systemic  barriers  influencing  immigrant  women,  the  larger  

social  structures  behind  social  determinants  of  health  need  to  be  considered.  For  example,  

   11  

unemployment,  stress  and  unsafe  work  conditions,  and  barriers  to  affordable  care  are   associated  with  poorer  health  (Public  Health  Agency  of  Canada,  2011).  The  process  behind   unemployment  for  immigrant  women  involves  barriers  by  employers  and  professional   associations.  They  discount  foreign  education  from  certain  countries  (Teelucksingh  &  Galabuzi,   2005),  or  create  a  double  disadvantage  of  not  recognizing  foreign  credentials  or  work   experience,  and  insistence  of  Canadian  work  experience  (Dlamini,  Anucha  &  Wolfe,  2012).   These  barriers  that  are  in  place  by  employers  are  a  form  of  discrimination  that  leads  to   unemployment  for  immigrant  women.  These  barriers  have  been  linked  to  anti-racist   frameworks  since  it  perpetuates  societal  ideology  and  constructs  boundaries  that  if  it  is  not   Canadian  or  Western,  it  is  considered  inferior  (Collins  &  Guruge,  2008;  Satzewich  &  Liodakis,   2010).  Therefore,  while  social  determinants  of  health  identify  factors  that  influence  immigrant   women's  health,  there  is  also  a  need  to  examine  the  structural  barriers  behind  those  factors,   and  requires  a  larger,  encompassing  framework  such  as  intersectionality  to  examine  social   justice  issues.      There  is  not  a  single  way  to  perform  intersectional  analysis  of  research  data,  however  

social  and  historical  context  must  continue  to  inform  the  analysis  (Hunting,  2014).   Intersectional  analyses  focuses  on  the  interactions  of  different  social  locations,  systems  and   processes;  investigates  rather  than  assumes  the  significance  of  any  specific  combination  of   factors  (Hankivsky,  2014).  Due  to  limited  space  in  this  MRP,  an  exhaustive  intersectional   approach  will  not  be  used  since  the  numerous  themes  in  the  interviews  are  also  important.  I   have  concentrated  on  intersections  that  are  the  most  salient  in  the  intersectional  analyses.   The  health  experiences  of  older  Chinese  immigrant  women  are  varied  and  cannot  be  

   12  

defined  as  a  group  due  to  different  social  contexts.  The  responses  revealed  that  the  social   context  is  more  salient  among  factors  that  overlap  and  that  there  is  heterogeneity  in  the   women  interviewed,  which  makes  this  theoretical  approach  relevant.

The  purpose  of  the  study  is  to  understand  Cantonese-speaking  older  immigrant   women's  perceptions  of  health,  their  social  context,  and  their  experiences  with  health  and  the   healthcare  system  since  immigrating  to  Toronto.  The  main  research  question  is:  How  do   Cantonese-speaking  older  immigrant  women  perceive  and  experience  health  and  healthcare   services  in  Toronto?  A  sub-research  question:  How  does  social  context  influence  their  health   experience?     I  will  be  using  a  qualitative,  interpretive  method  to  answer  these  research  questions   since  the  aim  of  the  interpretive  method  is  to  understand  and  describe  meaning  that  is  socially   constructed  by  group  members  (Neuman,  2006).  This  method  is  related  to  the  intersectional   theory  since  it  allows  an  examination  of  the  many  possible  meanings  that  intersect  and  are   socially  constructed  by  Chinese  immigrant  women.  The  interpretive  method  also  explores   conditions  that  disadvantage  and  exclude  individuals  or  cultures  in  our  society,  which  is   relevant  for  Chinese  immigrant  women  (Creswell,  2007).   Since  this  research  design  involved  interactions  with  human  beings,  ethical  approval  was   obtained  under  the  merits  of  the  Tri-Council  Policy  Statement:  Ethical  Conduct  for  Research   Involving  Human  Beings  (TCPS)  by  the  Research  Ethics  Board  at  Ryerson  University.  The  primary   ethical  concerns  included  the  emotional  discomfort  that  some  might  feel  about  discussing  their      13  

personal  lives,  the  voluntary  nature  of  their  participation,  and  the  confidentiality  of  their   information.     As  a  researcher  using  the  intersectional  analytical  approach,  reflecting  on  the  social   location  between  the  participants  and  myself  is  a  necessary  process.  Although  I  do  have  the   power  of  the  written  word  and  fluency  in  English,  my  goal  is  to  use  my  power  to  add  my  voice   on  their  behalf  for  the  Chinese  community.  I  am  not  privileged  by  education  in  comparison  to   my  participants.  Both  of  the  Cantonese-speaking  women  have  university  degrees,  and  the   community  workers  also  have  at  least  post-secondary  degrees.  All  of  my  participants  were   women.  In  addition,  the  participants  and  I  were  all  ethnically  Chinese,  which  allows  us  to  have   the  same  ethnic  group  identification.  In  sharing  the  same  ethnic  group,  I  must  follow  Chinese   etiquette  with  regards  to  age.  Since  I  am  younger  than  the  Cantonese-speaking  participants  of   my  study,  it  was  expected  that  I  would  be  respectful  and  address  them  as  "Mrs.  (last  name),"   regardless  of  their  first  name.  My  Cantonese  language  skills  were  not  at  an  advanced  level   compared  to  the  Cantonese-speaking  women,  so  they  had  a  language  advantage.  I  was   privileged  as  an  in-group  member  among  the  Cantonese-speaking  women  and  Chinese   community  workers  that  they  all  wished  to  contribute  to  my  research.  Nevertheless,  it  is   important  to  keep  in  mind  that  without  a  personal  relationship  to  the  Cantonese-speaking   participants,  they  will  not  talk  as  openly  about  certain  aspects  of  their  lives  since  that  is  usually   the  Chinese  social  norm.   Despite  the  fact  that  my  project  was  conducted  from  an  academic  institution,  this  did   not  privilege  me  when  attempting  to  access  Chinese  older  adults  through  community   organizations.  Many  community  organizations  in  Toronto  refused  to  allow  me  access  to  their  

   14  

vulnerable  older  adult  participants  for  the  recruitment  purposes  of  my  project.  I  wondered   about  the  relationships  between  academics  and  community  organizations  for  this  to  be  an   issue.  Have  other  academics  damaged  a  potential,  mutually  beneficial  partnership?  Or  are   community  organizations  simply  too  busy  to  accommodate  academic  requests?     I  acknowledge  that  the  challenge  of  structural  barriers  may  make  my  participants   uncomfortable  for  having  their  words  interpreted  in  this  critical  context.  However,  this  study   could  potentially  help  highlight  that  some  changes  are  needed  in  the  healthcare  system  for   Cantonese-speaking  older  immigrant  women,  and  for  the  Chinese  immigrant  community  in   general.    

2.2 Participants  and  Recruitment  
The  study  criteria  for  recruitment  outlined  that  potential  Cantonese-speaking   participants  must  be  women  aged  50  or  over,  have  limited  or  no  English  language  skills,  and   migrated  to  Canada  within  the  past  10  years.  The  reasons  for  this  criteria  were  because  women   with  no  or  limited  English  language  skills  may  be  placed  in  a  more  difficult  situation  when  they   try  to  access  healthcare,  and  will  likely  rely  on  someone  else  to  help  them.  The  age  criteria  was   chosen  after  surveying  studies  with  Chinese  immigrant  women  that  used  ages  50  and  over   (Liang  et  al.,  2004;  Todd  &  Hoffman-Goetz,  2011),  studies  that  included  a  wider  range  of  25-60   (Tang,  Oatley  &  Toner,  2007;  Wang,  1997)  and  studies  that  used  55  or  65  as  the  minimum  (Lam,   1994;  Lai  &  Chau,  2007).  Ages  50  and  over  would  allow  a  good  overlap  of  ages  in  the  current   study  compared  to  other  studies,  and  also  would  focus  on  women  who  may  have  more  health   issues.  Older  adult  programs  with  community  organizations  are  also  available  starting  at  age  55.   The  migration  criteria  was  chosen  since  this  is  used  by  Statistics  Canada's  Canadian  Community  

   15  

Health  Survey  to  separate  recent  immigrants  from  long-term  immigrants  in  their  survey  data   (Gee,  Kobayashi  &  Prus,  2004;  Wang  &  Hu,  2013).   The  women  were  recruited  from  Toronto-area  community  centres  and  immigrant   settlement  organizations  through  identifying  relevant  organizations  and  potential  contacts.   Flyers  were  posted  in  Traditional  Chinese  (written  form  of  Cantonese  language)  at  participating   community  centres  and  organizations.  However,  only  two  women  shared  their  experiences   through  this  recruitment  process.  Therefore,  the  study  was  expanded  to  include  Toronto-area   community  workers  that  interact  with  this  population  of  interest  on  a  regular  basis  to  gain  a   better  understanding  of  ongoing  needs  and  issues.     Community  workers  were  recruited  through  purposive  sampling  of  community   organizations  that  have  programs  that  serve  mainly  Chinese  clients  in  a  health-related  capacity.   Community  workers  were  identified  through  community  organization  websites  and  their   availability  during  the  research  period.  Three  community  workers  were  interviewed,  however   one  withdrew  their  participation  after  being  interviewed  since  her  manager  did  not  give   approval  before  the  study  deadline.  Two  community  workers  remained  in  the  analysis  phase.   All  participants  received  an  honorarium  of  $20  to  participate  in  this  study.  

2.3 Data  Collection  
   All  interviews  were  conducted  in  a  semi-structured  format  in-person  and  audio-

recorded.  The  interviews  were  conducted  over  an  eleven-week  time  span.  The  Cantonese- speaking  older  immigrant  women  were  interviewed  for  approximately  2  hours,  while  the   community  workers  were  interviewed  for  approximately  1  hour.  For  Cantonese-speaking  older   immigrant  women,  the  interview  questions  focused  on  demographics,  social  context,  and  

   16  

health  experiences.  A  few  example  questions  included:  What  was  your  experience  like   immigrating  to  Canada?  What  is  your  understanding  about  health?  How  has  your  health  been   since  immigrating  to  Canada?  Interviews  were  conducted  in  Cantonese  and  transcripts  were   translated  back  into  English.  Random  sections  of  the  translated  transcripts  were  checked  with  a   friend  who  is  bilingual  in  Cantonese  and  English.  The  consent  form  was  translated  into   Traditional  Chinese  for  the  understanding  of  the  Cantonese-speaking  women.  A  list  of  health,   counseling,  and  settlement  agencies  for  Chinese  immigrant  women  in  Toronto  was  also   provided  to  participants.   For  the  community  workers,  interview  questions  involved  the  problems  that  their  clients   face,  attitudes  towards  Traditional  Chinese  medicine  from  their  clients,  and  stigmas  that  can   impact  help-seeking  behaviours,  among  other  areas.  Example  interview  questions  included:   Why  did  their  organization  decide  to  help  Chinese  access  physical  health  or  mental  health   services?  Who  is  their  typical  client  (i.e.,  age,  gender,  socioeconomic  status,  family  status)?   What  is  the  most  common  problem  that  they  help  Chinese  older  adults  with?  Interviews  with   community  workers  were  conducted  in  English.  These  interviews  were  transcribed  verbatim.  

3. Data  Analysis  
The  data  analysis  of  the  interview  transcripts  was  based  upon  a  guide  for  content   analysis  of  qualitative  data  (Taylor-Powell  &  Renner,  2003).    An  emergent  strategy  can  be  used   to  identify  themes.  Transcripts  are  read  through  and  themes  or  issues  that  recur  in  the  data  are   identified,  which  become  coding  categories.  Categories  may  be  organized  into  larger,  main   categories  and  smaller,  subcategories.  While  some  data  fit  into  mutually  exclusive  categories,   some  sections  of  data  fit  into  two  or  more  categories.  Data  is  then  sorted  into  their  categories  

   17  

to  identify  patterns  and  to  bring  meaning  to  the  responses.    Interpretation  occurs  through   attaching  meaning  and  significance  to  the  analysis  (Taylor-Powell  &  Renner,  2003).   The  themes  uncovered  through  an  interpretive  perspective  will  be  thoroughly  discussed   in  this  chapter.  Participant  characteristics  will  first  be  described,  followed  by  participant   answers  to  the  main  research  question  and  themes  emerging  from  the  sub-research  question   will  be  explored.  The  intersectional  analyses  will  be  the  focus  of  the  Discussion  chapter.   It  should  be  noted  that  when  possible,  information  pertaining  to  specific  groups  was   used  (i.e.,  Chinese  immigrant  women),  however  this  was  not  always  possible  since  the   community  workers  do  not  only  work  with  Chinese  immigrant  women.  In  this  paper,  ethnicity   refers  to  ancestral  origins,  while  culture  refers  to  social  process  and  practices  that  can  be  linked   to  ethnicity  but  may  differ  due  to  other  social  categories  (Satzewich  &  Liodakis,  2010).  Western   medicine  refers  to  the  biomedical  model  (Lu  et  al.,  2008).  While  I  recognize  that  mental  health   might  be  an  application  of  a  Western  medical  term  upon  a  cultural  group  that  does  not  think  of   the  mind  and  body  as  separate,  for  the  clarity  of  this  paper  I  will  use  the  term.  Also,  efforts   were  made  to  specify  between  physical  and  mental  health,  however  when  the  general  term   health  is  used,  it  refers  to  both.    

3.1 Participant  Characteristics  
   The  two  Cantonese-speaking  older  immigrant  women  were  both  from  Guangzhou,  

China.  Participant  1001  is  71  years  old,  completed  a  university  degree  in  chemistry  and  worked   in  research.  She  is  married  with  2  middle-aged  adult  children,  has  permanent  residency  status   and  has  lived  in  Canada  for  7  years.  Participant  1002  is  69  years  old,  earned  a  university  degree   in  mechanical  engineering  and  worked  as  a  senior  engineer.  She  is  divorced,  has  2  middle-aged  

   18  

adult  children,  has  permanent  residency  status  and  has  lived  in  Canada  for  2  years.  Both   women  took  Language  Instruction  for  Newcomers  to  Canada  (LINC)  classes  to  improve  their   English.        The  two  community  workers  were  approximately  45  years  old  and  possessed  at  least  a  

post-secondary  degree.  Participant  1003  is  a  senior  mental  health  worker  with  16  years  of   experience  working  in  the  settlement  or  mental  health  area,  obtained  a  post-graduate  diploma   in  management  and  a  Bachelor's  degree  in  Social  Work.  Participant  1005  is  a  health  promoter   with  14  years  of  experience  working  in  the  health  area,  and  a  Master's  degree  in  Public  Health.   They  both  work  with  different  groups  of  Chinese  clients:  women,  older  adults,  young  mothers   and  have  experience  with  non-Chinese  clients.  

3.2 Perceptions  of  Health  
To  explore  the  participants'  perceptions  of  health,  three  questions  were  asked:  Who  is  a   healthy  person?  How  would  you  describe  a  healthy  person?  What  were  their  experiences  with   healthcare  services?  The  healthcare  services  were  not  limited  to  medical  doctors,  but  also   included  other  health  professionals  that  older  adults  might  need  such  as  dentists,  optometrists,   chiropractors  or  physiotherapists.     The  Cantonese-speaking  women  perceived  health  holistically,  and  as  important  to   function  in  everyday  life.  "Health  means  no  illness,  good  well-being  physically  and  emotionally.   Sleep  and  have  meals  at  a  regular  time.  Being  well-rested  is  needed  to  have  energy  to  pay   attention  for  English  class"  (Participant  1001).  "I  feel  that  mental,  heart,  emotional  health  and   wellness  being  is  very  important.  I  am  able  to  sleep,  able  to  walk,  to  work  on  my  own"   (Participant  1002).    

   19  

A  healthy  person  took  into  account  two  principles:  "First  is  to  exercise.  Second  is  not  to   indulge  in  drinking  and  eating.  Simple  is  the  best  policy"  (Participant  1001).  Ensuring  that  food   had  nutritional  value  and  doing  everyday  household  tasks  were  also  important  to  the   participants.   The  Cantonese-speaking  women's  experiences  with  various  medical  professionals   differed.  Both  preferred  to  find  doctors  in  Toronto  that  could  speak  Cantonese,  and  interacted   with  health  professionals  that  spoke  Cantonese.  They  both  experienced  instances  of  their   doctors  not  investigating  their  medical  problems  further.     We  do  have  one,  but  our  family  doctor  won't  take  care  of  this.  Family  doctors  have  so   many  patients  and  each  time  we  see  them,  it  only  takes  10  minutes  to  be  finished.  [.  .  .  ]   My  family  doctor  has  a  lot  of  patients,  he  doesn't  want  to  investigate  and  he  has  no  time   for  me.  [.  .  .  ]  I  went  twice  [to  the  hospital].  If  you  have  an  appointment,  it's  probably   faster.  But  if  you  go  on  your  own  to  the  emergency,  then  it  takes  long.  That  time  it  was  a   Sunday  and  the  family  doctor  was  not  there.  So  I  had  a  nose  bleed  and  didn't  know  what   was  wrong.  I  walked  there  to  the  hospital  to  get  it  checked  but  next  time,  I  would  not  go   (Participant  1001).   I  have  a  family  doctor  who  is  from  Hong  Kong,  speaks  English  and  Chinese,  he  is  young.   The  first  one  was  older  and  he  knew  Cantonese  and  English  and  he  seemed  fine.  But  I   don't  know,  he  didn't  want  to  investigate  for  me.  I  wanted  to  know  so  I  changed  to  a   new  one.  He  is  much  clearer.  These  were  not  in  the  hospital,  this  was  in  a  clinic   (Participant  1002).   Both  understood  the  need  for  medical  testing  every  year  and  felt  that  they  had  no  

   20  

problems  since  some  interpretation  services  were  available.  "Some  of  the  departments  speak   Chinese.  Some  departments  don't.  Most  of  the  time,  they  arrange  [for]  someone  who  speaks   Chinese  to  talk  to  me"  (Participant  1002).  Participant  1002  also  saw  a  physiotherapist  that  was   from  Hong  Kong  for  her  shoulder  and  knees.  She  found  the  experience  helpful  to  "correct  her   old  habits."   Pharmacists  were  appreciated  for  their  role  in  taking  the  time  to  explain  the  drugs  to   them.     There  are  some  pharmacies  that  have  someone  who  can  speak  Cantonese.  I  think  the   pharmacists  explained  it  more  clearly.  This  drug  will  cure  this  illness,  and  this  is  how  you   take  it,  don't  do  this  or  that.  The  family  doctor  didn't  say  any  of  this.  They  don't  have   time  to  say  this.  So  I  think  the  pharmacists  have  better  communication  than  the  doctor   (Participant  1001).   Although  both  women  took  care  of  their  teeth,  they  found  dentists  in  Canada  to  be  too   expensive.  Thus,  they  found  other  ways  to  access  dental  care.  "Yes,  every  time  I  go  back  to   China  I  will  go  for  a  dental  checkup.  I  go  to  take  care  of  my  teeth  well  and  clean  my  teeth  well.   Here  [in  Canada]  it's  too  expensive"  (Participant  1001).     Yes,  in  Canada,  I  went  to  clean  my  teeth.  [.  .  .]  The  dentist  is  close  to  where  I  lived.  Teeth   are  very  important.  They  speak  Chinese,  they  are  students.  They  charge  $30  per  visit  .  .  .   Every  step  of  the  way,  they  stop  and  let  the  instructor  check  before  they  move  on  to  the   next  step  (Participant  1002).    The  Cantonese-speaking  women  were  able  to  find  Cantonese-speaking  doctors  and   other  health  professionals  to  provide  them  with  healthcare  services  in  Toronto.  Since  the

community  workers  do  not  only  work  with  Chinese  immigrant  women,  their  responses  were  for   their  clients'  general  experiences.  In  comparison  to  the  Cantonese-speaking  women,  the   community  workers  emphasized  language  among  other  issues  that  caused  difficulties  for   Chinese  immigrant  clients  to  access  healthcare.     I  think  that  although  in  Canada  we  always  say  that  it's  a  human  right,  everyone  can   access  to  different  systems,  but  in  the  system  they  have  already  the  barriers.  If  you   don't  have  language  ability,  you  can't  access  the  services  directly.  That's  why   [organization]  was  established  in  1982,  because  we  want  to  fill  in  this  service  gap  [in   mental  health  services].  [.  .  .]  Especially  I  would  say  that  their  cultural  competence.  Even   though  they  can  speak  English,  if  they  want  to  seek  help,  they  would..  Just  like  if  you  talk   to  your  family  doctor,  most  people  will  find  their  own  language,  Chinese-speaking  family   doctor  instead  of  the  English-speaking  person  (Participant  1003).   Certainly  language  and  physical  challenges.    [.  .  .]  So  first,  language  is  the  first  issue.  If   you  don't  understand,  you  cannot  do  anything.  Then  physical,  something  they  can  learn.   Chinese,  not  many  of  them  use  walkers  or  accessibility  devices,  but  they  need  to  know   how  to  use  that  properly.  And  physically  they  are  old,  they  are  not  turning  around  that   quick  (Participant  1005).   Further  evidence  of  language  issues  and  other  post-migration  challenges  or  systemic  barriers   are  explored  in  the  next  section.  

3.3 Social  Determinants  of  Health  
The  sub-research  question  is  how  does  social  context  influence  Cantonese-speaking   older  women's  health  experiences?  The  social  context  involves  examining  the  social  

   22  

determinants  of  health,  which  includes  personal  characteristics  or  structural  barriers  that   influence  health.  The  main  themes  to  answer  this  question  were  divided  into  systemic  barriers   and  post-migration  challenges.  The  main  themes  have  subthemes  that  further  elaborate  on  the   main  theme.  Subthemes  were  matched  to  the  post-migration  challenge  main  theme  according   to  the  degree  of  agency  an  individual  has  within  that  subtheme.  While  keeping  the  length  of   this  paper  in  mind,  I  aimed  to  allow  participants  to  describe  what  we  are  trying  to  understand  in   their  own  words.  Attempts  were  made  to  summarize  participant  responses  to  each  theme,  but   their  own  words  best  described  what  I  would  like  to  convey  for  them.  The  community  workers   who  work  with  this  population  on  a  regular  basis  often  do  not  get  a  chance  to  talk  about  their   clients.  Their  responses  are  unique  and  valuable,  and  I  would  like  to  keep  most  of  their  quotes   intact  since  most  research  that  I  read  did  not  cover  these  topics  in  much  detail.   3.3.1 Post-migration  Challenges     Immigration  is  a  significant  life  event  for  most  people,  whether  it  is  their  own  choice  or   their  family's  choice.  There  are  many  factors  that  may  make  adjustment  to  the  receiving   country  better  or  worse.  Some  of  these  factors  become  post-migration  challenges  that   immigrants  must  negotiate  with  a  degree  of  agency  and  were  identified  in  the  interviews  with   the  participants.  The  factors  presented  here  are  subthemes  and  include:  language  learning,   immigration  experience,  social  isolation,  geographic  location,  socioeconomic  status,  family   issues  and  different  health  beliefs.  Each  subtheme  is  related  to  other  subthemes.   3.3.1.1 Language  Learning   Learning  a  new  language  can  be  difficult,  especially  at  an  older  age  (CAC,  2008;  Guruge   et  al.,  2009;  Liang  et  al.,  2004).  Both  Cantonese-speaking  women  were  fortunate  to  have  

   23  

learned  some  English  in  China  but  were  not  used  to  speaking  the  language  every  day.  Despite   having  an  adequate  knowledge  of  English,  Participant  1001  told  me  that  she  was  unable  to   navigate  Ryerson  University's  telephone  system  to  contact  me  for  the  research  study.  She   managed  to  email  me  instead.  Her  comments  made  me  realize  that  often  such  details  will  go   unnoticed.  Even  though  both  women  have  LINC  Level  5  English,  they  were  unable  to  feel  at   ease  with  going  to  doctors  who  only  spoke  English.  Participant  1001  reiterated  several  times  in   our  interview  about  her  worry  and  anxiety  about  having  to  see  an  English-speaking  doctor   unexpectedly.     So  when  we  see  a  doctor,  language  is  the  problem.  .  .  .  But  the  medical  terms,  how  to   explain  to  the  doctor  where?  For  example,  pain  has  a  few  levels:  ordinary  pain,  sharp   pain,  acute  pain  etc.  I  find  communication  with  the  doctors  is  difficult  for  me.  [.  .  .]  I   have  to  look  up  the  dictionary  the  night  before  I  go  to  see  the  doctor.  Then  I  go  there   and  say  what  I  looked  up.  But  what  the  doctor  says  I  don't  always  understand  and  I   don't  have  the  dictionary  or  computer  with  me,  so  what  words  are  these?  Every  time  we   go  to  the  hospital,  we  know  it  will  be  difficult  (Participant  1001).   Participant  1002  also  prepares  before  her  doctor  visits:  "I  can  communicate  in  English   with  my  family  doctor  who  is  not  Chinese.  I  first  prepare  beforehand  by  writing  out   things  before  my  visit  with  my  doctor.  [.  .  .]  I  can  still  speak  some  English  or  listen  to   some  but  it  is  slower.  The  previous  family  doctor  was  very  patient  with  me.  He  spoke   English  very  slowly  to  me.  Others  are  not  so  patient.  It  sounded  like  I  was  taking  English   class."   If  a  doctor  is  rushed  to  see  patients  in  limited  amounts  of  time,  they  will  not  have  the  

   24  

tolerance  to  explain  to  the  patient  in  simple  terms  about  the  medical  problem.  Therefore,  it  is   also  healthcare  professionals  who  have  a  role  in  addressing  language  issues  of  their  patients.   The  women  attempted  to  prepare  for  what  they  wanted  to  say  before  a  doctor's  visit,  but  they   could  not  prepare  for  what  the  doctor  will  say  or  for  further  questions  during  the  visit.     The  community  workers  stated  that  recent  immigrants  were  not  the  only  ones  who   needed  language  help  with  accessing  health  services.  Immigrant  women  that  arrived  at  a   younger  age  and  have  lived  in  Canada  for  a  while  may  also  need  help  if  they  did  not  have  the   time  to  learn  English  while  working  to  support  their  families.   There  are  a  lot  of  Chinese  and  Vietnamese.  They  can't  find  services  because  of  the   language  barrier  [.  .  .]  Some  of  them  also  come  to  Canada  for  over  ten  years,  but  they   prefer  to  speak  in  Cantonese  or  Mandarin,  seldom  to  speak  in  English.  When  they  go  to   the  social  circles,  still  they  speak  Cantonese  and  Mandarin  (Participant  1003).     But  older  immigrant  women,  who  have  been  here  for  many  years,  they  worked  their   whole  lifetime,  either  in  the  garment  factory  because  I  know  a  couple  of  them  [that]   said  that  to  me.  That's  the  reason  why  they  don't  speak  English  even  if  they  have  been   here  for  40  years  (Participant  1005).        Learning  a  language  is  a  post-migration  challenge  because  the  decision  to  learn  a  new  

language  also  signifies  migration  from  one  country  to  another  as  a  long-term  decision.   Immigration  is  a  long  process,  and  can  be  another  challenging  experience  for  newcomers,   which  is  examined  in  the  next  section.     3.3.1.2 Immigration  Experience      According  to  the  two  Cantonese-speaking  women  participants,  their  physical  health  was  

   25  

not  significantly  affected  by  the  immigration  experience.  In  fact,  Participant  1002  mentioned   that  the  air  quality  in  Canada  was  much  better  than  in  China,  which  was  better  for  her  physical   health.  In  comparison,  they  spoke  indirectly  about  immigration  having  more  of  an  effect  on   their  mental  health.  Immigration  itself  can  be  stressful,  but  what  about  the  social  context   surrounding  a  person's  preparations  before  and  after?  The  social  context  can  affect  a  person's   psychological  adjustment  to  their  new  country.   The  Cantonese-speaking  women  participants  were  both  sponsored  by  their  adult   children  to  immigrate  to  Canada.  They  both  visited  their  adult  children  in  Canada  prior  to   applying  for  immigration  to  Canada  and  felt  that  they  somewhat  knew  what  to  expect  following   migration.  However,  both  faced  difficulties  during  and  after  immigrating  to  Canada.  One   woman  faced  a  long  application  process  and  family  disruption,  which  was  partially  due  to   immigration.   It  took  well  over  3.5  years  for  my  application  to  go  through  the  process.  [.  .  .]  Originally   my  daughter  tried  to  sponsor  both  of  us  ­  her  mother  and  father,  but  then  she  changed   it  to  only  one.  So  it  is  not  welcoming  us  and  it  is  not  good.  .  .  .  Originally,  my  daughter  is   the  one  who  thought  they  probably  think  how  can  I  support  2  parents,  so  let's  cancel   one  first.  So  we  cancelled  her  father's,  and  originally  he  was  going  to  come  too.  [.  .  .]  I   had  to  file  separation  papers  with  my  husband,  since  he  did  not  want  to  come  to  Canada   (Participant  1002).   Although  the  participant  did  not  further  explain  about  circumstances  surrounding  her   and  her  husband's  separation,  the  fact  that  her  daughter  had  to  choose  only  one  parent  to   sponsor  may  have  played  a  role  in  their  separation.    Consequently,  immigration  was  not  only  an  

   26  

adjustment  of  different  countries'  systems  and  cultures;  it  was  an  adjustment  of  family  life  for   this  participant.  After  being  married  for  over  40  years,  she  now  found  herself  separated  from   her  husband  in  a  new  country.   The  other  Cantonese-speaking  woman  experienced  difficulties  after  arriving  because  her   adult  daughter  sponsored  them  to  immigrate  to  Canada,  but  was  asked  by  her  employer  to   work  in  the  United  States  for  three  years.  Thus,  adjustment  to  Canada  after  immigration  was   left  solely  to  her  and  her  husband,  including  finding  low-cost  housing.   At  first  it  was  hard.  When  we  first  came  in  May  2009,  my  daughter  was  commissioned   by  her  employer  to  the  United  States  in  July  2009.  She  had  to  work  in  the  U.S.  We   bought  a  round  trip  plane  ticket  thinking  of  going  back  to  China  because  I  did  not  know   anyone  here  in  Canada.  Lots  of  people  persuaded  us  to  stay  in  Toronto  because  it  was  a   good  place  to  live.  [.  .  .]  We  put  our  application  in  June  2009  .  .  .  We  lived  in  a  coworker's   place.  There  was  no  interview  or  anything.  In  August,  [they]  asked  if  we  wanted  to  see   the  older  adult's  apartment.  I  said  we  don't  need  to  see  it,  we  will  take  it.  We  decided   not  to  go  to  see  as  we  accepted  any  type  of  home  because  we  were  `homeless.'  We   don't  have  a  choice.  They  said  we  could  take  a  look,  but  I  said  just  give  us  the  keys.  [.  .  .]   People  ask  me  and  I  say  the  difficult  part  has  already  passed,  so  now  it's  considered  very   good  (Participant  1001).      The  community  workers  who  participated  in  the  study  also  highlighted  the  hardships  of  

Chinese  immigrants.  Although  Chinese  from  Hong  Kong  are  ethnically  similar  to  those  from   Mainland  China,  they  vary  in  language  and  in  their  reasons  for  migrating.  Those  from  Hong   Kong  usually  speak  Cantonese,  and  migrated  pre-1997  to  avoid  political  instability.  One  

   27  

community  worker  stated  that  migration  is  a  long-term  process,  which  also  will  influence  how   Canadian  society  views  them  as  immigrants.     Most  of  the  people  before  1997  [immigrated]  because  of  the  political  reasons,  for   educational  and  other  reasons.  Most  of  the  Cantonese  community  arrived,  immigrated   before  1997.  After  that  the  pace  of  immigration  process  seemed  to  slow  down.  That's   why  in  the  past  ten  years,  most  of  the  people  came  from  Mainland  China  and  other   ethnic  groups,  Koreans  or  Filipinos.  Yeah,  that's  why  our  Cantonese  community  is  well   established  in  Toronto,  but  I  always  say  that  migration  is  long  term.  It's  not  just  ok,  you   come  and  then  you  can  settle.    We  still  have  from  day  one  when  they  immigrate,  their   status  is  still  immigrant.  They  can't  change  this,  it's  not  like  [being]  born  in  Canada.  [.  .  .]   Our  target  group  I  can  see  that  99%  are  immigrants.  They  are  not  born  here  (Participant   1003).   Another  community  worker  told  me  that  some  Chinese  older  adults  described  their   circumstances  as  an  "overseas  prison."  A  word  that  was  derived  from  the  Cultural  Revolution  in   China  in  the  1970s  when  young  persons  were  sent  for  hard  farm  work  (    or    )   has  now  been   used  to  describe  older  persons  being  sent  overseas  for  hard  work  (    ) .  In  addition,  she   highlighted  the  fact  that  numerous  family  visitors  supported  their  children  and  the  Canadian   economy  by  performing  unpaid  labour  such  as  childcare.  This  is  in  contrast  to  attitudes  from   government  officials  that  family  class  immigrants  do  not  contribute  to  the  Canadian  economy   (Preston  et  al.,  2013). Then  we  have  some  seniors,  they  are  on  a  visitor's  visa,  visiting  friends  or  family.  .  .  .   They  are  doing  labour,  not  a  paid  job.  That  means  they  are  raising  their  grandchildren

for  no  pay  or  taking  care  of  the  families.  Some  of  the  seniors  say  they  are  providing  the   quality  labour  for  the  Canadian  economy  and  nobody  noticed.  We  know  about  it,  but   policy-wise  they  think  they  are  a  burden.  We  like  to  bring  that  issue  there,  because  they   really  raise  that  issue.  We  [visitors]  are  providing  you  guys  quality  labour  and  we're   doing  all  chores  without  pay.  We  don't  use  your  system.  Because  when  they  come,  they   have  to  buy  their  healthcare  insurance,  right?  So  it's  not  that  they  are  consuming  our   system,  indeed  they  have  to  pay  quite  a  lot  in  order  to  stay.  [.  .  .]  Yeah  that's  what  they   said,  I'm  in  a  prison.  .  .  Because  it  used  to  be  in  revolutionary  time  in  Mainland  China,   the  younger  one  goes  to  the  rural  area  right.  Now  it's  like  that  bunch  of  people  getting   older,  they  are  the  ones  who  come  to  visit  their  younger  ones  that  are  here.  They  say   it's  reversed  because  you  are  thinking  of  overseas  in  North  America  is  really  good  but   actually  it's  another  prison  for  them.  It's  called  overseas  prison  (Participant  1005).   The  Cantonese-speaking  women  likely  explained  a  mild  version  of  the  hardships  they   endured  when  immigrating  to  Canada.  The  community  workers  regularly  saw  the  difficulties   that  their  clients  experienced,  which  can  be  the  way  that  one  is  treated  due  to  a  lingering   immigrant  status  or  living  in  an  "overseas  prison."  From  the  experiences  of  the  Cantonese- speaking  women  and  the  community  workers,  there  is  a  strong  link  between  the  role  of  family   and  immigration.  Yet  Chinese  older  adults  often  immigrate  due  to  family  but  arrive  in  Canada   without  a  social  network.  The  role  of  family  will  be  further  explored  in  another  section  but  older   Chinese  adults  are  vulnerable  to  social  isolation,  which  will  be  explored  in  the  next  section.

3.3.1.3 Social  Isolation      Older  adults'  mental  health  can  be  affected  by  social  isolation  that  they  may  experience  

in  the  post-migration  context.  Both  Cantonese-speaking  women  had  immigrated  to  Canada   without  relatives  or  friends  other  than  their  adult  children.  One  participant  noted  if  their   children  were  not  available,  then  this  situation  could  create  challenges  in  learning  different   ways  of  functioning  in  a  new  country.     In  those  days,  there  wasn't  much  stress  or  burden,  but  our  feelings  were  not  so  good.   We  thought,  our  daughter  sponsored  us  to  immigrate  but  then  she  herself  left  and  left   us  here.  [.  .  .]  At  that  time  [after  immigrating],  if  you  wanted  someone  to  help  there  was   no  one  (Participant  1001).   The  Canadian  winters  create  even  more  challenges  for  older  adult  immigrants  who  are   already  experiencing  social  isolation.  The  participants  who  were  accustomed  to  a  warm,   southern  Chinese  climate  had  to  adjust  to  snow  and  ice  in  Canada.  They  were  very  conscious  of   the  dangers  of  slipping  and  falling,  and  Participant  1002  chose  to  avoid  going  outside  in  the   winter.     The  winter  lasts  about  4  months.  In  the  winter  season,  I  mostly  stayed  at  home  and  I   feel  comfortable.  But  if  I  stayed  home  for  the  entire  season,  it  is  no  good.  [.  .  .]  In  winter,   I  really  don't  want  to  go  out.  That  is  not  good  for  my  health  and  well-being  (Participant   1002).      Both  women  preferred  to  keep  busy  and  leave  the  house  to  socialize  with  others.  

"For  me,  too  much  time  at  home  is  not  good.  .  .  .  We  don't  like  to  stay  at  home  because  then   we  would  become  lazy"  (Participant  1001).  "I  like  to  get  out  of  the  house  for  a  change  of  

   30  

scenery,  it  is  better  for  me.  [.  .  .]  I  sometimes  borrow  her  [daughter's]  bus  pass.  I  feel  better   when  I  go  out"  (Participant  1002).  It  could  be  that  Participant  1002  would  like  more  social   interaction  as  a  reason  for  wanting  to  work  or  volunteer  to  get  out  of  the  house.  "In  Toronto,  I   would  like  to  look  for  jobs,  for  full-time  or  part-time,  $12  per  hour,  or  I  would  volunteer.  I  do   not  demand  anything  in  return"  (Participant  1002).      A  community  worker  participant  who  worked  directly  with  older  adults  noted  that  social  

isolation  was  the  most  common  problem  that  they  needed  help  with.  Some  older  adult   immigrants  described  being  socially  isolated  as  an  "overseas  prison"  in  the  previous  section.   She  provided  them  with  "social  medicine"  and  described  an  example  of  its  results  with  one  of   her  clients.  Consequently,  she  enjoyed  providing  help  to  address  their  social  isolation.     Most  of  our  clients,  they  are  isolated.  They  wanted  to  come  out  to  seek  help,  but  that's   kind  of  a  group  of  clients.  If  they  are  lucky  to  get  support  from  our  case  management,   that  would  be  fine.  But  most  of  them  are  just  isolated.  [.  .  .]    That's  what  he  was  telling   me,  until  later  on  he  find  some  people,  he  starts  to  learn  English,  so  he  went  to  the  class   and  know  some  other  seniors,  then  he  feels  better.  Then  the  class  keeps  him  going,  so   then  he  find  us  and  he  loves  us  because  after  the  grandchildren  were  born  he  loves  us.   Then  he  comes  too  often.  `See  I  don't  see  my  doctor,  I  haven't  seen  him  for  over  a  year.'   But  I  said,  `you  need  to  do  your  physical.'  He  says  `no  I'm  totally  fine,  I  don't  think  I  need   it,  I  don't  see  why  I  was  sick  that  time,'  something  like  that.  So  I  call  my  group,  social   medicine  to  treat  seniors'  isolation.  .  .  .  So  I  feel  very  good  from  doing  that  because  I  feel   them  connect  and  support  each  other,  they  feel  energetic,  that  sense  of  belonging  to   each  other,  supporting  their  social  net.  It's  so  important,  I  thought  I'm  totally  doing  the  

   31  

right  thing!  It  feels  so  good  (Participant  1005).   This  community  worker  also  noticed  that  her  Chinese  clients  engaged  in  activities   according  to  their  marital  status.  Married  couples  attended  programs  together,  while  widowers   would  attend  programs  alone.  There  would  not  be  any  summer  programs  for  older  non-Chinese   adults,  but  older  Chinese  adults  requested  more  summer  programs.      The  Cantonese-speaking  women  participants  did  not  emphasize  the  social  isolation  in  

their  lives,  however  they  did  allude  to  how  good  it  felt  to  be  outside  of  their  house  and  to  keep   busy.  Participant  1002  was  especially  prone  to  staying  at  home  in  the  winter  since  she  was  not   used  to  the  different  climate  yet.  The  community  worker  underlined  the  issue  of  social  isolation   among  older  adults,  especially  the  benefits  derived  from  having  a  group  support  program  in   place.  Older  Chinese  immigrant  adults  also  may  display  social  patterns  that  differ  from  older   non-Chinese  adults.  The  geographic  location  of  residence  may  play  a  role  in  older  adults'   isolation.  Subsequently,  this  factor  will  be  explored  in  the  next  section.   3.3.1.4 Geographic  Location      The  geographic  location  of  a  person  can  sometimes  be  overlooked  as  a  factor  that  

impacts  health.  Yet  the  findings  of  this  study  highlighted  that  proximity  to  health  services  did   impact  the  choice  of  family  doctor  for  these  Cantonese-speaking  women.  "My  family  doctor   speaks  Cantonese,  just  a  5  minute  walk  and  we  would  be  there"  (Participant  1001).  In   comparison,  Participant  1002  noted:  "I  wish  it  could  be  walking  distance  then  it  would  be  more   convenient.  I  take  the  bus  to  the  other  clinic  and  transfer  to  another  bus.    It  takes  more  than   half  an  hour  but  not  an  hour."      Both  women  lived  in  Toronto  neighbourhoods  with  substantial  numbers  of  Chinese,  but  

   32  

downplayed  the  possible  benefits  of  having  convenient  access  to  banks  or  grocery  stores  that   cater  to  Chinese  people.  It  may  be  that  they  are  accustomed  to  these  services,  which  could  be   similar  to  circumstances  in  China  so  that  they  do  not  realize  that  these  services  may  not  be   available  in  other  areas  of  Toronto.  The  community  worker  participants  also  highlighted  the   importance  of  proximity  in  terms  of  the  adjustments  that  some  Chinese  immigrants  needed  to   make  when  living  in  Canada.  For  example,  one  community  worker  emphasized  that  some  older   Chinese  adults  only  stayed  in  their  neighbourhood.     The  older  immigrants,  they  have  been  here  50  years,  40  years,  like  the  older  senior   Chinese  women,  but  they  still  are  bounded  in  Chinatown,  in  this  area  I  mean.  So   literally,  they  don't  know  much  English,  don't  know  what  is  going  on  in  the  real  world.   They  live  in  this  neighbourhood,  they've  got  their  neighbours,  they  shop  here   (Participant  1005).   According  to  one  of  the  community  worker  participants,  some  immigrants  had  a  hard   time  adjusting  to  the  suburban  nature  of  Canadians  cities  in  terms  of  managing  everyday  tasks.   "Maybe  here  if  you  don't  have  driving  skills,  [then]  maybe  you  are  limited  to  your  living  area"   (Participant  1003).  This  statement  also  becomes  important  when  considering  older  Chinese   adults  in  the  Greater  Toronto  Area  (GTA),  who  are  more  difficult  to  find  and  are  likely  more   socially  isolated.  "In  Toronto  at  least  it's  better,  they  still  have  TTC  but  if  you  live  in  GTA,  I  mean   905  area,  you  have  to  drive.  That  really,  really  challenges  ­  they  are  really  isolated.  And  they   don't  have  much  [social]  programming  either"  (Participant  1005).   Older  immigrants  who  have  limited  income  may  prefer  to  walk  even  though  transit  is   accessible  in  the  Toronto  city  area.  This  was  highlighted  by  Participant  1001,  who  reported  

   33  

walking  to  the  nearest  hospital  instead  of  spending  money  on  transit  fare.  "I  walk  about  an   hour  to  St.  Michael's  Hospital  which  is  far  but  the  closest  one.  The  other  one  is  Toronto  Eastern   Hospital"  (Participant  1001).   These  statements  demonstrated  that  proximity  of  health  services  could  be  a  factor  in   seeking  healthcare  and  other  services.    From  the  above  discussion,  socioeconomic  situation   also  affected  older  immigrant  women's  access  to  healthcare,  which  is  explored  in  the  next   section.   3.3.1.5 Socioeconomic  Status   Socioeconomic  status  affects  individuals'  health  choices,  but  the  impact  may  be  more   evident  for  some  people  than  others.  For  example,  the  two  Cantonese-speaking  women   participants  in  this  study  made  certain  choices  due  to  their  limited  finances  ­  limited  transit   use,  refraining  from  using  Chinese  herbalists,  and  choosing  lower-cost  options  for  dental   services.  However,  overall  Participant  1002  appeared  to  be  less  affected  by  a  limited  income   than  Participant  1001.  Although  Participant  1001  has  a  part-time  job,  she  mentioned  several   times  in  our  interview  that  she  did  not  have  a  pension  yet  and  needed  to  save  money.     We  have  to  be  very  exact  about  each  dollar  we  spend.  We  have  to  think  about  whether   it  is  important  to  spend  it.    For  using  transportation,  we  usually  just  walk.  If  we  can  walk   there  in  about  an  hour,  then  we  will.  If  we  don't  need  to  spend  it,  we  won't.  I  work  and   get  a  little  income,  but  during  [school]  holidays  then  there  is  no  work  and  no  income   (Participant  1001).        Participant  1001  was  diligent  about  her  health,  but  her  doctor's  office  charged  for  

copies  of  medical  reports  at  $1  per  page.  "We  don't  want  to  spend  our  money  for  this.  I  also  

   34  

think  that  medical  reports  belong  to  the  patient  and  they  are  patients'  own  possessions"   (Participant  1001).  She  also  noted  that  to  transfer  her  records  to  another  doctor,  it  would  cost   over  $10.  She  demonstrated  that  for  those  with  limited  income,  tracking  their  own  health   through  medical  reports  and  getting  a  second  opinion  for  medical  advice  might  not  be  possible.   Participant  1005  revealed  that  most  older  immigrant  Chinese  women  that  she  knew   lived  in  subsidized  housing  (apartments)  in  which  there  were  health  and  safety  concerns,   among  others.  The  older  adults  did  not  have  a  pension,  thus  relied  on  their  adult  children  to   support  them,  and  subsidized  housing  was  still  costly  for  them.  However,  it  is  important  to  keep   in  mind  that  the  sociodemographics  of  Participant  1005's  service  location  differs  from   Participant  1003's  service  location.  Participant  1003  stated  that  older  immigrants  did  not   always  rely  on  their  adult  children.  Instead  among  her  clients,  often  it  was  older  immigrants   who  supported  their  adult  children  financially.    "Especially  [with]  the  housing  prices  going  up,   that's  why  most  of  the  people,  instead  of  asking  the  children  to  support  them,  it's  reverse.  The   parents  support  the  children  to  buy  the  condo  or  house,  especially  the  first  payment"   (Participant  1003).   It  is  possible  that  those  who  have  limited  incomes  are  also  more  likely  in  need  of   healthcare  services.  For  the  older  adults  that  lived  in  subsidized  housing,  they  might  need  to  be   monitored  more  closely  for  health  issues  linked  to  living  in  environments  with  poor  health  and   safety  conditions.  Yet  the  realities  of  the  Cantonese-speaking  women  and  community  workers'   clients  highlight  that  their  individual  socioeconomic  situation  is  very  much  influenced  by   societal  factors  (i.e.,  housing  costs,  Canadian  medical  system  costs)  but  family  also  played  an   important  role.  The  latter  is  explored  in  the  next  section.

3.3.1.6 Family  Issues      Many  older  adults  are  sponsored  as  family  class  immigrants  by  their  adult  children.  

Dependency  on  family  members  for  one's  immigration  status  can  create  hardships  for  older   adults  who  do  not  want  conflicts  with  their  adult  children.  Avoiding  conflicts  is  part  of  saving   face,  which  is  a  social  rule  that  is  valued  in  Chinese  culture.  Saving  face  relates  to  a  social  value   that  others  give  to  a  person  based  on  their  social  position  (Heine,  2012).  Avoiding  conflicts   becomes  a  health  issue  when  it  affects  the  help-seeking  behaviours  for  the  health  of  older   Chinese  adults.  This  issue  was  identified  in  the  interviews  with  community  workers,  and  was   also  highlighted  by  one  of  the  Cantonese-speaking  women  participants.  The  interviews  with  the   women  indicated  that  the  parents  tried  to  avoid  any  potential  conflict  with  their  adult  children   by  not  burdening  them  with  their  financial  or  health  problems.  For  example,  Participant  1001   avoided  asking  for  money  from  her  adult  children.     My  son  and  daughter  said  they  would  support  us  [her  and  her  husband],  but  I  don't   want  my  son's  and  daughter's  financial  support.  They  have  their  own  needs  like  buying  a   house,  getting  married,  etc.  so  we  don't  want  to  use  their  savings.  [.  .  .]  This  is   something  we  don't  talk  about  at  our  age,  we  don't  want  to  be  a  burden  to  our   daughter  (Participant  1001).     She  also  did  not  want  to  live  with  her  daughter  to  avoid  conflicts.  "Since  there  is  a  generation   gap  if  we  live  together,  it  is  easy  to  have  conflicts  with  each  other.  That  would  be  an   embarrassment  for  me.  If  we  live  apart,  we  treat  each  other  respectfully"  (Participant  1001).  It   is  noted  that  although  Participant  1001  has  an  adult  son  in  Toronto,  she  rarely  spoke  about  him.      Avoiding  conflicts  meant  that  her  and  her  husband  were  left  to  navigate  the  healthcare

system  on  their  own.  "My  children  are  so  busy  so  they  can't  come  to  the  doctor  when  we're   sick,  so  we  have  to  manage  it  ourselves  without  knowing  the  system"  (Participant  1001).  A   community  worker  participant  also  spoke  about  this  issue.   Or  they  don't  know  who  they  should  turn  to  for  support,  usually  it's  family  support  but   the  family  is  not  as  extended  as  back  home.  They  can  only  rely  on  their  children  and   they  say  I  feel  so  bad,  sorry  for  my  son  ­  he  has  to  take  a  day  off  to  bring  me  to  the   appointment  or  if  they  have  an  examination  or  test,  they  [are]  really  scared  for  them.  [.  .   .]  Yeah,  they  feel  themselves  are  a  burden  to  their  sons  or  daughters.  So  they  feel  guilty   for  doing  that,  but  sometimes  it's  necessary,  right?  You  need  early  detection  [of  health   problems]  (Participant  1005).     Many  adult  children  (in  the  "sandwich  generation")  cannot  assist  their  sponsored  parents  with   timely  medical  care  due  to  a  combination  of  work  demands,  medical  wait  times,  their  own   children  and  sometimes  simply  due  to  a  lack  of  enough  time  in  their  life.  Sponsored  parents  are   then  left  to  navigate  the  Canadian  healthcare  system  on  their  own  without  the  same   knowledge  of  someone  who  is  born  in  Canada  or  with  the  same  language  capabilities.        In  contrast  to  avoiding  conflict,  the  community  workers  also  identified  intergenerational  

conflict  because  of  differing  cultural  and  societal  values.  One  community  worker  participant   elaborated  on  family  conflicts  over  differing  cultural  values  in  the  following  manner:   Yes  certainly,  family  conflict    ­  the  communication  part  or  the  traditional  beliefs  and   traditional  values  collide  with  Western  culture.  It's  always  an  issue.  Older  seniors,  they   have  been  here  for  a  while,  they  always  heard  some  stories  so  they  know.  They  say,  oh   our  grandchildren,  we  have  to  raise  this  way,  we  cannot  spank  them.  Grandparents

don't  usually  do  that,  it's  the  parents  that  intervene.  They  say  oh  my  son  works  so  hard,   that's  my  in-laws,  I  can't  say  anything  because  this  is  Canada.  So  if  they  have  been  here   for  a  long  time,  they  know  there's  different  value  systems.  But  the  [newcomer]  older   immigrant  women,  they  complain  a  lot.  They  complain  about  their  in-laws,  their   daughter  in-law,  they  say  oh  my  gosh  I  came  to  Canada  and  do  this,  this,  this  and  they   don't  even  show  their  respect.  They  probably  show  their  respect  in  a  different  way,   that's  what  I  always  tell  them  (Participant  1005).   Intergenerational  family  conflict  can  affect  older  adults'  mental  health,  however  this  was  not   addressed  in  any  of  the  interviews.  Yet,  the  conflict  is  not  necessarily  just  intergenerational  but   also  between  personal  attitudes  towards  the  Chinese  and  the  Canadian  health  belief  systems,   which  is  explored  in  the  next  section.     3.3.1.7 Different  Health  Beliefs   The  differences  between  Chinese  health  beliefs,  along  with  the  use  of  Traditional   Chinese  Medicine  (TCM)  and  Western  health  beliefs  were  evident  in  the  interviews.  A  brief   description  of  TCM  is  that  it  is  based  on  yin-yang  natural  forces  that  are  opposite,  yet  dynamic   and  interdependent  (Tang,  Liu  &  Ma,  2008).    In  TCM,  yin  refers  to  the  organ  itself,  yang  involves   the  function  of  the  organ,  while  Qi  (energy)  and  blood  is  circulated  in  the  body  (Tang,  Liu  &  Ma,   2008).  Disease  occurs  if  there  is  a  disturbance  to  yin-yang,  Qi  or  blood  flow,  or  disharmony  in   the  organs  due  to  mood,  lifestyle  or  climatic  factors  (hot/cold;  Tang,  Liu  &  Ma,  2008).   Treatment  involves  expelling  or  suppressing  the  cause  and  restoring  balance  (Tang,  Liu  &  Ma,   2008).       The  Cantonese-speaking  women  participants  preferred  certain  elements  of  TCM  and  

   38  

retained  Chinese  health  beliefs  for  maintaining  their  health.  Both  women  did  not  like  to  take   medications  without  knowing  the  side  effects  and  implications  on  their  body.  Both  women  also   believed  in  balanced,  nutritional  meals  that  kept  the  hot/cold  balance  (related  to  yin/yang).   However,  there  was  not  a  dichotomy  between  the  Chinese  and  Western  health  beliefs.     One  doctor's  touch,  the  entire  body  will  be  healed.  Each  time  there  was  a  sore  throat,   my  mother  would  take  me  to  see  the  Chinese  herbalist/doctor  and  it  would  not  be  very   expensive  and  like  that,  my  throat  would  not  be  sore.  [.  .  .]  I  bought  some  Chinese  herbs   for  myself  to  boil  soup/tonics  for  myself.  In  spring  I  take  Chinese  medicine  for  my   osteoporosis.  [.  .  .]  I  believe  in  both  medicines.    It  depends  on  what  kind  of  illness.  Both   would  be  good.  I  like  the  Chinese  herbalists'  approach;  they  covered  the  entire  body,   not  just  an  organ,  very  detailed  and  crystal  clear  (Participant  1002).     I  believe  in  Chinese  herbal  medicine  because  they  started  from  yin  and  yang.  If  I  go  back   to  China,  I  would  bring  back  some  Chinese  herbal  ingredients  for  soup  .  .  .  They  are  not   for  curing  illnesses.  Also  some  Chinese  tea  .  .  .  they  are  good  for  your  yin  &  yang  in  your   body  or  sore  throats.  I  believe  Chinese  medicine  is  very  good.  Western  medicine  is  for   fast  cure  but  I  don't  like  taking  all  the  medications.  Chinese  medicine  looks  at  the  whole   person  and  how  to  correct  the  imbalance.  I  also  believe  in  Western  medicine.  The   doctors  are  very  knowledgeable  in  treating  fevers  or  other  disease.    They  don't  correct   yin  and  yang  imbalance  though.  [.  .  .]  It  depends  on  the  type  of  illness.  If  serious  illness,   then  Western  medicine.  I  like  that  they  have  many  methods  like  CT  or  MRI  and  the   results  can  be  found  quickly.  Chinese  medicine  doesn't  have  this,  they  rely  on  listening   to  your  pulse.  If  it's  a  serious  illness,  I  want  Western  medicine  but  if  preventive  care  or  

   39  

illness  prevention,  then  I  would  believe  in  Chinese  medicine  (Participant  1001).     The  community  worker  participants  reported  similar  health  beliefs  from  their  clients,   who  adopted  a  holistic  approach  to  the  body.  Most  clients  used  both  Chinese  and  Western   health  approaches.  One  community  worker  reported  that  some  of  her  clients  do  not  believe  in   Western  medicine  (perhaps  in  relation  to  mental  health)  though.     They  just  trust  traditional  and  don't  believe  Western.  But  our  Chinese  traditional   [medicine],  the  effect  is,  you  can't  see  it  immediately.  That's  long  term.  We  always  say   that  it's  strengthening  your  foundation.    But  for  the  medication,  Western  medication   can  have  instant  effect  (Participant  1003).   She  noted  that  clients  might  adopt  a  multidisciplinary  approach  for  treatment  in   addition  to  medication,  including  exercise.  Some  might  not  adopt  Western  medical  treatment,   but  instead  use  acupuncture  or  massages.  This  was  another  reason  that  some  Chinese   preferred  a  Chinese  doctor  due  to  their  awareness  of  other  Chinese  methods  of  treatment.   Take  the  example,  ok  when  they  have  insomnia  -  a  sleeping  problem.  If  they  go  to  a   Chinese-speaking  doctor,  they  will  let  them  know  about,  other  than  the  sleeping  pills,   they  would  also  use  some  Chinese  methods.  For  example,  acupuncture  and  the  massage   and  also  maybe  before  going  to  sleep,  they  will  put  their  feet  in  hot  water.  That's   different,  you  know  what  I  mean?  But  that's  why  if  you  are  an  English-speaking  doctor,   you  don't  understand  why  [people]  distrust  the  pills,  the  sleeping  pills.  But  if  you  come   from  the  Chinese  culture,  the  doctor  can  understand  why  the  patient  will  do  this  way   (Participant  1003).   The  other  community  worker  participant  could  not  promote  the  Chinese  approach

because  of  her  organization's  mandate.  She  did  acknowledge  the  differences  in  health   approaches  as  reasons  for  intergenerational  conflict.   They  [The  clients]  are  very  emphasized  on  the  holistic  approach.  They  look  at  the  body   as  yin  and  yang,  that's  the  traditional.  .  .  .  We  talk  about  that  too  but  we  don't  promote   such  things  in  our  centre  because  we  are  Western  medicine,  but  we  won't  criticize  them   either.  So  they  practice  tai  chi,  they  practice  all  kinds  of  things,  if  they  find  it's  relevant   or  meaningful  to  them  then  that's  fine  I  guess.  Yeah  they  talk  to  us  about  their  herbal,   the  magic/functional  food,  talk  about  that.  That's  the  reason  for  family  conflict  because   of  their  beliefs  with  their  children  or  adult  children  or  in-laws,  there's  mixed  families  too   right?  [.  .  .]  They  even  have  the  cupping  things.  The  cupping,  they  use  on  grandchildren   for  cupping  but  their  adult  children  won't  allow  because  it  leaves  marks,  it's  hard  to   explain  in  school.  But  they  say  it's  useful.  It  is  useful.  They  don't  want  to  get  questioned   (Participant  1005).   The  Cantonese-speaking  women  participants  were  a  lot  like  other  older  Chinese  adults   that  the  community  workers  have  spoken  with.  They  adopted  both  Chinese  and  Western   approaches  to  health.  In  the  Discussion  chapter  this  factor  will  be  discussed,  along  with  further   analysis  of  the  Canadian  healthcare  system.  The  numerous  post-migration  challenges  from  the   participant  interviews  showed  that  these  factors  influenced  physical  and  mental  health  for   Cantonese-speaking  women  and  the  Chinese  immigrant  community.   3.3.2 Systemic  Barriers   While  there  is  some  degree  of  agency  in  the  post-migration  challenges  and  a  diversity  of   experiences,  systemic  barriers  are  social  structures  that  cannot  be  avoided  when  interacting  

   41  

with  the  Canadian  healthcare  system.  The  systemic  barriers  identified  within  the  interviews  are:   cultural  barriers,  healthcare  services  for  Chinese,  and  government  funding  with  participant   recommendations  for  improvements.   3.3.2.1 Cultural  Barriers      There  are  many  differences  between  Chinese  and  Canadian  cultures.  These  differences  

are  especially  noted  in  two  subthemes  of  the  participant  interviews:  cultural  confusion  and   mental  health.       3.3.2.1.1 Cultural  Confusion     The  Cantonese-speaking  women  participants  did  not  talk  about  culture  shock  or   differences  in  their  habits,  however  the  Chinese  clients  of  the  community  worker  participants   noticed  the  cultural  differences  between  their  sending  country  and  Canadian  society.  One   community  worker  described  it  as  culture  shock  for  some  of  her  clients.     But  for  the  women,  for  the  Cantonese  community  I  mentioned  that  they  have  another,   face  a  different  type  of  issue.  Even  though  the  second  generation,  they  came  early,   maybe  they  have  come  from  maybe  around  5  years  old,  they  still  face  another  culture   shock.  And  sometimes  people  have  different  values  in  our  Chinese  traditional  culture,   maybe  we  need  to  have  a  different  respect.  But  here  when  you  are  brought  up  here  you   will  more  emphasize  on  the  individual  for  example  (Participant  1003).   A  community  worker  that  works  with  both  older  non-Chinese  adults  and  older  Chinese   adults  noticed  a  big  cultural  difference  surrounding  the  topic  of  wills  and  estates,  which  relates   to  another  taboo  subject  for  Chinese:  death.  Death  is  not  discussed  openly  in  Chinese  culture,   so  no  older  Chinese  adults  attended  a  workshop  about  wills  and  estate  planning  even  though  

   42  

some  have  lived  in  Canada  for  decades.     Yeah,  I  had  a  will  and  estate  planning  session.  No  Chinese  coming.  They  don't  want  to   face  that.  Maybe  they  think  there's  not  much  left,  but  for  the  older  seniors  they  are   supposed  to  know  more.  But  still,  that's  something  hard  to  face  for  them  too   (Participant  1005).   The  diversity  of  countries  that  Chinese  immigrants  come  from  means  that  it  is  important   to  be  mindful  of  their  possible  heterogeneity.  Participant  1003  mentioned  the  differences   between  Hong  Kong  and  Mainland  China:  two  countries  that  had  different  political  ideologies   and  therefore  somewhat  different  upbringings  for  Chinese  people.  Other  Chinese  clients  she   has  encountered  were  from  Central  America,  since  their  families  searched  for  a  better  life  there   and  could  speak  Cantonese  and  English.  However,  their  children  may  have  identity  confusion   since  they  were  born  in  Mexico,  Cuba  or  Jamaica,  are  ethnically  Chinese  but  now  live  in  Canada.   If  their  social  identities  cannot  be  negotiated  in  a  satisfactory  way,  this  can  lead  to  losses  in   social  support  and  other  psychological  distress  (Heine,  2012).  Culture  and  mental  health  was   also  a  significant  theme  in  the  interviews,  and  this  will  be  examined  further  in  the  next  section.   3.3.2.1.2 Mental  Health   The  stigma  surrounding  mental  health  issues  in  Chinese  culture  is  not  a  new  discovery   (Fang,  2010).  The  Chinese  cultural  norm  of  limited  help-seeking  behaviours  from  outside  the   family  for  personal  problems  is  also  not  relatively  new  (Chen,  Kazanjian  &  Wong,  2009).  As  a   result,  mental  health  is  a  difficult  subject  to  directly  ask  Chinese  participants  about.  Cultural   norms  that  are  related  to  saving  face  dictate  that  one  does  not  disclose  any  personal  problems   to  strangers,  which  also  means  that  seeking  help  outside  of  the  family  can  be  considered

shameful  to  some  (Kramer  et  al.,  2002).  Direct  questions  about  mental  health  were  not  asked  in   our  interviews.  Instead,  questions  about  stress,  life  satisfaction,  or  unexplained  health   problems  were  posed  to  the  Cantonese-speaking  participants.  Mostly  standard  answers  were   given.  Participant  1001  admitted  to  having  sleep  problems  after  immigration  due  to  excessive   thinking  and  worries  before  bedtime.    She  avoided  taking  an  advanced  level  English  class  to   prevent  more  anxiety  and  triggering  higher  blood  pressure.        Participant  1002  was  indirect  about  her  mental  health.  She  was  anxious  to  meet  for  our  

interview  and  called  several  times  before  our  meeting  to  ensure  that  we  would  not  miss  each   other.  In  her  responses,  it  seemed  that  she  would  be  happy  to  get  out  of  the  house  more.  She   had  unexplained  shoulder  and  knee  pain,  which  could  possibly  be  from  stress  or  not  enough   physical  activity.  She  talked  about  one  racist  incident,  which  might  continue  to  affect  her  self- esteem.  "I  had  some  experience  with  people  who  looked  down  upon  Asians.  They  swore  at  me.   I  heard  that  and  I  understand  that"  (Participant  1002).  She  included  in  an  answer  to  one   question  about  describing  her  health  that  she  was  not  worried  about  dying  or  had  any  regrets   when  she  died.  Her  response  seemed  out  of  place  for  such  a  general  question  and  in  breaking   the  Chinese  taboo  about  death.  Her  response  to  the  life  satisfaction  question  was  in  a  neutral   tone,  although  her  response  was  that  she  is  satisfied  with  her  life  now.  She  did  not  elaborate   further  about  that  question  and  actually  started  to  prepare  to  leave,  although  we  were  almost   finished  the  interview.  She  was  similar  to  many  Chinese  who  cannot  talk  about  personal   problems  with  strangers,  but  the  social  context  clues  were  there.  At  least  two  major  factors   that  affected  her  mental  health  were  likely  that  she  recently  separated  from  her  husband  of   over  40  years  and  was  still  adjusting  to  living  in  Canadian  society  as  a  new  immigrant.

Participant  1002  is  someone  who  could  use  counseling  or  mental  health  support  in   Western  psychology  terms,  but  as  both  community  workers  stated,  using  words  such  as   counseling  or  mental  health  around  the  Chinese  community  will  not  attract  clients.  Instead,   modifications  to  psychological  terms  need  to  be  made  for  Chinese  clients  to  use  services   surrounding  mental  health.  Participant  1003  organized  workshops  for  the  community  but  chose   the  title,  "relief  from  anxiety"  for  talking  about  anxiety  disorders.  She  used  different  strategies   for  people  to  be  aware  of  their  mental  health  issues,  and  subjects  that  can  relate  to  everyone   such  as  talking  about  mood.   I  mentioned  before  [about]  the  managing  emotions,  we  also  adopt  the  CBT  [cognitive   behavioural  therapy]  approach.  We  will  talk  about  emotion  ABCs.  But  we  will  not  say  to   the  clients,  to  our  participants,  oh  now  we  adopt  CBT,  we  will  just  talk  about  it.  We  work   with  the  community,  we  use  layman  [words],  we  seldom  use  the  psychological,  the   Greek  psychology.  For  them,  it's  meaningless,  they  just  want  to  know  how  to  treat   themselves  (Participant  1003).     The  lady  was  grieving  that  time,  you  know  she  needs  counseling  but  you  cannot  say  it's   counseling.  Just  say,  we  will  have  some  people  help  you,  you  can  talk  to  her,  she  might   help  you  to  find  something.  Yeah,  so  you  really  cannot  use  such  words  like  counseling   (Participant  1005).     Other  issues  surrounding  mental  health  were  discussed  with  community  workers  who   could  speak  more  openly  about  the  subject  compared  to  the  Cantonese-speaking  participants.   One  community  worker  acknowledged  the  limited  help-seeking  behaviours  among  Chinese.   "We  always  say  that,  we  will  try  to  solve  the  issue  or  problem  by  ourselves  instead  of  going  to  

   45  

the  community  to  seek  help  because  they  always  have  a  Chinese  belief  from  the  older   generation,  the  teaching"  (Participant  1003).        The  inability  for  Chinese  to  express  mental  health  issues  openly  means  that  a  more  

socially  acceptable  manner  is  to  display  physical  symptoms.  One  community  worker  gave  an   example  of  one  of  her  clients.   He  said  when  he  came  here  he's  family  reunion  [status],  the  children  brought  him  here   but  he  has  nothing  to  do,  he  doesn't  speak  English,  he  doesn't  understand  so  he  cannot   go  out.  .  .  .  He  said  he  was  so  sick,  physically  sick  not  mentally  sick,  [but]  it  was   depression,  depressed.  But  he  thinks  he's  physically,  something's  wrong  physically.  So   he  goes  to  see  the  family  doctor  and  after  a  3  month  period,  he  found  a  family  doctor   and  goes  to  see  him  every  week.  .  .  .  So  he  went  to  the  doctor  all  the  time.  The  doctor   told  him  not  to  come  in  to  see  him  (Participant  1005).   It  was  her  older  Chinese  adults  group,  her  "social  medicine"  that  stopped  him  from  trying  to  see   the  doctor  every  week  and  lifted  his  depression.  Yet  the  doctor  did  not  know  about  the   patient's  social  context  to  understand  that  it  was  a  mental  health  issue,  not  a  physical  one.   Doctors  need  to  be  more  aware  of  psychological  issues  that  can  present  themselves  physically   in  all  patients,  but  especially  with  Chinese  patients.   While  the  cultural  barrier  surrounding  mental  health  exists  in  Chinese  culture,  the   community  worker  participants  aim  to  help  the  Chinese  community  to  solve  their  mental  health   issues.  Participant  1005  facilitates  an  older  Chinese  adults'  group  that  allows  them  to  discuss   health  topics  and  provide  social  support  to  solve  their  issues.  Participant  1003  organizes  mental   health  workshops  with  a  variety  of  titles  that  addresses  mental  health  issues  in  an  indirect  way.

She  found  that  most  of  her  clients  prefer  to  solve  health  issues  or  concerns  themselves  instead   of  asking  their  children  to  help.  She  has  also  participated  on  a  Toronto  radio  program  on   AM1430  with  TCM  practitioners  and  a  Chinese  medical  school  student  to  discuss  with  some   patients  about  their  use  of  TCM  to  treat  their  depression.  Her  organization  also  runs  a  family   support  group  for  those  with  family  members  with  mental  health  issues  and  advice  for  them.   She  found  that  often,  family  members  are  unwilling  to  violate  the  family  relationship  to  commit   a  family  member  to  get  help,  even  if  they  hurt  themselves  or  others.     Consequently,  community  workers  have  an  important  role  in  bridging  the  Chinese   community  and  health  services.  The  community  workers  did  have  encouraging  experiences  to   demonstrate  that  perhaps  over  time,  some  Chinese  are  willing  to  approach  or  overcome  this   cultural  barrier.  Participant  1003  has  a  waiting  list  for  her  workshops  every  year,  which  shows   that  there  is  interest  in  learning  more  about  mental  health.     Our  [Cantonese]  culture  is  quite  significantly  affected  by  the  Hong  Kong  culture.  In  Hong   Kong  right  now  the  people,  they're  more  willing  to  disclose  emotional  issues.  .  .  .  A  lot  of   the  people  are  willing  to  step  out  to  the  community  to  participate.  I  think  it's  so   encouraging  to  the  workers  when  we  see  there's  significant  changes  in  the  past  ten   years  that  people  are  more  willing  to  talk  about  this  topic.  [.  .  .]  I  think  that's  a  long  term   battle.  It's  not  just  one  time  thing  that  suddenly  they  will  change  because  I  think  our   culture  and  the  mass  media  influence,  it's  difficult  to  change  the  concept  about   themselves  (Participant  1003).     Both  community  worker  participants  also  mentioned  other  activities  that  their   organizations  coordinate  for  their  clients:  arts  and  crafts,  lion  dance,  community  gardening,

Qigong  (Chinese  exercise),  cultural  events  (i.e.,  Chinese  New  Year),  and  community  walks.   These  activities  help  support  mental  health  for  Chinese  clients  through  methods  of  social   support,  engaging  clients  in  activities  that  they  might  enjoy,  and  for  them  to  live  independently.   For  those  that  require  more  assistance  after  workshops  or  group  activities,  clients  are  referred   to  an  intake  worker  or  social  worker  to  provide  personalized  assistance.        There  is  more  work  to  be  done  in  bringing  mental  health  awareness  to  the  Chinese  

community.  Yet  not  all  areas  of  Toronto  or  all  Chinese  may  be  able  to  access  these  services.  The   next  section  will  examine  the  availability  of  health  services  to  Chinese  in  Toronto.   3.3.2.2 Health  Services  for  Chinese      The  interviews  with  community  workers  covered  what  health  programs  and  services  are  

currently  available  specifically  for  the  Chinese  population.  Participant  1005's  organization   integrates  their  health  programs  with  neighbourhood  community  development.    There  are  less   concentrated  programs  for  the  Chinese  population,  however  her  work  covers  a  variety  of   Chinese  groups.  Her  previous  outreach  work  at  another  organization  was  not  just  for  Chinese,   but  she  tried  to  bring  more  health  awareness  to  the  Chinese  community.  She  would  hold   workshops  or  go  to  the  media  to  talk  about  health  issues  and  health  risks  for  Chinese   immigrants.        Participant  1003  focuses  on  prevention  and  promotion  of  mental  health  among  the  

Chinese  community.  Her  organization  tries  to  bridge  gaps  between  mainstream  mental  health   organizations  and  Asian  communities.  "I  just  got  the  community  requests  that  they  want  to   register  for  a  course,  because  not  so  many  organizations  that  will  organize  these  mental  health   workshops  to  the  clients  or  to  the  general  public"  (Participant  1003).  These  workshops  help  

   48  

bring  more  awareness  so  her  clients  can  think  about  whether  "they  maybe  have  some  of  the   mental  health  issues  and  then  they  will  seek  help  in  advance.  That's  our  purpose,  earlier   identification  and  early  treatment  as  possible"  (Participant  1003).        More  solutions  for  families  with  a  member  requiring  mental  health  support  are  needed  

though.  The  Ontario  Mental  Health  Act  (1990)  allows  physicians,  police  officers,  and  judges  to   commission  an  involuntary  admission  for  a  mental  health  assessment.  For  community  workers   like  Participant  1003,  they  can  advise  the  family  member  to  go  to  the  family  doctor  to  complete   a  form,  or  to  call  to  get  the  form  and  force  the  client  to  go  to  a  hospital  to  seek  help  for   treatment.  Yet  as  mentioned  in  the  Mental  Health  subsection,  many  family  members  do  not   want  to  violate  this  relationship.     It's  difficult  because  in  Canada,  they  have  some  policy  to  guide  us.  We  can't  force   people,  if  they  are  unwilling  to  seek  help,  then  it's  difficult  to  do  outreach.  That's  why   most  of  the  time  there  are  family  members  to  seek  help,  they  suspect  that  their  family   member  with  mental  health  concerns  (Participant  1003).        The  waiting  lists  for  her  workshops  and  the  numerous  partnerships  with  other  

organizations  could  mean  that  there  is  an  unmet  need  for  culturally  competent  mental  health   services  or  workshops.  "I  always  am  invited  by  different  organizations  to  provide  community   workshops.  For  example,  CareFirst  and  another  organization,  wellness  centres.  We  have  a  good   partnership,  relationship  with  other  community  organizations  including  social  organizations  and   churches  and  other  religion  organizations"  (Participant  1003).  The  community  worker   participants  also  gave  limited  responses  about  other  organizations  in  Toronto  that  perform   similar  work.  

   49  

The  geographic  location  of  the  organizations  will  also  play  a  role  in  accessibility  for   clients  that  often  favour  services  in  close  proximity.  So  while  Participant  1003  and  1005  provide   needed  mental  health  and  physical  health  services  respectively  for  their  service  location,  do   other  Chinese  also  need  these  services  but  are  unable  to  access  them?  It  is  difficult  to  provide   culturally-specific  physical  health  or  mental  health  services  independently  in  a  multicultural  city   like  Toronto,  so  how  can  more  organizations  or  service  providers  become  culturally  competent?   An  increase  in  culturally  competent  physical  health  or  mental  health  services  would  depend  on   funding,  which  will  be  addressed  in  the  next  section.     3.3.2.3 Participant  Recommendations  and  Government  Funding     The  issue  of  government  funding  depends  on  the  level  of  government  and  the   organization  or  services  that  are  under  that  government's  jurisdiction.  There  were  a  number  of   instances  in  the  interviews  when  the  participants  raised  the  theme  of  additional  government   funding  or  improvements.  To  start  with,  LINC  English  classes  could  use  more  funding,  which  is   funded  by  the  federal  government.    Participant  1001  remembered  when  there  was  funding   available  for  their  LINC  English  classes  to  visit  other  parts  of  the  city  to  help  learn  more  about   Canada  and  Canadians.  She  wished  that  more  funding  was  available  so  that  they  could  know   more  about  Toronto  and  Canada  through  their  LINC  English  classes.  Participant  1002  thought   that  the  teaching  in  LINC  English  classes  could  be  improved.  She  heard  that  there  are  some   people  who  take  the  classes  for  a  long  time  without  improvement  in  their  English.   LINC  English  classes  also  do  not  teach  basic  medical  terms  that  might  be  helpful  to  put   new  immigrants  at  ease  with  interacting  with  the  Canadian  healthcare  system.  Instead,   Participant  1005  had  one  session  to  teach  older  Chinese  adults  about  words  that  they  might  

   50  

come  across  in  the  healthcare  system  so  that  they  know  for  themselves  whether  it  was  right  or   that  their  issues  were  addressed.  Perhaps  this  would  be  a  useful  class  for  all  new  immigrants  to   have  so  that  they  are  equipped  with  essential  knowledge  for  accessing  Canadian  healthcare.   The  provincial  government  is  responsible  for  funding  healthcare  in  each  province.  The   participants  mentioned  a  few  areas  of  healthcare  that  could  use  extra  funding.  Participant  1001   would  like  to  have  test  results  for  medical  tests  that  are  required  for  older  adults  to  be  given  to   the  patients  for  free.  Her  thoughts  were  that  this  would  allow  patients  to  track  their  own  health   and  would  save  the  government  money  since  this  could  prevent  certain  illnesses.  She  also   thought  that  the  government  could  be  looking  more  closely  at  preventative  medicine.     Therefore,  I  suggested  the  "Preventive  Medical  Care"  for  the  government.  There  was  a   saying:  "Prevention  is  better  than  cure  ".  It  would  save  a  lot  of  money  so  I  don't  need  to   see  the  doctor  as  often.  There  would  be  no  surgery  needed  and  [they]  can  offer  a   nutrition  class  (Participant  1001).   Both  Cantonese-speaking  women  would  also  like  Chinese  herbalists  or  TCM  doctors  to   be  covered,  however  there  would  need  to  be  lobbying  efforts  for  governments  to  accept  TCM   and  acupuncturists  in  provincial  medical  plans.  British  Columbia  is  the  only  province  to  allow   acupuncture  treatments  to  be  covered  for  premium  assistance  recipients  since  2008  (British   Columbia  Ministry  of  Health,  2008).  Ontario  officially  required  all  acupuncture  practitioners  to   be  registered  in  April  2013,  while  they  regulated  TCM  practitioners  since  2006  (Ontario  Ministry   of  Health,  2013).        One  community  worker  wished  that  she  could  have  another  caseworker  to  effectively

don't  have  much  time  to  follow  up.  So  I  feel  sad  about  that.  .  .  .  I  would  love  to  have  another   person  to  help  me.  I'm  the  only  person  here  working  on  this"  (Participant  1005).  The  lack  of   personnel  also  meant  that  potential  solutions  could  not  be  implemented  to  tackle  issues  like   older  adults'  social  isolation  in  the  winter.     One  way  we  could  do  is  friendly  visiting  programming,  but  it's  hard  to  do  that.  I  don't   have  the  manpower  for  that.  Or  a  peer  support  system.  .  .  .  Some  of  the  seniors'   language  issues,  that's  still  there.  That  hinders  the  whole  process  (Participant  1005).   As  for  mental  health  services,  the  community  worker  thought  that  partnerships  would   improve  accessibility  for  Chinese  clients  and  provide  improved  services  for  them.     For  me,  I  would  have  a  partnership  with  different  social  organizations.  We  would  be   active  to  involve  the  community  to  let  them  have  some  kind  of  opportunity  to  access   the  services.  Right  now,  you  can  see  that  they  have  different  organizations  to  still   provide  mental  health  issues  or  another  [for]  physical  health,  then  there's  one  of   different  entry  points,  they  can  still  seek  help  (Participant  1003).     Both  Cantonese-speaking  women  also  noted  the  long  wait  times  for  doctors  and  felt   that  this  should  be  improved.  Wait  times  are  a  major  issue  in  Canadian  healthcare,  however   practical  solutions  are  yet  to  be  found  (Canadian  Health  Coalition,  2015a).     The  systemic  barriers  covered  a  variety  of  themes  that  could  influence  access  to   healthcare  services  that  the  Cantonese-speaking  older  immigrant  women  could  not  control.   Community  workers  also  added  evidence  to  themes  that  they  experienced  or  that  were   mentioned  by  their  Chinese  clientele.  Intersections  of  systemic  barriers,  post-migration   challenges  and  social  categories  are  discussed  in  the  next  chapter.

4. Discussion  
   From  an  intersectional  framework,  the  interactions  between  themes  should  be  

examined  for  their  affect  on  health,  along  with  the  social  and  historical  context.  Four  major   intersections  are  discussed:  family  issues  with  other  post-migration  challenges,  Chinese  culture   and  health  beliefs  with  Canadian  culture  and  health  beliefs,  immigration  experiences  with  social   categories,  and  government  funding  for  the  healthcare  system  with  culture.  Limitations  and   future  directions  of  this  research  study  are  also  discussed  in  this  chapter.  

4.1 Intersecting  Family  Issues  with  other  Post-migration  Challenges  
One  major  subtheme  that  intersected  with  other  subthemes  was  about  family  issues.   Family  can  be  a  major  reason  that  older  Chinese  people  immigrate  to  Canada  (Preston,   Kobayashi  &  Siemiatycki,  2006).  There  are  expectations  that  older  Chinese  adults  will  help  with   family  duties  such  as  caring  for  grandchildren,  and  other  family  business,  household  or  care   work  as  a  result  of  being  sponsored  for  immigration  (Lam,  1994).  However,  parents  of  adult   children  may  not  live  with  them  to  avoid  conflict  over  family  roles  (Kramer  et  al.,  2002).   In  the  case  of  Participant  1002,  immigration  partially  led  to  the  separation  of  spouses.   There  is  concern  for  the  health  of  family  class  immigrants  because  under  the  family   reunification  policy,  sponsors  are  financially  responsible  for  their  relative  for  10  years  (or  20   years  for  2014  applicants;  CIC,  2014),  thus  family  class  immigrants  are  not  eligible  for  publicly   funded  programs  such  as  hospitalization  and  home  care  (Chard,  Badets  &  Howatson,  2000;   Simmons,  1990).  Therefore,  socioeconomic  status  is  another  intersecting  subtheme  with  family   issues.  Although  the  Cantonese-speaking  women  in  this  study  did  not  explicitly  say  that   finances  affected  their  access  to  healthcare,  they  were  concerned  about  certain  costs      53  

surrounding  their  health.  Another  study  also  found  that  Chinese  immigrant  women  who  were   dependent  on  their  children  financially  would  determine  their  utilization  of  the  healthcare   system  from  this  situation  (Wang,  1997).     Family  issues  also  intersect  with  learning  a  new  language  because  if  there  is  a  family   member  available  to  translate  during  medical  appointments,  then  the  need  for  older  Chinese   immigrant  adults  to  learn  a  new  language  could  be  mitigated.  Translation  services  through   family  members  did  not  occur  for  the  Cantonese-speaking  women,  but  the  community  workers   mentioned  that  this  occurs  in  some  families.  There  is  also  work  to  be  done  with  creating  trust   with  older  adults  and  interpreters,  whether  it  is  a  family  member  or  a  health  services  provider.   Participant  1005  revealed  that  older  Chinese  immigrant  adults  that  did  not  speak  English  felt   fear  or  distrust  in  those  situations.  "It's  uncertainty  too  that  makes  them  tense.  Language  of   course,  you  don't  have  skill,  you  don't  know  then  you  certainly  feel  unsafe"  (Participant  1005).   She  tried  to  lessen  their  fear  and  distrust  through  a  session  about  common  English  medical   terms,  however  it  is  unknown  if  there  are  many  others  that  provide  this  information  to  older   Chinese  immigrant  adults.  In  another  study,  the  Chinese  immigrant  women  felt  demoralized   and  embarrassed  over  family  dependence  for  translation  services  (Wang,  1997).  The   dependence  on  family  members  can  also  leave  older  Chinese  immigrant  adults  to  be  socially   isolated  from  their  peers  or  Canadian  society.  Their  strong  words  to  Participant  1005  describing   their  situation  as  an  "overseas  prison"  should  not  be  taken  lightly.  As  such,  social  isolation  for   older  adults  also  intersects  with  family  issues.        From  the  intersecting  subthemes  mentioned  above,  the  importance  of  family  well-being  

to  support  older  Chinese  immigrant  adults'  integration  has  been  neglected  in  research  so  far.

The  power  of  the  sponsor  over  the  parents  or  grandparents  is  a  reversal  of  Chinese  cultural   norms  based  on  the  respect  of  elders  and  filial  piety,  a  Confucian  moral  tradition  that  adult   children  take  good  care  of  their  aged  parents  (Wang,  1998).  Older  Chinese  immigrant  adults  are   dependent  on  their  adult  children  for  their  social  integration  and  economic  security  (CAC,   2008).  Yet  based  on  the  evidence  from  other  sections  in  this  paper  regarding  cultural  norms,   older  Chinese  immigrant  adults  are  unlikely  to  disclose  even  more  serious  family  issues  like   elder  abuse  or  intimate  partner  violence.  Community  workers  already  raised  the  issue  of   intergenerational  conflict  within  families,  which  could  be  more  widespread  than  reported  due   to  cultural  norms  that  prevent  disclosure.     The  combination  of  the  stresses  of  family  integration,  immigration  policies  that  require   10-20  years  of  sponsorship,  and  other  policies  that  do  not  recognize  older  adult  immigrants'   contributions  could  lead  families  to  take  out  their  frustration  on  their  older  adult  family   member.  Older  adult  immigrants  who  are  sponsored  by  family  are  in  vulnerable  situations  -   they  don't  want  to  break  the  family  apart  when  conflict  or  abuse  occurs,  they  don't  qualify  for   social  assistance,  and  they  face  integration  issues  with  Canadian  society.  The  families  have   limited  solutions  outside  of  the  constraints  of  Canadian  immigration  policy.  Perhaps  this   requires  recognition  on  the  part  of  Canadian  and  ethnic  communities  about  this  gap  in  the   immigration  system  to  provide  more  support  or  services  for  older  adult  immigrants  and  to   advocate  for  policy  changes.

4.2 Intersecting  Chinese  Culture  and  Health  Beliefs  with  Canadian  Culture  and   Health  Beliefs  
   Intersectionality  is  especially  relevant  to  capture  the  diversity  of  the  human  experience  

for  those  who  do  not  fit  neatly  into  one  homogeneous  cultural  group.  Third  culture  kids  (a  child   born  in  a  third  country  whose  parents  are  from  two  different  cultures;  Tokuhama-Espinosa,   2003),  immigrants  adapting  to  a  new  country,  or  children  of  immigrants  are  faced  with   examining  multiple  cultural  values  and  identities  as  part  of  acculturation  (Heine,  2012).  Perhaps   depending  on  the  context,  elements  of  more  than  one  culture  are  adopted  as  a  form  of   blending  (a  mix  of  two  cultures;  Heine,  2012),  code-switching  (contextual  public  presentation  of   the  self;  Anderson,  1998)  or  frame-switching  (psychological  switching  between  cultural  selves;   Heine,  2012).        The  two  main  cultures  in  this  paper  are  Canadian  and  Chinese.  One  major  difference  

concerns  health  beliefs,  another  concerns  mental  health,  while  the  other  major  difference  is   about  cultural  values.  First  I  will  address  health  beliefs.  Some  may  expect  that  Chinese   immigrants  should  just  adopt  the  Western  medical  approach  upon  immigration.  However  that   view  is  ignorant  of  the  history  of  Chinese  medicine  that  dates  back  at  least  two  thousand  years   (National  Center  for  Complementary  and  Integrative  Health,  2013).  There  are  great  efforts   underway  to  produce  more  evidence-based  research  about  the  effectiveness  of  Chinese   medicine  (Yeung,  2006).    In  China,  TCM  and  Western  medicine  are  integrated  and  there  are   studies  that  may  eventually  lead  to  a  combination  of  the  two  systems  (Tang,  Liu  &  Ma,  2008).   Perhaps  part  of  the  attraction  to  TCM  is  that  it  uses  a  natural  and  holistic  approach  in   responding  to  disease  treatment  and  it  does  care  about  a  person's  well-being  (Yeung,  2006).  

   56  

The  Western  medical  model  that  involves  pills,  doctors  that  may  not  fully  investigate  a  medical   problem,  and  waiting  until  symptoms  develop  does  not  sit  well  with  those  who  experienced   TCM,  such  as  the  Cantonese-speaking  women  in  this  study.  While  the  women  do  not  choose   one  approach  over  another,  the  Western  medical  model  does  not  always  allow  for  other  health   beliefs  to  be  considered  (Fadiman,  1997).  Therefore,  TCM  should  be  considered  with  Western   medicine  as  more  studies  show  increasing  use  among  all  Canadians  of  complementary  and   alternative  medicines  (Quan  et  al.,  2008).      Due  to  the  holistic  nature  of  TCM,  psychology  and  mental  health  remains  a  foreign  

concept  for  many  Chinese  immigrants.  The  area  of  psychology  requires  further  evidence  that   Euro-American  based  psychological  terms  apply  to  other  populations  in  the  world  (Henrich,   Heine  &  Norenzayan,  2010;  Marsella  &  Pedersen,  2004).  Consequently,  the  approach  that  was   adopted  by  the  community  workers  in  this  research  study  that  adapted  Western  mental  health   terms  to  be  approachable  for  Chinese  immigrants  needs  to  be  integrated  into  the  Canadian   mental  health  practice.  These  adaptations  may  prove  to  be  useful  for  other  ethnic  groups  as   well.  In  addition,  cultural  competence  surrounding  the  usefulness  of  asking  about  a  person's   social  context  should  be  considered,  given  the  evidence  in  the  context  surrounding  Participant   1002's  mental  health.  Other  approaches  that  are  mindful  about  limited  help-seeking  behaviours   or  limited  discussion  of  personal  problems  are  also  needed  for  Chinese  immigrant  clients.        A  number  of  differing  cultural  values  between  Chinese  immigrants  and  Canadians  were  

evident  in  this  paper.  It  cannot  be  expected  that  Chinese  immigrants  will  give  up  on  all  of  their   cultural  values  upon  arrival  in  Canada.  Some  adapt  to  their  situation  in  Canada  by  relieving  their   children  of  the  filial  piety  expectation  (Lam,  1994).  Some  try  to  save  face  through  avoiding  

   57  

conflicts  with  their  family  members,  such  as  the  participants  of  this  research  study.  Other   Chinese  immigrants  avoid  topics  like  death  even  though  they  have  lived  in  Canada  for  decades,   which  Participant  1005  experienced  at  a  wills  and  estates  session.  The  cultural  values  need  to   be  kept  in  mind  when  providing  or  adapting  community  or  health  services  to  Chinese  clients.  It   may  also  be  useful  for  community  workers  like  Participant  1003  and  Participant  1005  to   develop  or  become  part  of  a  network  of  Chinese  service  providers  to  share  information  about   client  patterns  or  develop  initiatives.  

4.3 Intersecting  Immigration  Experiences  with  Social  Categories  
   This  section  aims  to  examine  intersecting  social  categories  of  gender,  ethnicity,  and  age  

for  Cantonese-speaking  older  immigrant  women.  The  Cantonese-speaking  women  did  not   explicitly  mention  gender  issues  that  they  faced  after  immigration  to  Canada.  In  fact,   Participant  1001's  work  and  English  levels  in  comparison  to  her  husband's  situation  differs  from   the  usual  account  of  immigrant  men  that  work  and  have  better  English  levels.  Community   workers  noted  that  their  clientele  consisted  mainly  of  Chinese  women  participating  in  their   sessions  or  activities,  however  both  were  encouraging  Chinese  men  to  become  more  involved.        The  Cantonese-speaking  women  participants  noted  circumstances  surrounding  their  

own  age  in  the  interviews.  Participant  1001  thought  that  it  was  generous  of  the  government  to   provide  language  classes  to  older  adult  immigrants.  Participant  1002  wanted  to  volunteer  or   work  but  found  ageism  instead.     When  they  have  seen  me  in  motion  personally  doing  the  manual  labour  for  an  aging   woman,  they  asked  me  not  to  do  them.  They  think  that  I  am  too  old  for  manual  labour.   [.  .  .]  When  I  faced  the  interviewer,  his  comment  was  "Why  are  you  not  retired?"  I  was  

   58  

so  discouraged  by  the  prejudice  towards  aging  older  adults  (Participant  1002).     The  community  worker  that  works  regularly  with  older  adult  groups  highlighted  that  older   Chinese  women  are  very  active.  "Chinese  women  are  very  active,  they  will  do  all  kinds  of  things,   they  do  the  dancing  group,  they're  singing,  the  folk  dance,  then  summertime  they  try  to  do   gardening"  (Participant  1005).  Therefore,  the  ageism  towards  older  Chinese  women  is   unwarranted  since  they  prefer  to  be  active.        Participant  1001  did  not  mention  any  acts  of  discrimination  towards  her  because  of  her  

ethnicity.  Participant  1002  noted  experiencing  discrimination  because  of  prejudice  towards   Asian  people.  The  community  workers  also  did  not  hear  about  experiences  of  discrimination   towards  their  clients.  Yet  Participant  1003  stated  that  systemic  barriers  exist  for  those  who   cannot  speak  the  official  languages  in  Canada  for  accessing  healthcare.  These  systemic  barriers   also  exist  within  the  Canadian  immigration  system,  which  intersects  with  the  social  categories   of  participants  in  this  research  study.  The  systemic  barriers  are  invisible  until  we  examine  the   social  and  historical  context  of  immigration  in  Canada.     The  social  context  of  gender  is  relevant  for  many  Chinese  immigrant  women.  Many   studies  have  explored  the  systemic  structure  of  patriarchy  or  gender  inequalities  that  oppresses   Chinese  immigrant  women  (Fong,  1999;  Ho,  2006;  Man,  1997;  Man,  2004;  Poy,  2013;  Preston  &   Man,  1999).  While  gender  was  not  a  central  issue  in  this  research  study,  it  is  noted  that  other   research  exists  in  which  Chinese  women  felt  the  double  burden  of  being  racialized  as  an  ethnic   minority  and  of  being  a  woman  in  Canada  (CCNC,  1992;  Poy,  2013).  Issues  surrounding  gender   will  be  further  explored  in  the  next  section.   Race  continues  to  exist  as  a  sociological  term  that  incorrectly  describes  physical

attributes  of  ethnicity.  Racism  influenced  the  Canadian  immigration  system  until  the  1960s   when  the  points  system  was  introduced  (Dua,  2000).    The  view  of  Chinese  people  in  the  19th   century  was  based  on  a  European  hierarchy  of  race  that  justified  viewing  others  as  inferior   (Pieterse,  2002).  Canadian  nation-building  favoured  Anglo-Saxon  immigration  and  social   organization,  not  the  increase  of  racialized  immigrants  until  after  World  War  II  (Dua,  2000).     The  notion  that  racialized  women  would  disrupt  British  nation-building  through  the   creation  of  communities  resulted  in  the  exclusion  of  Chinese  women  until  1950  (Dua,  2000;   Poy,  2013).  Although  federal  policies  aimed  to  promote  equality  in  employment  for  visible   minorities  and  women,  systemic  discrimination  continued  for  the  more  educated  wave  of   Chinese  women  from  Hong  Kong  (Poy,  2013;  Public  Service  Alliance  of  Canada,  2013).  Anti- Chinese  sentiments  existed  in  Toronto  and  Vancouver  throughout  the  late  1980s  and  early   1990s  from  those  that  resented  the  success  and  power  of  non-European  immigrants  and   cultural  communities  (Poy,  2013).  Foreign  property  owners,  many  of  whom  are  Chinese,  remain   an  issue  in  Vancouver  and  Toronto  due  to  the  high  costs  of  renting  or  buying  property  in  the   cities  (CBC  News,  2015).  As  a  result,  some  Chinese  women  that  migrate  to  Canada  may  not  be   aware  of  their  social  location  in  Canadian  society  in  which  they  are  racialized  and  Chinese.   Ageism  derives  from  ageist  attitudes,  which  are  thought  to  be  composed  of  feelings  due   to  a  person's  age,  stereotypes  about  what  someone  is  like  because  the  person  is  of  a  certain   age,  and  differential  treatment  due  to  their  older  age  (Kite  &  Wagner,  2004).  There  remains  a   gap  in  health  knowledge  due  to  the  limited  studies  on  older  persons,  including  international   studies  that  do  not  gather  statistics  on  people  over  the  age  of  50  (Canadian  Women's  Health   Network,  2012).  A  Canadian  medical  student  also  lamented  about  the  amount  of  ageism  

   60  

embedded  into  the  structure  of  their  curriculum  and  training  (Stall,  2012).  It  is  not  a  surprise   then  that  health  studies  on  older  women  are  limited,  and  even  more  so  for  older  immigrant   women.  Older  immigrant  women  may  also  be  described  as  having  a  "triple  jeopardy":    age,   gender,  and  ethnicity  (Chundamala,  Matsuo  &  Peng,  2006).  Meanwhile,  more  attention  should   be  paid  to  older  immigrant  women  since  they  are  more  vulnerable  and  dependent  than  non- immigrants  when  adjusting  to  a  new  environment  (Chundamala,  Matsuo  &  Peng,  2006;  Mehr,   2013).  It  is  especially  important  for  older  immigrant  women  since  the  social  context  can  affect  a   person's  psychological  adjustment  to  their  new  country  (Chen,  2010;  Lou  &  Beaujot,  2005;   Tang,  Oatley  &  Toner,  2007).      Racism,  patriarchy,  and  ageism  are  systems  of  oppression  that  can  negatively  impact  

older  Chinese  immigrant  women  in  Canada.  Although  these  systems  may  not  apply  to  all  older   Chinese  immigrant  women,  the  fact  that  this  is  the  case  for  some  Chinese  and  other  immigrant   women  requires  that  more  recognition  of  a  triple  burden  is  needed.  As  a  result,  a  multi-faceted   approach  to  eliminating  these  systemic  barriers  is  needed,  especially  as  the  number  of  older   immigrant  adults  grows  in  major  cities  across  Canada  due  to  an  aging  population.  

4.4 Intersecting  Government  Funding  for  the  Healthcare  System  with  Culture  
   The  Canadian  healthcare  system  was  designed  for  all  residents  to  have  access  to  

prepaid,  medically  necessary  hospital  and  physician  services  (Health  Canada,  2010).  The  federal   agency,  Health  Canada  has  a  mandate  to  implement  the  Canada  Health  Act  (1985),  which  is  the   federal  law  that  sets  the  criteria  and  conditions  for  provincially  insured  health  services  and   extended  health  services  to  receive  federal  cash  contributions.    The  organization  of  healthcare  

   61  

delivery  services  is  based  on  the  ideology  of  self-care  (Anderson,  Blue  &  Lau,  1991;  Health   Canada,  2002).      Self-care  is  linked  to  other  Western  ideologies:  individualism,  neoliberalism  and  

capitalism.  The  neoliberal  ideology  is  based  on  the  notion  that  each  human  being  should  be   free  to  pursue  happiness  without  government  interference  and  be  personally  responsible  for   their  welfare  without  government  aid  (Finn,  2007).  Among  government  policies,  neoliberalism   places  an  emphasis  on  individualism  and  market-led  economic  and  social  restructuring   (Whiteside,  2009).  Individualism  places  the  responsibility  upon  oneself,  and  not  embedded  in   other  social  structures.  Capitalism  thrives  from  individual  actions  for  the  pursuit  of  profit  (Marx   &  McLennan,  2000).     Neoliberal  policies  have  become  problematic  for  public  healthcare  (medicare)  in   Canada.  The  door  has  being  left  open  for  the  erosion  of  socialized  medicine  due  to  the  federal   and  provincial  governments'  preference  to  privatize  elements  of  healthcare  (Whiteside,  2009).   The  federal  government  has  continuously  decreased  healthcare  funding  while  healthcare  costs   increased  since  1977,  including  the  latest  cut  of  $36  billion  over  the  next  10  years  beginning  in   2017  (Canadian  Health  Coalition,  2015b;  Whiteside,  2009).  The  provinces  turned  to  public- private  partnerships  and  the  privatization  of  health  support  services  in  attempts  to  fix  the   funding  shortfall,  which  commodified  the  future  development  of  healthcare  (Whiteside,  2009).   Yet  the  healthcare  system's  quality  becomes  undermined  when  profitability  is  more  important   than  providing  necessary  services  and  places  the  onus  on  individuals.     The  expectation  of  self-care  or  individual  responsibility  for  healthcare  will  not  help   immigrant  women  if  resources  to  enable  them  to  do  so  are  not  in  place  (Anderson,  Blue  &  Lau,  

   62  

1991).  For  example  in  this  research  study,  Participant  1001  would  like  to  track  her  own  health   but  currently  medical  test  results  are  not  automatically  provided  to  a  patient.    There  are  also   fewer  resources  available  for  Chinese  women  who  may  require  translators,  social  workers,  or   respite  services  in  a  city  like  Edmonton  (Stewart  et  al.,  2006).    The  Canadian  healthcare  system   also  marginalizes  older  adult  immigrants  who  do  not  conform  to  what  is  provided  by  the   Western  health  model.  There  are  no  provisions  to  provide  non-Western  food  to  patients  in   hospitals,  or  for  nurses  to  speak  to  patients  in  their  language  (Leung  &  McDonald,  2001).     Some  progressive  elements  are  adopting  the  cultural  competence  approach  in  which   healthcare  professionals  acknowledge  and  respect  cultures  and  cultural  practices  of  their   clients,  and  develop  awareness  of  their  own  cultural  values  and  beliefs  that  shape  interactions   with  their  clients  (Canadian  Medical  Protective  Association,  2014;  Fadiman,  1997;  Gustafson,   2008;  Leininger,  1996).  However  this  approach  has  not  been  adopted  as  part  of  national  health   policy,  so  there  are  varied  practices  across  Canada,  with  only  Alberta  and  Nova  Scotia  creating   guides  available  regarding  cultural  competence  for  all  medical  service  professionals  (Alberta   Health  Services,  2009;  Nova  Scotia  Department  of  Health,  2005).  The  inability  of  the  neoliberal   state  to  fund  linguistically  and  culturally  sensitive  services  places  the  onus  on  family  members   or  community  organizations  to  provide  these  services  (Brotman,  2003;  Stewart  et  al.,  2006).   Language  as  a  barrier  to  health  services  is  also  a  form  of  discrimination,  however  it  can  easily  be   seen  as  an  individual  rather  than  a  systemic  problem  (Brotman,  2003).  In  fact,  the  invisibility  of   institutional  racism  surrounding  the  language  barrier  in  health  services  does  not  make  the  issue   easily  addressed  (Brotman,  2003).  Nevertheless,  more  progressive  health  policies  will  not  likely   be  implemented  if  provincial  health  systems  are  constantly  battling  for  funds  from  the  federal  

   63  

and  provincial  governments.      The  Canadian  medical  system  tends  to  have  a  patriarchal  approach.  The  hierarchy  in  the  

medical  system  is  related  to  political  power  since  the  time  of  inception  of  male  professional   associations  of  doctors  that  influenced  decision-makers  (Valiani,  2011).  The  current  biomedical   model  for  doctors  is  based  on  treatments,  diagnoses,  and  seeing  body  parts  as  separate,  as   opposed  to  an  approach  taught  to  nurses,  which  involves  caring  for  the  whole  person  (Valiani,   2011).  In  another  study,  some  Chinese  immigrant  women  described  this  hierarchy  in  the   Canadian  healthcare  system  as  "a  doctor  is  an  empire"  (Wang,  1997).  For  this  study,  how  is  it   that  despite  having  Cantonese-speaking  doctors,  some  of  the  Cantonese-speaking  women's   medical  issues  remained  untreated?  It  is  unknown  if  gender  was  an  issue,  but  it  is  noted  that   both  women  in  this  study  had  male  Chinese  doctors  that  refused  to  investigate  their  medical   issues  further.  A  preference  for  a  more  holistic  approach  to  medical  treatment  due  to  increases   in  immigrant  populations  in  Canada  may  not  support  the  continued  Western  biomedical  model.       Evidence  towards  differences  in  Canadian  immigrant  health  compared  to  the  Canadian-born   population  requires  different  strategies  (Hyman,  2007;  Lai,  2004;  Lou  &  Beaujot,  2005;  Oxman- Martinez  et  al.,  2005)  that  may  include  alternative  treatments  (Quan  et  al.,  2008).     There  is  a  gap  in  national  health  policy  discussions  regarding  concerns  specific  to   immigrant  populations  (Asanin  &  Wilson,  2008).  The  most  recent  national  health  commissions,   the  Commission  on  the  Future  of  Healthcare  in  Canada  (Romanow,  2002)  and  the  Standing   Senate  Committee  on  Social  Affairs,  Science  and  Technology  Study  on  the  State  of  the   Healthcare  System  in  Canada  (Kirby  &  LeBreton,  2002),  did  not  give  adequate  consideration  to   the  health  needs  of  immigrant  populations  in  the  concerns  or  recommendations  from  the  

   64  

discussions  (Asanin  &  Wilson,  2008).    It  was  argued  that  current  immigrant  health  practices  and   policies  were  found  in  the  Immigration  and  Refugee  Protection  Act  (2001)  rather  than  in   national  health  legislation  (Gushulak  &  Williams,  2004).  As  such,  the  Canadian  healthcare   system  needs  to  address  the  needs  of  a  growing  immigrant  population  and  ensure  access  is   available  to  all.  

4.5 Limitations  and  Future  Research     
   This  research  study  has  a  few  limitations.  First,  the  experiences  with  healthcare  services  

of  the  Cantonese-speaking  women  are  contextual  to  Toronto,  which  has  a  large  Cantonese- speaking  Chinese  population.  Cantonese-speaking  women  in  other  Canadian  cities  with  lower   proportions  of  Cantonese-speaking  people  may  have  a  different  healthcare  experience.  Second,   it  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  progressive  nature  of  intersectionality  means  that   currently  there  are  limited  studies  to  compare  methodology  with,  and  that  the  focus  on   heterogeneity  may  make  it  difficult  to  unify  efforts  to  address  inequalities  (Hankivsky  et  al.,   2010).  Third,  since  few  community  workers  specifically  work  with  older  Cantonese-speaking   immigrant  women  then  this  group's  specific  issues  are  hard  to  pinpoint.  However,  there  is   evidence  of  their  issues  from  this  study.  Fourth,  due  to  limited  space  I  cannot  include  other   topics  in  this  MRP  that  were  discussed  in  the  interviews  that  deserve  to  be  publicized  (i.e.,   positive  post-migration  changes,  differences  between  the  Chinese  and  Canadian  healthcare   systems,  current  experiences  of  Mandarin-speaking  young  mothers).  Fifth,  due  to  a  limited   research  period  then  the  number  of  Cantonese-speaking  women  was  fewer  than  anticipated.   More  women  could  provide  other  areas  of  difference  that  were  not  identified  in  this  study.      Future  directions  for  this  study  could  include  increasing  efforts  to  build  partnerships  

   65  

with  community  organizations  to  benefit  the  Chinese  or  local  community.  A  community-based   approach  could  be  used  to  explore  different  needs  of  Chinese  immigrant  women  in  different   areas  of  Toronto  or  across  Canada.  The  study  could  be  expanded  to  include  Cantonese-speaking   health  professionals  and  their  experiences  with  their  Chinese  clientele.  Also,  other  studies  were   successful  with  random  telephone  surveys  with  Chinese  households,  which  may  be  another   recruitment  technique  to  be  used.  

5. Conclusion  
The  richness  of  qualitative  research  is  evident  in  the  interviews  of  this  research  study.   There  is  a  lot  to  be  learned  from  a  research  study  involving  non-English-speaking  participants  ­   from  the  translations  involved  to  the  practical  limitations  regarding  a  university  telephone   system  to  the  descriptions  of  implicit  cultural  terms,  I  learned  a  lot  through  the  whole  process.     Through  this  research  study  I  gained  cultural  knowledge  that  enriches  my  own  cultural  identity.   I  hope  that  this  research  will  also  help  improve  the  experiences  of  older  Chinese  immigrants.     The  perceptions  of  health  for  these  Cantonese-speaking  women  were  centered  around   a  holistic  approach  to  health  and  echoed  some  of  the  beliefs  of  Traditional  Chinese  Medicine.     Their  health  experiences  varied  even  though  they  often  encountered  Cantonese-speaking   health  professionals.  Language  did  not  prevent  them  from  accessing  healthcare  services,  but   did  cause  them  anxiety  about  receiving  proper  medical  attention.  Other  post-migration   challenges  and  systemic  barriers  contributed  to  the  health  experiences  of  these  Cantonese- speaking  women,  supplemented  by  the  observations  of  the  community  workers.     This  research  study  was  important  in  its  efforts  to  expand  research  knowledge  about  the   health  experiences  of  those  who  cannot  fluently  speak  an  official  language  in  Canada.  This  

   66  

study  also  highlights  the  voices  of  older  racialized  women  and  their  experiences  with  the   healthcare  system.  Their  perceptions  of  health  and  their  social  context  are  important  to   consider  for  those  who  work  in  the  health  services  sector.  The  intersectional  approach  tackled   the  intersections  in  social  categories,  post-migration  challenges,  and  the  numerous  structural   barriers  on  all  sides  of  the  health  system.     Such  variances  in  health  experiences  point  to  the  notion  that  all  of  the  social   determinants  of  health  should  be  considered.  Cultural  competence  among  health  professionals   should  be  a  minimum  standard  to  account  for  the  numerous  factors  that  can  affect  health.   Moreover,  it  should  be  advocated  that  the  Canadian  healthcare  system  should  be  adequately   funded  and  measures  should  be  taken  to  include  immigrant  health  issues  in  national  health   policies.  Otherwise,  immigrant  voices  will  once  again  be  marginalized  and  left  out  of  dominant   discourse.
