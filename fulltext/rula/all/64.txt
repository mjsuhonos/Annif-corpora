Steel Versus Stainless Steel in the Design of Electrode Arms for UHP Electric Arc Furnaces

Abstract-The operating temperatures due to eddy current induced heating effects in water-cooled electrode arms of three-phase ultrahigh powered (UHP) electric arc furnaces during operation are calculated. The selection of commonly used materials (carbon steel SAE 1010 and stainless steel - 304) is examined with regard to optimum cooling water flow and safe allowable temperature increases. Calculated results are substantiated by temperature measurements conducted on the center-phase electrode arm and its water cooling system of a recently installed furnace in the field.

INTRODUCTION D URING the last few years many arc furnaces have been upgraded for much higher production rates by replacing the furnace transformers, using larger diameter electrodes and modifying the secondary circuits from transformer to electrode clamps. Although significant benefits were derived from this, it also has created many problems concerning magnetically induced power losses due to eddy currents, causing overheating. With increases in electrode currents of 100 percent or more in the case of upgrading, as well as in the design of new ultrahigh powered (UHP) electric arc furnaces, significantly higher power input levels have been reached. This meant that extra precautions had to be taken, since the conventional furnaces were built for relatively small currents compared with UHP operations. Therefore, the electrode arms are exposed to much stronger magnetic fields than before and serious heating problems could result. In addition, restrictions on geometrical arrangements are imposed by the melPaper 1USD 80-15, approved by the Electric Process Heating Committee of the IEEE Industry Applications Society for publication in this TRANSACTIONS.

shop in their request for available height and space around a fumace, thereby limiting the spacing of conductors away from steel components. Often the problem was solved by using stainless steel instead of carbon steel electrode arms. Its negligible magnetic permeability and lower electrical conductivity inherently limits the eddy currents, hence the resulting heating effects. However, the penetration of the magnetic field at the prevailing frequency (60 Hz) is more complete in stainless steel. This means that although the heat generation is lower, it is fairly constant throughout the material. With carbon steel it is concentrated mainly in a thin layer, but it has a better thermal conductivity, which implies that any induced heat is extracted more readily by the coolant. Considering the electrical and thermal properties of the materials involved, it was not apparent that the use of stainless steel necessarily meant a satisfactory electrode arm operating temperature for a particular furnace design. In addition, due to the dramatic price increases of stainless steel as compared to carbon steel, the electrode arm production costs are considerably higher, thereby influencing furnace economy. To answer the basic question of material selection for a specific design and to isolate critical design parameters, as well as to aid in future furnace designs, this investigation was carried out. The electrode arm operating temperatures, during and under the most severe furnace conditions, were determined for a three-phase electric arc furnace design using these materials in the design of the electrode arms. Factors such as coolant flow and thickness of material were also considered. The particular furnace studied was recently upgraded to produce 4S0 000 tons of steel per year. Originally built with a 19-ft 0-in inside diameter (ID) shell having a standard refractory, 20-in (diameter) electrodes, and powered with a three(

phase 53 MVA furnace transformer was modified to a 20-ft 0-in ID shell with a water-cooled shell and roof, 24-in electrodes and supplied by a 93 MVA transformer. To accept the 24-in diameter electrodes and significantly larger electrical and mechanical loading, all furnace components (except rockers, furnace bottom, and platform) were redesigned and modified to meet the new design criteria. New electrode arms, bus bar designs, and the selection of electrode arm material was a prime consideration in view of the above mentioned concerns. The result of this study was a deciding factor in the material selection of the electrode arms and is subsequently presented. After presenting the theoretical results of this study, temperature measurements on the actual furnace center electrode arm and its water cooling system are included, verifying the theoretically predicted values on this UHP furnace, operating satisfactorily since midsummer 1979.

FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM The general assembly of the furnace investigated is illustrated in Fig. 1, showing the center electrode arm with the bus tubes and its support structure. There are three such electrode arms, one per phase, each in turn supported by an electrode mast (column) which is hydraulically operated to raise and lower the entire electrode arm assembly. The electrode arms support the current carrying water-cooled bus tubes in such a way that the center bus tube is raised to provide triangulation with those of the two longer outside ones. The electrodes protrude through the furnace roof onto the charging material and are arranged such that they form an equilateral triangle on the electrode pitch circle as illustrated in Fig. 2. It shows a top view of the furnace with extraneous assemblies, such as the roof swing support system (gantry arms) deleted for clarity. To aid in the analysis and because of the complex geometrical configuration of the electrode arms and auxiliary components, making an exact analysis impossible, an as simple and fundamental a geometry as possible is shown in Fig. 3, while still retaining the configuration of a particular design. It represents a cross section of the electrode arms indicating their construction and at the same time illustrates the triangulation of the bus tube system. There are two current buses per phase, each carrying half the electrode current, the center arm being the center phase of the supply. The triangulation throughout of the current supply system from the transformer delta closure to the electrodes is desired from an electrical point of view. It maintains the secondary impedance balanced as much as possible on a per phase basis by equalizing induced voltages. While this position is desirable from a power input and phase balance standpoint, it must be recognized that especially during furnace startup and the initial melt down stages this condition is seldom met in practice. This is because of different electrode lengths and uneven charging material levels under the electrodes. Fig. 4 and 5 schematically show possible relative elevations of the electrode arms with respect to each other from the desired position with regard to equilateral triangulation. The raised position of the center electrode arm, as indicated in Fig. 5, represents the worst possible condition from the

point of view of induced heating. It is also apparent that in this position the presence of the outside arms is of negligible influence as far as the effect on the induced losses in the center is concerned [11. Hence their effect on the center arm induced eddy current losses is assumed negligible in the calculations. This assumption is further substantiated from

For the purpose of the analysis, end-effects are neglected; this implies that the electric and magnetic fields are independent of the cylindrical coordinate (Q) perpendicular to the plane of the paper, reducing the problem to a twodimensional one. In addition, hysteresis and saturation phenomena are not included. The power loss density P, at any point inside the material depends on the magnitude of the magnetic vector potential A2 namely

POWER LOSS CALCULATION Referring to Fig. 3, the basic configuration consists of three pairs of bus tubes initially in the geometric arrangement indicated. During furnace operation, in the event where the center arm is raised from the desired position in relation to the outside arms, the induced eddy currents and subsequently the power losses giving rise to heating effects in the center arm become progressively worse. This can readily be seen in Fig. 5, where the center arm is adjacent to the outside bus tubes. Since the superposition theorem can be applied to the magnetic fields, the induced losses due to a single conductor is examined first. The resulting expression is then extended to account for all six conductors, properly accounting for their relative position in space around the center arm and their phase sequence of the supply frequency. Referring to Fig. 6, a single conductor is shown adjacent to the electrode arm, at first assumed to be of circular geo-

being the radial distance to the point where the potential is calculated which makes an angle p with the reference axis. The unknown integration constants C,, and D, can be determined by solving the boundary problem at p - a, which involves equating the tangential and normal components of the magnetic field, namely [4]

Taking into account their space location and electrical phase sequence, the total expression for the vector potential inside the material (by extending the previous analysis and using the superposition principle) becomes

Having determined the induced losses throughout the electrode arm material in the above manner, the task remains to relate this into expected temperature increases. In Fig. 9, the electrode arm construction is illustrated showing the water where the angle 0 refers to the angular displacement of the cooling paths. Because of the relatively thin wall thickness of bus tubes with respect to the reference axis and <p the angle the electrode arm body and good thermal conductivity of the at which the vector potential is calculated in the material material, the heat flow is taken to be one-dimensional across at the radial distance p from the center. All other symbols the plate material. This is an accurate assessment since the used are as explained or using the notation in Fig. 7. temperature difference between outside (furnace atmosphere) The transition from the circular electrode arm in Fig. 6 and inside (coolant) boundaries is relatively large. Also, the to the rectangular one in Fig. 7 should be noted. It is assumed induced losses vary greatly in this direction since the field that the rectangular geometry of the arm does not influence decays rapidly inside the material. Therefore, the temperature the basic expression (6) for the vector potential, which strictly calculation reduces to that of a plate with forced water cooling speaking is correct only for the circular geometry. However, on one side and convective and conductive air cooling on the this assumption seemed realistic in view of all other necessary other. The induced power loss inside the material is reprepractical simplifications made and proved to be justified in the sented by the internal heat generation term q"', which is subsequent work carried out.

This is done by calculating geometry, its "effective" circular radius a associated with that the radiant energy transfer between the surfaces in question point must then be determined. It is represented by the and comparing this to the convective and conductive heat distance SC in Fig. 8 (for an arbitrary field point P), measured transfer across the boundary.

A computer program was developed to obtain the power loss density at the nodal points throughout the cross section. The center arm was raised from the initially triangulated position and the losses calculated for each incremental step in center electrode arm elevation to the expected worst condition. Some computer calculated results for the center electrode arm using carbon steel (SAE 1010) material are shown in Fig. 11 and 12 for the selected center arm elevation h indicated. The power loss density ranges represented by the numbers are given in Table 1. Recalculating the losses when using stainless steel (304) material gives the results shown in Fig. 13 and 14 for identical center arm elevations.

savings in material costs, the use of stainless steel was therefore not warranted. This conclusion proved correct and has been substantiated after five months of sLucessful furnace operation. In addition, measurements on the center electrode arm discharge cooling-water system indicated water temperature rises not to exceed 38°C (compared to the intake) under the most severe furnace operating conditions. Furthermore, the use of stick-on temperature pads and an infrared temperature detector (Williamson 2200) indicated that surface temperatures resemble closely (in all circumstances within 10C) those predicted by the theory. This was true even for mneasurements taken at reduced flow rates when compared to corresponding predicted values.
