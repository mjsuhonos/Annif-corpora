Abstract
Integration and Persistence o f E scherichia coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 86-24 in a N aturally-O ccurring Water Well Biofilm.

D ebbie Kolozsvari, M .A.Sc Environm ental A pplied Science and M anagem ent Ryerson University Septem ber 2005 Studies to determ ine how a m icrobe can persist in a foreign environm ent are essential in understanding w ater contam ination by infectious agents. A nnular reactors w ere designed, constructed, and used as a laboratory-based model to study naturallyoccurring biofilm s. U ntreated groundw ater w as used as the bulk liquid, and a foreign m icrobe with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) m arker was introduced. It was dem onstrated that under oligotrophic conditions Escherichia coli 015 7 :H 7 86-24 did not grow planktonically. The m icrobe dem onstrated an ability to integrate into the existing biofilm . V arious environm entally-relevant concentrations o f nitrogen and phosphate w ere also used to detect any effects on its persistence. The results suggest that the persistence o f the E .coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 86-24 was enhanced w hen the bulk fluid was amended to contain 100 ppm nitrate, and hindered when phosphate was added. To utilize available m olecular tools, polym erase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with denaturing high perform ance liquid chrom atography (DH PLC) w ere used. It was found that the E.coli 0157:H 7-specific prim ers w ere not as reliable in detecting E.coli 0 1 5 7 w ithin the biofilm w hen com pared to detection using the G FP marker. PCR using 16S rRNA prim ers were also used to gain insight into the m icrobial diversity o f the biofilm .

Chapter 1 : Introduction

M icrobes establish them selves w ithin biofilm s in the subsurface, including the interface betw een groundw ater and a drilled-well. M icrobial ecology at this site is im portant to understand for two m ain reasons. The m icrobes that exist here contribute to biofouling o f wells. This is an im portant consideration particularly with respect to a w ell's construction and m aintenance. G roundw ater m icrobiology also plays a role in understanding the fate o f various pollutants, including nutrients and pathogens. It is therefore crucial to understand w hat interactions might occur when such contam inants encounter these naturally-existing biofilm s. This in turn can also potentially effect the m icrobial populations present. In Canada, our ability to gain easy access to large am ounts o f freshw ater has supported its widespread use for various hum an activities. An often noted source o f w ater contam inants is from the w aste effluent o f agricultural activities (Odgen et al., 2001). W aste effluent contributes to the increasing concentrations o f nutrients, such as

nitrate and phosphate, which can be transported to groundwater. A reas considered at risk occur w here intensive agriculture practices are located near untreated private w ater supplies. These changes in farm ing practices likely play a role in the increased exposure to pathogens such as E scherichia coli 0157;H 7 (Law, 2000. Odgen et al., 2001). T o aid in the process o f developing adequate w ater m anagem ent practices, pathogen persistence at the groundw ater/w ell interface should be studied. Since a pathogen, considered a foreign m icrobe, will com e into contact with indigenous m icrobial populations, com petition and cooperation am ong m icrobes m ust also be considered.

The purpose o f this study was to: (i) explore what tools are presently available and could be used to study well-water biofilms, and (ii) to gain insight into the persistence of a foreign microbe when it encounters a naturally-existing biofilm in well water. This persistence was examined under various, yet ecologically relevant concentrations of nitrate and phosphate. This was done since contaminants are increasingly being found in groundwater, and will have an impact on the dynamics o f a biofilm (Biksey & Gross, 2001, Environment Canada et. al., 2001).

1.1

Hypothesis

The underlying hypothesis of this study is that when a foreign microbe encounters a naturally-existing biofilm, it will be able to integrate, and persist. Nutrient concentrations will have an effect on the biofilm, and therefore impact the survivability o f a foreign microbe. Generally, a higher nutrient concentration would allow the indigenous microbes to out-compete, and therefore limit foreign microbe persistence. However, small increases in nutrients, although still considered oligotrophic, will aid survivability.

E xperim ental A pproach

A nnular reactors are com m only used in lab studies that require the grow th o f biofilm s on m icroscope slides in a controlled environm ent. Since com m ercial reactors are expensive, annular reactors w ere first designed, constructed, and tested as a practical m eans o f grow ing biofilm s. The reactors w ere run using well w ater as the bulk fluid. A m endm ents w ere made to the source w ater to create slightly different nutrient environm ents. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled m icrobe, Escherichia coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7

This was the only enterohaem oniiagic E. coli (EHEC) 0 1 5 7 ;H 7 strain that was used in the study, and will also be referred to as E.coli 86-24-GFP. The persistence o f E. coli 86-24-GFP was m onitored with its GFP m arker using an inverted, epifluorescence m icroscope, and a confocal scanning laser m icroscope. Slides were scraped to collect biofilm for extraction o f genomic DNA and analysis using E. coli 0157-specific prim ers. To gain insight into species diversity, 16S rRN A prim ers were also utilized. A relatively new technique, DHPLC (denaturing high perform ance liquid chrom atography), was im plem ented to analyze the results.

1.3

Thesis Outline

To test the hypothesis, four objectives were pursued:

1.

To design, and construct two annular reactors to study biofilms in a laboratory.

2.

To establish a naturally-occurring biofilm in an annular reactor and to introduce a traceable, foreign microbe.

3.

To obtain detectable differences in survivability under ecologically relevant parameters.

4.

To monitor foreign microbe survivability, and microbial diversity using a combination o f microscopy and techniques in molecular biology.

Chapter 2: Literature Review

2.1

M icrobial E co lo g y

B oth eukaryotic and prokaryotic m icrobes exist in m any environm ents, although prokaryotes have a greater range in the subsurface. Filtration by particle size and a lack o f organic m atter are likely the m ain reasons (M aier, et ai. 2000). O rganism s such as Fungi, Algae, and Protozoa are part o f the m ore com plex Eukaryotes. Prokaryotes, with a sim pler structure, are m ade up o f two dom ains: bacteria, and archaea. A rchabacteria are typically found in m ore extrem e habitats. All o f these types o f bacteria tend to grow rapidly under favorable conditions, and will shrink from a typical size o f
1 - 2

pm , to less

than 0.3 pm in a m ore stressful environm ent. They are then referred to as ultram icrobacteria. U ltram icrobacteria are m ajor contributors to the w orld's biosphere w ith respect to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling (V am am & Evans, 2000). Bacteria are also defined based on the properties o f their cell wall. G ram -positive and gram -negative bacteria are found in soil, water, and in subsurface environm ents (Brock and M adigan, 1991). Two survival strategies are often em ployed by microbes. Copiotrophs, or rstrategists form resting stage cells, which can have sudden bursts o f growth. Oligotrophs, or k-strategists, grow slowly w ith interm ittent periods o f starvation or faster growth (O strow ski, et al. 2001). Some com m only used groups o f m icroorganism s are autotrophs, heterotrophs, psychrophiles, therm ophiles, aerobes, and anaerobes (V am am & Evans, 2000).

Although prokaryotes are not as complex as eukaryotes, they are extremely diverse. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) houses many sequence databases, including a prokaryote archive of over 30,000 species. This is an impressive collection, however recent estimates suggest the sea, for example, may contain closer to two million different bacteria. One ton of soil could contain four million different bacteria. Of the 30,000 logged bacteria, only 13,000 are formally described. Furthermore, of the forty known Divisions, ninety percent of the sequences are part of only four Divisions (NCBI website, 2004). Despite its large size, the database is clearly not a true representation of the many species that exist in nature. More work is needed to determine what microbes are indigenous in a particular environment (NCBI website, 2004). Many studies have now demonstrated the ability to detect microbial populations from groundwater. Over a three-year study in Virginia, McKeon et al., 1995, were able to detect more than 250 coliform and non-coliform bacteria from rural, untreated wells. The microbes were collected by membrane filtration to look at the occurrence of antibiotic resistance. Some of the coliforms found included Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae. Non-coliforms \nc\\xdQd Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Serratia marcescens (McKeon et al., 1995). Bacterial diversity can be determined experimentally using 16S rRNA genes. Microbial diversity in surface waters, groundwater, wastewater plants, and even bottled water, has been examined (Ovreas, et al., 1997., Watanabe, et al., 2000 & 2001, Boon et al., 2002., Dewettinck, et al., 2001). These genes are used to identify both culturable and unculturable bacteria, because they are analyzed by amplifying fragments of microbial

genom ic D N A rather than by selective culturing. The 16S rRNA genes are used because they are crucial for protein translation. This m akes them well conserved overall, but with som e variation betw een different species, DNA from environm ental sam ples is used as the tem plate to am plify a region o f the gene. The sequences obtained can then com pared to any existing sequence databases, such as the G enBank database from NCBI. A new sequence found in this m anner will be listed as 'uncultured bacterium ' since it m ust be isolated and cultured for further characterization. The sequence inform ation can also be entered into software that clusters the represented bacteria based on the sim ilarity o f sequences. There are a large num ber o f studies that have used a com bination o f denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) w ith 16S rRNA prim ers as a m eans o f determ ining the species present in a population o f m icrobes. As an exam ple, Ibekwe et al., 2003 used D G G E and 16S rRNA. to look at the bacteria com m unity present in constructed w etlands and manure. U sing this technique, they were able to determ ine that the dom inant bacteria in their samples was related to Bacillus, Clostridium, Mycoplasma, Eubacterium, and Proteobacteria, w hich are also found in the gastrointestinal tracts o f m am m als. They also found that a higher percentage o f Nitrospira-Uke sequences were found in the w etlands, com pared w ith N itrosom onas-like sequences in the m anure, as well as, in feces and raw w ashw ater (Ibekwe et al., 2003).

2.2

Microbial Ecology: Survivability

Prokaryotes have the widest range of conditions in which they can survive. This persistence is due to great metabolic versatility, and phenotypic plasticity. Microbes are able to adapt when a new niche presents itself (Davey and O'Toole, 2000). Fossil records indicate that a long-used method of enhancing survivability in various environments has been the formation of biofilms (Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004). This is especially true for nonendospore-forming bacteria. A biofilm lifestyle is so ubiquitous, it is likely the essential characteristic in which bacteria persist (Davey and O'Toole, 2000). Bacteria would only exist outside of a biofilm if it had been sloughed off and was in transit to another biofilm. Considering that biofilms are physiologically different than plankontic bacteria, our knowledge of microbes is therefore limited. Biofilm persistence is due to changes in phenotype, inactivation by extracellular polymers or modifying enzymes, or nutrient limitation which slows growth rate (Davey and O'Toole, 2000). Natural environments usually have a diverse population of microbes. They develop in spatially organized physicochemical gradients. In low nutrient levels, biofilms are a few micrometers thick, and will be organized vertically or horizontally depending on the gradient. Many conflicting lifestyles can grow in close proximity. This allows the microbes to obtain some of the benefits of multicellular life. Cometabolism, cross-feeding, and protection from disasters all lead to long-term stability. Adaptation has been considered a trait only seen in gram-negative bacteria, but some gram-positive have also displayed this ability (Vamam & Evans, 2000, Maier et al., 2000).

C om petition in biofilm s is an interesting area o f study. In 1964, W .D. H am ilton first proposed the theory o f kin selection as an altruistic cooperative behavior. By helping relatives, this would help the species to proliferate as a whole. A study by Griffin et ah, 2004, studied this possibility in bacteria. They found that when P seudom onas aeruginosa produced siderophores. m olecules excreted to scavenge iron, it proliferated w hen it was grown in a biofilm where there was a high degree o f relatedness. They did not proliferate w hen there was a low degree o f relatedness. This suggests that the bacteria are w illing to expend the energy and allow other bacteria to utilize the benefits o f its actions more so when they are more closely related. However, eventually these closest neighbors w ould also becom e the m ain com petition, where the altruistic behavior w ould cease (Griffin et al., 2004). Therefore, the scale o f the com petition m ust be considered. W hen the extrem e diversity o f the natural environm ent is considered, it is a daunting task to gain insight into such unm atched diversity found among other living organism s. Growth o f some m icroorganism s can be easily achieved when placed in a nutrient rich m edium where they can begin dividing w ithin ten minutes. Cell division in subsurface environm ents could, how ever, take up to
1 0 0

years due the nutrient poor, and

heterogeneous conditions (V am am & Evans, 2000). Understanding how a pathogen survives is very difficult considering the extreme com plexity and various factors m aking up these m icroenvironm ents.

2.3

Biofilms

Biofilm is a sessile community of microbes. It is characterized by its attachment to a solid surface, where it is embedded in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). EPS is a key, and hence well-studied, component of the biofilm. It is discussed in greater detail in Section 2.3.2. Bacteria, fungi, metabolic byproducts, clay, and soil are all possible components comprising a biofilm. Biofilm is also characterized by a distinct change in phenotype with respect to growth, gene expression, and protein production (Shirliff et al., 2002). In fact, Sauer et al., 2002, demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa has multiple phenotypes during biofilm development. The net result is a complex structure of microcolonies with a network of channels allowing the passage o f nutrients (Johnston, 2004, Shirtliff et al., 2002, Sauer et al., 2002). In an environment where nutrients are not abundant, bacteria benefit significantly if they form a biofilm (White et al., 1999). Other factors that usually limit bacterial survival are a lack of oxygen, as well as competitive, antagonistic, and predatory activities of indigenous populations. The biofilm will capture and concentrate nutrients, including carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate. Biofilms also offer protection against antimicrobial factors. This may be due to the reduced metabolic levels, and downregulated rates of cell division. It also prevents certain chemicals from entering into the biofilm by acting as an ion exchanger. This is especially pronounced for hydrophilic, positively-charged antibiotics (Davey & O'Toole, 2000, Shirtliff et al., 2002). The environmental conditions also play a large role in shaping the biofilm structure. Examples include substratum properties, nutrient availability, community '

10

com position, and hydrodynam ics o f the bulk fluid. In areas o f high shear stress, biofilm s tend to be stratified and com pact. B iofilm s under laminar flow are found to be patchy, w ith rough round cell aggregates spaced by interstitial voids. Turbulent flows also have patchy grow th, and w ill have elongated stream ers in the flow (D avey and O 'Toole, 2000). H igh nutrient levels affect the biofilm by allowing a rapid increase in thickness, but the overall film stability m ay be reduced. The density o f a biofilm tends to increase w ith the direction o f the flow. W ith age. biofilm s become denser suggesting that existing pores and cham iels inside the biofilm decrease as the biofilm ages. N utrient diffusion through biofilm s tends to be slow w here only lim ited am ounts reach the deeper layers (V arm an & Evans, 2000). B iofilm s are dynam ic: cells peel away (usually the m ore hydrophilic cells), and provide a supply o f inoculum for the developm ent o f biofilm s elsewhere. This can occur as a result o f fluid shearing, or due to a genetically program m ed response that directs the detachm ent process (S hirtliff et al.. 2002). D espite sloughing off, biofilm s usually becom e thicker over tim e. The quiescent cells, which are oligotrophs, will fair better in the low er layers. How ever, if the film does becom e too thick, even the well adapted m icrobes w ill die, causing fragility, and sloughing off (Shirtliff et al., 2002). D irect observation o f m icrobial populations and biological activity is needed to provide inform ation on population dynam ics, and m etabolic processes. Confocal scanning laser m icroscopy (C LSM ) has been comm only used to study the developm ent and structure o f biofilm s in a nondestructive manner. Num erical inform ation about biofilm m orphology can be accom plished with digital processing. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has also been used w ith success as a reporter protein for gene expression

11

(Lowder et al, 2000). Having such tools is necessary to understand the complexity of biofilms. Biofilms have been implicated as the primary cause of biological contamination in drinking water distribution systems. Some recent studies have also proposed that biofilms in groundwater provide favorable conditions for pathogens introduced into the subsurface, however there is little experimental data on the conditions in which biofilms provide protections for pathogens, and the extent to which this may occur (Banning et al., 2003).

2.3.1 Biofilm development

Surfaces in contact with liquid will develop a conditioning film within seconds. This may only be a film that has a thickness measured in nanometers, and the properties of the film will affect subsequent biofilm formation. Colonization to a `clean' surface is called the primary biofilm, and their progeny is called the secondary biofilm. Primary cells experience a lag in their growth possibly due to its adaptation to a sessile environment, and also due to phenotypic changes (Johnston, 2004, Shirtliff et a l, 2002). Biofilm formation occurs in the natural environment and in living tissues. A fundamental difference in biofilm formation in the environment is that it is non-specific, whereas in living tissues it is specific. This non-specificity, however, may not be that straightforward. In Stewart et aVs 1995 study, they found biofilm to be several hundred microns thick in some places, and bare substratum in others. Staining of cells with ethidium bromide, and EPS with calcufluor showed that some cell-free areas were filled

12

w ith EPS. The exact reasons w hy som e areas o f the sam e substratum are occupied and other are not, is not understood (Johnston, 2003). B iofilm begins to develop w hen various m olecules absorb at a liquid/solid interface. T hese m olecules m ay include proteins, polysaccharides, hum ic acids, and fatty acids and lipids. This conditioning film will then have an effect on surface hydrophobicity and charge. In this early stage, m icrobial colonization will largely depend on transport from the bulk fluid. Once transported to the site o f attachm ent, adherence will depend on surface propeilies. the physiological state o f the m icrobes, and hydrodynam ics near the surface (Bandfield & N ealson, 1997). A dhesion m ay be affected by cell appendages, or excretion o f adhesives (Scheuerm an el al.. 1998). W hen com pared w ith planktonic bacteria, surface-induced gene expression is m arkedly different. This is likely because the form ation o f a biofilm requires coordination (com m unication and interactions) am ong various bacterial species. The bacteria begin to orient them selves, and cluster (Davey and O 'T oole, 2000). W hen the cell cluster reaches a thickness o f approxim ately 10 um, it is considered m ature. A t this stage the biofilm may also be dispersed if it begins to slough off. The cluster structure changes with the developm ent o f pores and channels, and both m otile and nonm otile forms o f the m icrobes will be present. The protein profile at this stage m ore closely resem bles that o f planktonic bacteria. W hen the protein profile in a biofilm was exam ined, over 800 proteins, or over 50% o f the proteom e, had a sixfold or greater expression level. An im portant transcriptional regulator that turns on antibiotic resistance (by inducing transcription o f efflux pum ps) was among the upregulated genes (D avey and O 'Toole, 2000). R ate o f colonization varies, and the stability m ay take hours to m onths

13

to develop (Vamman & Evans, 2002). Rice et al., 2000, looked at growth rates in biofilms. They found that planktonic and secondary biofilm cells grew faster than the primary biofilm cells when exposed to the same nutrient conditions. The parent cells were able to form dense microcolonies that could disperse within minutes. The daughter cells were found tightly packed, spread out, rolling, forming chains, or becoming detached. How the daughter cells form was likely determined by species, but also influenced by environmental conditions (Rice et al., 2000).

2.3.2 Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)

Bacteria produce wall polysaccharides (capsules), or excreted polysaccharides. These excreted substances provide the backbone of the biofilm. The polysachharides that usually make up the EPS are rhamnose, galactose, glucosamine, galacturonic acid, or hyaluronic acid. Polypeptides or cellulose can also make up the EPS. The EPS is bound by electrostatic interactions with the outer wall polymers. With exceptions, EPS is released at the end of the exponential growth phase, or during the stationary (starvation) phase, and favors adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces. This has been seen in marine environments where small cells (associated with starvation) are seen to first adhere to a surface (Vamam & Evans, 2002). The presence of nutrients and minerals caught in the biofilm give the biofilm a net negative charge on the matrix. Flagella, pili, fimbria, and EPS are the main means of microbes interacting with their environment (Hoppert, 2003). It provides a close proximity for horizontal gene transfer. This may occur between bacteria by conjugation, or by infection of bacteriophages. It has been estimated that 10-

14

20% o f the bacterial population are lysed daily by bacteriophages (D avey and O 'Toole, 2000). EPS protects cells from environm ental stresses, such as sudden changes in pH, w ater content, and antibiotic agents. In a less stressful environm ent, such as that experienced by lab strains, the ability to produce EPS m ay be lost entirely (D avey and O 'T oole, 2000).

2.4

Escherichia coli 0 \5 1 :Y il

E scherichia coli are found in the hum an body as a facultative anaerobe found in the hum an intestinal tract. The specific reasons as to w hy it is successful here is unknow n, how ever its ability to utilize gluconate in the colon, m ight give it a unique niche. A relatively recently described pathogen found in freshw ater is the strain E.coli 0157.H 7, an EHEC. It w as after tw o outbreaks in 1985 that E. coli 0 1 5 7 was recognized as a hum an enteric pathogen. The earliest probable case was first recorded in 1975, although it m ay have also been the cause o f some diarrheal outbreaks in the United States during the 1950s (Law, 2000). EHEC causes haem orrhagic colitis (bloody diarrhea), and haem olytic urem ic syndrom e (HUS). The m ain reservoir for EHEC is in the bovine intestinal tract. It is very infectious where the dose can be as low as 10 to 100 cells (H ayashi et al., 2001). E. coli 0 1 5 7 has now been studied extensively in the food industry to better understand how it can potentially infect hum ans due to its persistence in various types o f food. In 2000, an outbreak occurred in W alkerton, O ntario. This again dem onstrated the potential for serious and lethal infection o f E.coli 0 1 5 7 from untreated water. A s a

15

result, recent studies have begun to assess the transport and persistence of E. coli 0157;H7 and other pathogens in groundwater. The Walkerton tragedy lost seven people to E.coli 0157.-H7 when the town's drinking water was not properly treated with chlorine. A further 2,000 individuals also became ill during the outbreak. As a result, the site was extensively tested and thoroughly cleaned before the water was considered safe to drink. It was determined that a spring rainstorm washed E.coli 0157;H7 into a poorly planned and maintained town well (well 5). The rainfall event occurred on May 12, 2000, and five days later, on May 19, 2000. the first symptoms of bloody diarrhea, vomiting, cramps, and fever occurred. Incompetent water managers combined with government downsizing were the main factors leading to the disaster (Websource; www.ene.gov.on.ca/envision/techdocs/4000e01.htm). The results of phenotypic and molecular typing supported the hypothesis that the municipal water supply was contaminated by a farm. Waste from a farm entered well 5 where E.coli 0157;H7 gained access to the well and then into the water distribution system. Well 5 was later decommissioned (Clark et al. 2003). As a result of the Walkerton E.coli 0157:H7 outbreak, two major reports were produced by the Ministry of Environment, prepared by the Honourable Dennis R. O'Connor. New well regulations went into effect in August 2003, but still did not meet the Walkerton inquiry recommendations. Some specific concerns were that; (i) the standards for disinfecting wells with chlorine was lowered, (ii) there were no requirements to clean newly drilled wells, (iii) no requirement to seal water line connections, and (vi) contractors could construct wells with used well materials (Websource: www.nupge.ca/news_2003/nl2au03b.htm).

16

Tw enty-one recom m endations from the first report have now been im plem ented, and the rem aining seven are still underway. The second W alkerton report m ade 93 recom m endations, and that an additional 49 m illion dollars be spent each year to ensure safe w ater in Ontario. As o f May 2005. 39 recom m endations have been im plem ented, 28 are being im plem ented through legislation, and 26 are still underw ay (W ebsource: w w w .ene.gov.on.cayenvision/w ater/sdw a/status_part2.htm , w w w .ene.gov.on.ca/ envision/w ater/sdw a/ status_part 1 .htm). E .coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 is unique from other E .coli in that it produces the Shiga toxin (Stx). The shiga toxin is a verocytotoxin (VT) which ultim ately cleaves rRNA, effectively preventing protein synthesis (K aper et al.. 2004). M any serotypes o f EHEC have now been identified. One strain o f E .coli 0157:H 7 was isolated by researchers in Japan and its sequence was com pared to the benign laboratory strain E. coli K-12. They found that E. coli 0 1 5 7 's genomic DNA w as 5.5 m egabases (M b), or 859 kilobases (Kb) larger than E.coli K-12. M ost o f the DNA com m on to both bacteria was highly conserved. The rem aining was m ade o f 0157-specific sequences (Hayashi et al. 2001). Several genes responsible for the production o f 0 1 5 7 's toxin production are encoded on a plasm id. O verall, it was found that E .coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 had 1632 proteins and 20 tR N A s not found in K-12, w here 131 o f the proteins are thought to contribute to its virulence (Hayashi et al. 200). The Shiga toxin was probably acquired during plasm id transfer through a bacteriophage from Shigella dysenteriae. Bacteriophages appear to have played a role since 24 prophages and prophage-like elem ents were found in m ore than h a lf o f the 0 1 5 7 -sp ecific sequences (Hayashi et al. 200). The toxin is identical to the Shigella toxin

17

that causes dysentery. It has been proposed that there might have been a selective pressure for E.coli 0 1 57:H7 to maintain this plasmid, because it could help defend itself from attack by amoebas (Websource: http://exn.ca/stories/2000/06/07/53.asp).

2.5

Escherichia coli 0157:H 7 Survivability

E.coli 0157:H7 has been shown to be culturable for days to weeks from various sources, including water samples (Porter el al., 1997). Microbes in the natural environment will be exposed to a variety of stresses. To persist, they must be able to survive changing conditions. Various conditions may enhance the growth of particular microbes giving them a competitive advantage over other microbes. Less adapted microbes will either die off, or go into a hibernation state until conditions become more favorable to growth. These microcosms are always dynamic and changing. Survival rate of E.coli 0157:H7 from manure applied to farmland, has been shown to decrease at higher temperatures (15°C), and a low moisture content (Odgen et al., 2001). In a food study on seasonings, bacterial growth was suppressed with low water activity, but E. coli 0157-.H7 strains were found to be tolerant of such conditions (Yokoigawa et al., 1999). Understanding how pathogens might survive in the subsurface is difficult to determine. Pathogens that obtain their required nutrients with the smallest amount of energy expended are considered the most highly evolved or adapted (Baron, 1996). E.coli 0157:H7 has been reported to only form a biofilm in low-nutrient conditions (Davey and O'Toole, 2000).

18

Studies have show n that a heavy rainfall event is the prim ary m eans by w hich E .coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 w ill be vertically transported into soil. Tillage practice, soil type, and m ethod o f pathogen delivery can affect, but ultim ately do not prevent vertical coliform transport in soil. O bservations m ade in a study by Gagliardi and K am s in 2000, suggested that soluble nitrogen could enhance transport (Ibekwe et al., 2003, Gagliardi & K am s, 2000, Odgen et al., 2001). The source o f E.coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 in cattle is not wellestablished, but one possibility is cattle feed contam inated by fecal matter. There are studies now underw ay attem pting to gain insight into both transport o f E.coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 , and its persistence in anim al and hum an foods. For exam ple, a study by Dodd et a l, 2002, found that in feed, E.coli 0157:H 7 concentrations were higher if there was an increase in lactate concentration, a decrease in propionate, or a higher pH. T heir w ork also show ed that survival o f E.coli 0157:H 7 in feces was considered long, and that the m icrobe is also likely to survive in w ater troughs (Dodd et al., 2002). The fate o f a pathogen in soils and aquifers is governed by its transport and persistence into the environm ent. Persistence and transport is also controlled by clim ate, type o f soil/aquifer, properties o f pore fluids, and type o f pathogen. For exam ple, the negative charge on bacterial cells and the size o f the pores they encounter, influence its interaction with its environm ent. Enteric bacterial survival in soil has been studied for a num ber o f years, and it has been observed that their persistence is increased by low er tem peratures, high soil m oisture content, and abundant organic m atter. Persistence is decreased in m ore acidic soils, and a high exposure to sunlight. A pathogen m ust also deal w ith com petition and antagonism from other bacteria, as well as predation by protozoa (M itchell, 1992).

19

A small number of studies have been performed both in the field and lab, to examine microbial persistence. The persistence o ï E.coli 0157:H7 and Psuedomonas aeruginosa in groundwater was examined in a laboratory system by Banning et al., 2003. Their hypothesis was that groundwater-derived biofilms may act as a reservoir for coliform and pathogenic bacteria. A GFP-labeled E. coli 0 1 57:H7 was used and found to colonize all layers of a mixed-population biofilm developed using groundwater microbes. Their data suggest that an increase in available nutrients could reduce E. coli 0157:H 7's survival potential due to enhanced competition or enhanced antagonism by the microbial population (Banning et al., 2003). Few field studies have been conducted with respect to E. coifs survivability in well water. Survival of E.coli 0157:111 was examined in private drinking water wells in Scotland. This study, by Artz and Killham, 2002, looked at E.coli 0157:H7's ability to survive under different heavy metal contents, nutrient, and bacterial grazer concentrations. They found its survival mainly decreased with increasing copper concentrations. This in combination with high protozoan counts had the greatest negative effect on survival time, suggesting that higher quality water would actually allow longer survival times for E. coli 0157 (Artz & Killham, 2002). The effect of copper is interesting as it is a commonly used material: it can result from leaching of corroding pipes, and extensive use of sewage sludge as a soil amendment (Artz & Killham, 2002). Lab studies using annular reactors are numerous, and some of these have studied coliforms in biofilms. A study by Camper et al., 1996 operated annular reactors using oligotrophic conditions to look at the influence of growth conditions and substratum on long-term persistence of coliforms in mixed-population biofilms. In their 8 -week

20

experim ents, they found that larger num bers occurred when m ild steel w as used instead o f polycarbonate. They also found that slowly grow n coliform s survived at the highest concentrations (Cam per et al., 1996). The low est initial growth rate o f 0.05/h enabled the coliform s to com pete w ith biofilm s already present. This success w as likely due to the acclim atization to low -nutrient conditions (Cam per e( al., 1996). It is clear that there are m any factors influencing what will be present in groundw ater. Each private well w ould need to be accessed individually to determ ine its particular potential for allow ing E.coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 to persist. In general how ever, it seem s that current literature suggests oligotrophic conditions help E.coli 0 1 5 7 ;H 7 to persist in the subsurface environm ent, and eutrophic conditions give natural m icrobial populations a com petitive advantage over the pathogen.

2.6

Groundwater and W aterw ells

The subsurface environm ent is extrem ely heterogeneous, hut som e general com m ents can be made. The saturated zone, beneath the vadose zone, is considered oligotrophic, w here the organic carbon content is less than 0.1%. M any types o f aquifers in the subsurface exist. Shallow aquifers are recharged by rainfall or rivers, and typically have a high flow rate. Interm ediate aquifers are within 300 m eters o f the surface, and have slow er flow rates. Deep aquifers are not directly recharged by rain and have the slow est flow rates. Shallow aquifers tend to be aerobic, as faster flow rates tend to increase the am ount o f oxygen present (V am am & Evans, 2000). A nother consideration

is the material in which the groundwater is found. Some may be in loose sand or gravel, or within rock materials. The usefulness of groundwater for human use is determined by its recharge and storage capacity (Nuzman, 1978). Groundwater is accessed by drilling a well. A well experiences its best condition when it has first been drilled. Natural processes will then degrade the well over time (Nuzman, 1978). Therefore, it is necessary for wells to be properly protected when it is being used and then properly decommissioned to protect the groundwater from direct contamination by the surface. This direct access to the surface can provide a quick route for groundwater to become contaminated. An important component in well construction is the well screen that is sometimes placed at the location where water is drawn into the well. Its role is to help prevent clogging, and maintain an acceptable flow into the well. A good understanding of the aquifer permeability will determine this optimum screen velocity (Nuzman, 1978). The well will then create the environment where biofilms will begin to develop. Since wells vary depending on the type drilled, and other factors already mentioned, it is again difficult to determine the specific environmental conditions in this region and how it might affect the types of microbes that exist there. Rainwater is often a source of recharge for groundwater. Rain usually has a pH of 5.4, and therefore considered a weak carbonic acid solution. Once it hits the ground, various materials will be absorbed. The water then continues through the soil, developing a migration path until it finds its way into an aquifer. During its transport, water will dissolve some of the minerals in which it makes contact. In this manner, groundwater will then contain soluble iron as the water makes its way through clay. Depending on how long the water stays in the soil, it might also dissolve organics

22

(N uzm an, 1978). In areas w here fertilizers are used, and i f the soil is oxygen rich, nitrates can also becom e dissolved and build up in groundw ater. If the w ater com es into contact w ith lim estone or shale, calcium will be dissolved. W hen low pressure is created in the well due to pum ping, carbon dioxide will then be released, which causes calcium bicarbonate to precipitate into calcium carbonate. Iron can also precipitate around the well screen. Overall this will cause a loss o f perm eability and a decrease in well efficiency. I f iron bacteria begin to grow, they too can clog the well screen further reducing the productivity o f the well (Nuzman, 1978). G roundw ater contam ination occurs w hen various substances enter the subsurface as a result o f hum an activities. W hen this happens, the contam inants are likely to spread. This is particularly true w hen contam inants reach sand or gravel aquifers. For exam ple, in V ille M ercier, Quebec, som e industries had disposed o f its waste into sandy lagoons subsequently contam inating the groundw ater used by thousands o f residents (Environm ent Canada et al., 2001). N ot only is cleanup o f such a site difficult, but it also com plicates our understanding o f where these contam inants m ay be transported. C ontam ination can come from point and non-point sources (Table 1). The overall extent o f groundw ater contam ination is very poorly understood, and an understanding is typically not sought for an area unless its users becom e ill. There are various exam ples across C anada, including the exam ple above in V ille M ercier in Quebec, pesticides in the prairies, industry effects in Elm ira, and salt from deicing in Nova Scotia. It is expected that the discovery o f contam inated aquifers will increase over the com ing decades. This is a serious concern because once contam inated, the aquifer will likely rem ain that way for decades longer. R esident tim es o f contam inants are anyw here from tw o w eeks to

23

10,000 years. Since groundwater is part of the hydrologie cycle, it can be expected that the contamination in one area will to spread into another. Protection by groundwater management is important, but will be limited by our lack of understanding in groundwater behavior including microbial ecology at this site (Environment Canada et. a l,
2 0 0 1

).

Table; 1. Sources of contamination in groundwater.

Non-point Sources Fertilizers Pesticides on agricultural land and forests Contaminants in rain, snow

Point sources Leaky tanks or pipelines containing gas Underground injection wells (industrial) Municipal landfills Livestock wastes Leaky sewer lines Mill tailings Fly ash from Coal plants (emitting flue) Graveyards Land spreading of sewage/ sewage sludge

Microorganisms are found in the subsurface. Population densities in groundwater are estimated to be between 105- 107 cells per gram dry weight (gdw). This is small when compared to microbial counts in the soil and unsaturated zone, but expected since

24

the concentration o f organic m atter is low er in groundw ater. M icrobial counts do not necessarily decrease with depth. There is great variability vertically and laterally. For exam ple, m ore bacteria are found in sandy sedim ents than clay sedim ents. This is likely due to the m ore difficult m ovem ent o f both m icrobes and dissolved nutrients through clay (Schw artz & Zhang, 2003).

2.6.1 N utrient Contam ination: Phosphorus

Phosphorus is one o f the least m obile o f nutrients found in soil. The negative charge on the phosphate ion form s insoluble com pounds w ith positive ions in the upper soil (alum inum and iron in acid soils, and calcium in basic soils). Furtherm ore, phosphorus will be absorbed to clay colloids and organic m atter in the soil (Loehr, 1974). H ow ever, if heavy rainfall occurs, phosphate m ay not have tim e to m ineralize. U nder anaerobic conditions, the reductions o f iron to ferrous salts m ay act to increase phosphorus m obility. Some studies have show n this, as well as further m obility if the soil is sandy. The Lake Erie basin has a high am ount o f sandy soils. Such conditions could allow phosphorus to reach groundw ater (Loehr, 1974). Shallow soils, and fractured structure o f lim estone will also facilitate m ovem ent o f percolates to groundw ater (Loehr, 1974). N orth A m erican guidelines recom m end that phosphate (ortho, PO4) should not be m ore than 0.2m g/L, a concentration w hich reduces the eutrophication o f w ater (W ebsource: http://w w w .pscanalytical.com /tech/qualityguide.asp).

25

2.6.2 Nutrient Contamination: Nitrogen

Nitrate, unlike phosphorus, is very soluble in water, and therefore very mobile within soil solution (Cepuder & Shukla, 2002). Nitrogen forms the readily exchangeable ammonium ion. An exception to this is if the ammonium ion is absorbed to clay minerals such as vermiculite, illite, and/or montmorillonite, all of which have a high affinity for
NH4. If in solution, ammonium can be volatized as gaseous ammonia, or undergo

nitrification to form the highly mobile nitrate ion (Loehr, 1974). Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococciis are involved in the first step, converting ammonia to nitrite. Nitrobacter are involved in the second step, converting nitrite to nitrate. This is inhibited in acidic soils, and at temperatures below 4°C (Loehr, 1974). The Ontario Drinking Water Standard (ODWS) for ammonia is O.lmg/L in groundwater (Ontario Regulation 169/03). Concentrations above this value indicate that contamination has occurred. Ammonia is also sometimes corrosive to copper and its alloys, which may corrode pipes. Nitrogen as nitrate, NO 3 ', is the most common form. It exists in oxic conditions with a redox potential (Eh) that is greater than +200mV. Nitrates might encourage bacterial growth, which could in turn increase biofouling. Levels above 13mg/L have been observed to cause well-related problems (Borch et al., 1993). Application of animal manure has been used as a means of recycling nitrogen and phosphorus back into the land. The manure will also contain bacteria, including various pathogens. (Odgen et a l, 2001, Gagliami & Karns, 2000). Higher nitrate levels in groundwater have been found near agriculture (Kemp & Dodds, 2001). In the UK,

26

research to understand how agricultural practices affect groundw ater has increased, and nitrate is a particular concern. One study by W ithers ef al ., 1997 looked at lagoon storage o f cow slurry, and how effective they are at self-sealing. The lagoon w as m onitored from 1975 to 1982. They found that up to 1978. N O 3 rem ained steady at 5m g/L (only fluctuating w ith season and water table levels). There were then sudden spikes in all nutrients in January 1979, January 1981. and Septem ber 1981. Nitrate levels were alw ays found betw een 0-17 ppm. and phosphate betw een 0-10 ppm. The large increases in nutrient concentrations also coincided with the occurrence o f E.coli in the sam ples. The general conclusions o f the study w ere that groundw ater beneath the lagoon was polluted and that the self-sealing layer did not persist. W astew ater from intense agricultural activities generally have higher nutrient concentrations, and organic m atter than m unicipal effluent (Ibekwe et al.. 2003). This can contribute to w ater m anagem ent problem s. Constructed wetlands are used to im prove w ater quality by utilizing bacterial degradation, how ever in this study, only m oderate rem oval o f total nitrogen and phosphorus w as detected. The use o f such a natural system depends on developing a healthy m icrobial com m unity for optim al w astew ater treatm ent (Ibekwe et al., 2003). C ertain m icrobial groups in animal w aste are responsible for the breakdow n o f organic com pounds, and for the suppression o f pathogens (Ibekwe et al., 2003). D iversity o f

m icrobes in a w etland environm ent m ay be critical for proper functioning and m aintenance o f the system.

27

2.6.3 Nitrogen levels in Canada

Seventy-five percent of all Canadians use water from municipal sewer systems. In 1999, 97% of this group had some type of waste treatment. The remaining 3% had no treatment at all. The remaining 25% of Canadians use private wells and septic systems that are designed for rural settings. Some rural areas are now being developed into subdivisions, and far more individual wells are being installed to supply high population densities. This could endanger the ability of the aquifer to sustain itself. With poorly maintained septic systems, a pollution problem is far more likely to occur. Once contaminated groundwater spreads to rivers and lakes, this could turn into a greater water supply problem. (Websource: www.canadianenvironmental.com, www.ec.gc.ca/water/en/manage/poll/e_howgrd.htm) With the exception of British Columbia and the Territories, 90% of rural domestic and water consumed by livestock is from groundwater. The Canadian Government has been monitoring rural wells to look at nutrient levels in the groundwater, and the data was presented in a report: Nutrients in the Canadian environment (Environment Canada et. al.,
2 0 0 1

). Canada has a large and diverse land, so different concentrations are expected.

In the prairies, dry climate and clay texture should minimize nutrient transport to groundwater. The nitrate levels in Alberta are also low, but this is likely due to fact that it has few shallow aquifers. Since Saskatchewan has many shallow and unconfined aquifers, contamination is more likely. The results showed that, in Alberta only 4-6% o f domestic wells had nitrate levels above the ODWS of 10 ppm. In Saskatchewan, 60% o f farm wells, and 36% of private wells had nitrate levels exceeding lOppm. Furthermore,

28

m ost o f the w ells w ith elevated nitrate w ere close to cattle and/or poultry farms. I n Quebec, one set o f results found an area w ith intensive potato farm ing to have 63.6% o f the 33 dom estic w ells sam pled to exceed the limit. Sim ilar findings w ere found in A tlantic Provinces, w here 13-40% o f w ells were above lOppm nitrate, w ith a dependency on season, and proxim ity to farm ing operations. Overall, regional surveys are found nitrate to exceed lOppm the guideline anyw here from 1.5-60% in the w ells tested (Environm ent C anada et al., 2001).

Chapter 3; Methodology

3.1

Annular reactors

A wide variety of annular reactors have been used in biofilm studies (Butterfield, et al., 2002, Camper et al., 1996, Banning, et al., 2003). The first objective in this :tudy was to determine if annular reactors, could be constructed and be successfully used to study biofilms. Microbes naturally existing in groundwater were expected to form a biofilm into which the foreign microbe would be introduced. The introduced microbe was a GFP-labeled E.coli 0157:H7 86-24. which could be easily monitored. The GFP label served as a marker proven to remain stable in viable, and viable but non-culturable microbes (Lower et al., 2000). GFP requires the presence of oxygen, but labeled cells grown under anaerobic conditions will develop fluorescence upon exposure to air (Banning et al., 2003). The reactors used were not uniformly aerated, but could be considered aerobic overall since no attempts were made to create an anaerobic environment. GFP plasmids have been suitable cellular markers, but not necessarily viability indicators for use under non-selective, anaerobic, or nutrient-limited conditions. Since the use of GFP as a viability indicator in nutrient-limited conditions was a concern, PGR using E.coli 0157-specific primers was also performed on all samples collected in each experiment. This was then compared to the results obtained from monitoring E.coli 0157:H7 86-24 by microscopy. The survivability of E.coli 0157;H7 86-24 within a mierobial community was then monitored under various, yet ecologically relevant

30

In developm ent o f the test system , three m ajor com ponents w ere considered; bulk fluid, inoculum , and the substratum . In an attem pt to m im ic the conditions that are found at the groundw ater-w ell interface, well w ater was used as the bulk fluid. This was also

31

used to provide a source of naturally-existing microbes that were present in a private, untreated well located in Ontario. Water was taken from this well, and also tested for its chemical properties using the general chemical tests available through PSC Environmental lab services. It was expected that the low nutrient content in the bulk fluid should create oligotrophic conditions, which in turn would discourage planktonic growth (White et al., 1999). The inoculum will have an influence on biofilm formation. Several studies have shown that the order of inoculation will create different biofilm compositions (White et al., 1999). Since wells will have some level of biofouling once drilled, the annular reactors reflected this order. The biofilm was first given some time to develop with just the microbes naturally existing in the bulk fluid. The foreign microbe, E.coli 0157:H7 86-24, was added after the initial biofilm development. The amount of time required for development can vary greatly, so the development time was determined experimentally. A thin layer of film was seen once the reactors were run for approximately two days. The slide was examined under a microscope, and it was observed that although most of the film visible to the eye was due to mineral deposits, bacteria were also present. As mentioned. Camper, et al.'s work found that slowly-grown coliforms survived in their reactors at the highest concentrations (Camper et al., 1996). The lowest initial growth rate of 0.05/h enabled the coliforms to compete with the bacteria forming the initial biofilm. Since a pathogen in the environment would have been exposed to the stress of the environment (sunlight, loss of nutrient-rich environment) before reaching groundwater, it might be expected that the stress placed on the microbe during transport will aid in its ability to survive once it encounters a groundwater biofilm, because it is

32

expected that its grow th rate w ould be slow. E .coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 86-24 w as grow n for 24 hours to ensure bacterial growth w as past a log phase o f growth, and had entered its stationary phase. The cells, in this die-off phase, were used to aid in its ability to survive in the biofilm . Substratum can have a dram atic effect on the biofilm form ation, succession, and desquam ation. Scheuerm an et al.. looked at substratum topography on bacterial adhesion. In their discussions w ith industry, it was believed that biofilm s preferred to attach to rough surfaces. It was thought that perhaps this was due to higher surface area, protection from shear forces, and chemical changes that cause preferential physicochem ical interactions. The Scheuerm an study created grooves w ithin a hom ogeneous silicon coupon 10, 20, 30, and 40 um deep. They unexpectedly found that the initial rates o f attachm ent for the bacteria tested were independent o f the grooves, w here only m otile organism s w ere found at the bottom s o f the grooves. They did find that the initial rate o f attachm ent was influenced by a higher fluid velocity, and concluded that attachm ent has a greater influence based on the transport from the bulk phase, onto the substratum (Scheuerm an et al.. 1998). Several other studies have also m ade a sim ilar finding, w here biofilm thickness is shown to increase with substrate loading, and not strongly affected by shear stress (Peyton. 1995. Soini. et al. 2002). Cam per, et al., operated annular reactors using oligotrophic conditions to look at the influence o f growth conditions and substratum on long-term persistence o f coliform s in m ixed-population biofilm s. They found that larger num bers occurred w hen m ild steel w as used instead o f polycarbonate (Cam per et al., 1996). This is an interesting finding since som e w ells have well screens that are made o f stainless steel. In this lab study.

33

glass slides were primarily used as the substratum due to its availability and ease of sample analysis. Stainless steel coupons were also used, but later abandoned. The annular reactors consistently had the greatest amount of growth near the water/air interface. This resulted in a concentrated strip of biofilm near the top of the slide. Depending on the conditions used, biofilm growth on the remainder of the slide varied greatly. The heterogeneity of the biofilm on the slide was an important observation, which could not be observed on the stainless steel coupons because the sample had to be disrupted to be viewed. Only a limited number of spaces were available in the reactors, so analysis was only performed using the glass slides.

3.1.1 Annular reactor design & conditions

To study biofilms, laboratory and field reactors are commercially available. An annular reactor has an outer stationary cylinder with an inner rotating cylinder. The speed is set to mimic the liquid/surface shear of the water system in which the investigator is interested. The design of the reactor used in this study was loosely based on a paper by Lawrence et al., 2000 which compared the performance of a home-made and commercial reactor. Both systems compared similarly to each other with respect to biofilm development (Lawrence et al., 2000). Annular Reactors were primarily designed and constructed as a cost-saving measure. Two reactors were built using 1.2L translucent, polypropylene jars (Canadawide Scientific, 582-100-14). Two holes were drilled slightly smaller than the

34

tubing (M asterflex 96400-16) to ensure a tight fit once the tubing was pushed through. The tubing w as then sealed with a w aterproof adhesive (Henkel 'S tik 'n S eal'), and a plastic lid that was sm aller than the ja r was used as the slide holder. Eight wire clips were purchased (3M ) and attached sym m etrically to the side o f the sm aller ja r lid. The clips w ere attached using a com bination o f tw o-sided foam tape, and sealant. A hole was drilled in the center o f the larger ja r lid, and was fixed such that the ja r lid could hold the slides. A 115 rpm geared m otor (Efton Science) was fixed using m etal screws. The m otor w as run by attaching it to a 12V pow er adapter. The speed o f the inner cylinder was chosen based on the only m otor available.

The home-made reactors had similar specifications to a BST (BioSurface Technologies Corporation) Biofilm Annular Reactor, used for biofilm growth and control studies using field-like conditions. More specifically, their reactor was designed to study biofouling, and treatment evaluation, where fluid shear and bulk fluid residence time are easily controlled. It is also suitable for pathogenic biofilms. This reactor can hold 1 L of fluid, and
2 0

slides. It is made of stainless steel, polycarbonate, or glass, and can run at a

rotational speed of 20-288rpm (Websource: http://www.imt.net/~mitbst/reactors.html).

The hom e-m ade reactor designed for this study w as set up to receive well w ater that w as stored in 20L carboys (Labcor. A -06082-50). and held at 4°C. The w ater was pushed into the reactors using a peristaltic pum p (M asterflex), at a flow rate o f between 0.5-0.8m L/m in., or a dilution rate o f 0.48/hr. This was used since Cam per et al., 1996 determ ined a dilution rate o f 0.5/h to be m ost favorable to survivability o f coliform s in a m ixed-population biofilm (Cam per et al.. 1996). A fter the first trial how ever, a tim er was used to turn the pum p o ff and on at 12 hour intervals. This was done to cut the am ount o f w ater used dow n substantially over the test period. The well-w ater was difficult to obtain, and w as therefore used sparingly. B efore use, all com ponents o f the reactor were sterilized. A pre-trial run was perform ed to test the reactor. Both reactors were first sterilized by soaking them in bleach for tw o hours. The lid and clips were rinsed with 100% ethanol. O lder tubes w ere used as the w aste drainage tubes. These w ere scrubbed using a brush, and soaked in bleach. The entire reactor and tubes w ere then rinsed and flushed with milHQ water. The reactors were sterilized in this m anner for each experim ent. The carboys were initially cleaned using w ater and sodium bicarbonate ju st before w ater collection. The carboys w ere washed in between experim ents using diluted bleach, follow ed by thorough rinsing w ith m illiQ water.

3.1.2 Water Source

Well water that was used in the experiment came from a well in Acton, from the Halton district. It was drilled using conventional rotary drilling on June 3,1981. The well has since been used as the only water supply for a single household.

A five inch hole was drilled, and water was found at 78-90 feet. Steel casting was used for the first 26 feet. The remaining depth was left as an open hole. The pumping rate was determined to be eight gallons per minute, with a static level of nine feet. The water was clear at the end of pumping. This well was not treated before, or during use. The town of Acton also receives its municipal water from groundwater wells that are treated for removal of naturally occurring iron and manganese. Ultraviolet radiation and chlorine is used to make the water safe for consumption (The New Tanner, 2004).

The concentrations are also com pared to concentrations o f chem icals obtained from published results o f W alkerton w ater shortly after the E.coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 outbreak. A lthough the outbreak was largely due to the lack o f chlorination o f water, it is also true that E.coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 w as able to persist in the subsurface long enough to cause disease. It is therefore useful for this study, which is perform ed using subtle nutrient differences, to look at the concentrations o f various nutrients present at the tim e o f this recent outbreak.

E.coU 0 1 5 7 ;H 7 86-24 w as used as the foreign m icrobe. It w as used because it has the green fluorescent protein (GFP) m arker incorporated into its chrom osom e. GFP w as originally isolated from Coelenterates (e.g. jellyfish), and can be expressed in both prokaryote and eukaryote systems. W hen GFP is exposed to blue light, it fluoresces green. It will fluoresce w ithin hours o f its production, m aking it an excellent reporter. (So et al. 2002, B ilge et al., 1996). E. coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 T86-24 was obtained using E. coll JB I2 2 , carrying a GFP vector (pJB A 29), w hich w as provided by J.T. Trevors from the U niversity o f Guelph. This vector w as then transform ed into Escherichia coli 0157:H 7 86-24 (wild-type), provided by P. T arr (So, et al., 2002), where the GFP gene then became integrated into genom ic D N A. This transform ation experim ent, creating Escherichia coli 0 1 5 7 :H 7 T86-24, was perform ed by M itsuko Kanetani at Ryerson University.

3 .1 .4 E xperim ent overview

Once the reactors w ere designed, a m onth was spent testing to m ake sure they w ere operational. The well w ater w as brought from Acton, Ontario by car and stored at 4°C. To m inim ize use o f the w ater, the flow rate was kept to a m inim um . The lowest achievable flow rate for the pum ps that were available was 0.5m L/m in. D uring the initial testing, the pum ps w ould at tim es stop all together, so the pum p w as run at 0.5-

41

0.8mL/min. to minimize this problem. Timers were used to have the pump turn off and on every 12 hours. This was considered acceptable for the experiment because private well pumps are not constantly running. Since biofilm was developing at these low flow rates, and in unamended conditions, it was considered acceptable conditions to run the experiments. This enabled a reactor experiment to be performed in four weeks, using approximately lOL for each reactor. Four experiments were run (Table 6). The first took place for a duration of 25 days. Reactor 1 was amended with a final concentration of Ippm peptone, as was done in the Banning et al. study. Ten days were given for the biofilm in the reactors to develop. GYV-E.coli was grown for 24 hours in LB broth, spun and washed twice in TBS buffer. The cells were split between two microcentrifuge tubes, and the wet weight was recorded. The cells were then resuspended into well water taken from the reactors. Each reactor was then seeded with the E.coli 86-24-GFP and left to run as a batch reactor for 24 hours. The addition of E.coli 86-24-GFP was considered Day 1 for each experiment. Twenty-four hours after E.coli 86-24-GFP was added, the pump was run continuously at 0.5-0.8mL/min. The pump was also turned off when slides were being removed and replaced from the reactors. Trials 2-4 were performed in a similar maimer, except with the addition of the timer allowing for 12 hours off and on with the pumps. The following table summarizes the experiments run, and the duration of each.

M icro sco p y T ools

L ight m icroscopes can visualize structures that are in the scale o f a few m icrom eters. The biggest advantage using light m icroscopes is that one can visualize a specim en under natural conditions. The resolution limit is 0.16 uM in theory, but 0.3 uM in practice. M any tools now exist to aid in m icrobial studies that use m icroscopy to analyze results. For exam ple, various com ponents ot biotllm s can be visualized using a variety o f stains. N egative staining aides the detection and determination of EPS (H oppert, 2003). N ucleotide structure can be visualized by DAPl (4',6-diam idino-2phenylindole) staining. This requires chem ical fixation, therefore artificial alterations m ay occur. W hen thick specim ens need to be m onitored, confocal m icroscopy is the superior tool, although standard bright-field and fluorescence m icroscopes can still be used. B iofilm m ay be em bedded in an appropriate m atrix (gelatin, paraffin, resins), and

43

sliced to visualize a vertical axis to the surface. Stains with an affinity for exopolysaccharides will highlight the EPS. Other common techniques involve staining of cellular DNA (ethidium bromide, fluorescein), cells (propidium iodide),and EPS (calcofluor), that are visualized by using the appropriate filters (Hoppert, 2003, Davey and O'Toole, 2000). Confocal laser scanning microscopy has been successfully used for routine analysis of biofilms. Although it is an extremely powerful tool, one drawback is difficulty in quantifying results. Accuracy may also require the determination of bias that can be due to the experimenter's preferences (Webb et al., 2003).

3.2.1 Experiment overview using microscopy

GFP expression was monitored using a confocal scanning laser (Zeiss LSM 510), and epifluorescence microscopy (Zeiss HAL). The later was used more extensively, as it provided a simpler means of comparing GFP cells with the naturally occurring microbes. Since most of the trials produced fairly thin biofilms, observations with the epifluorescence microscope were clear. When sampling, the pumps were stopped, and the reactor was opened. A slide was then removed (in most trials, they were not replaced), and transferred to a container. One side of the slide was then scraped using a razor (always the side that was facing inwards), and gently rinsed with TBS (Tris buffered saline) buffer. This was then transferred with a transfer pipette, to a microcentrifuge tube and immediately stored at 20°C. These samples were later used to extract genomic DNA for analysis by PGR.

M olecu lar T o o ls
U nderstanding the com position and physiology o f microbial com m unities has

been greatly enhanced by the use o f techniques in m olecular biology. M ethods are typically based on detection and analysis o f nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. A nalysis o f D N A in particular is largely based on using polym erase chain reaction (PCR), com bined w ith a m eans o f visualization to interpret the results (Rochelle, 2001).

3.3.1 D N A isolation

B iofilm s developed throughout the experim ent were collected, and stored at -20°C . G enom ic DN A w as then isolated on tw o separate occasions, using tw o separate kits. M O B IO 's U ltraClean kit was first used, follow ing the m anufacturer's procedure. A second kit, Q iagen's D N easy Tissue kit, was used on majority o f the sam ples due to its sim pler procedure. This kit can isolate genom ic DNA from both gram -positive and gram -negative bacteria. The protocol for purifying genomic DNA from gram -positive bacteria w as used, because it would ensure that both gram -positive and gram -negative bacteria w ould be lysed.

PCR using 0157-specific primers

The various genetic factors which contribute to E.coli 0157:H 7's virulence are found on phage, plasmid and chromosomal genes (Law, 2000). E.coli strains expressing lipopolysaccharide 0-antigen, contain the rfb gene cluster. This cluster is made of 12 genes, including the fifth gene rfbE, which is specific to E.coli 0157:H7. Detection of 0157 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which amplifies part of rfbE, was developed for food-PCR diagnostics. Abdulmawjood el al. developed primers that have been tested on 155 strains of 0157 from a wide variety of sources. Internal amplification controls were developed to prevent false negative results, but these were not used in this study (Abdulmawjood et a l, 2002 & 2003). PCR primers were used as designed by Abdulmawjood et al.: Gi-0157-1 5'-CGA GTA CAT TGG CAT CGT G-3% G i-0 157-11 5'-ATT CGC CTG AAG CCT TTG-3'. The PCR reaction (25uL) contained 0.75 uL of each primer (lOpmol/uL), 2.5ul dNTP (lOmmol), 2.5uL of PCR buffer, 2.5uL of 25mM MgS0 4 , and 0.25uL optimase (Transgenomic). 13.75uL sterile milliQ water, and 2uL of genomic DNA. This reaction was performed using an MJ Thermocycler. The following program was used: 1 x 5 min. precycle at 95°C, 3Ox 30s at 95°C, 40s at 55°C, 45s at 72°C, and a final extension o f 72°C for 5 min. The PCR conditions were altered from the original paper to optimize them for use with DHPLC, and therefore using optimase as the enzyme.

3.3.3 PCR using 16S rRNA primers

It is very com m on to use 16S rRNA genes in deciphering m icrobial diversity. These genes control protein translation, and are therefore conserved w ithin various taxonom ic groups. Using 16SrRNA DNA is not w ithout difficulties, but offers great prom ise in detecting new species. A study done by Rivas et al., attem pted to identify m icroorganism s with universal prim ers containing sequence present in both Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes: 16S rRNA in Prokaryotes, and 18S rRNA in Eukaryotes. The paper described tw o areas where highly conserved sequences in all organism s w ould allow am plification for both prokaryotes (495bp). and eukaryotes (508bp). The area was nam ed the universal am plified ribosom al region (UARR). located in the V 6 . V7, and V 8 dom ains from rR N A (Rivas, et al., 2004). or position 909-1404 E.coli. and position 11341642 in S. cerevisiae. To reduce the specificity o f the primers, and therefore increase the likelihood o f am plifying m ore DNA from the various m icrobes present, degenerate prim ers w ere used. These are prim ers that are designed such that certain sites will incorporate a variety o f bases, instead o f specifically ju st one. This is also som etim es referred to as a wobble. N ew taxa w ith 16S rRN A sequences are revealing that some sequences are not universal to som e 16S rRNA prim ers previously used. As a result it is likely that current 16S libraries do not truly represent prokaryotic diversity. Baker et al., 2003, reassessed com m only used 16S rRN A prim ers and subsequently designed two new pairs for A rchaeal am plification. For am plification o f Prokaryotes, they recom m ended W atanabe et fl/.'s 16S rR N A prim ers. These prim ers give a 195 bp product, and in the V3 region

47

(Wantanabe et al., 2001, Baker et al., 2003). In their sequence analysis. Baker et al. found the longest string of completely conserved sequence is at E.coli position 788-798 (Accession# X80724). The rest are found in strings of less than four bases. This clearly shows that no primer can be a 100% match for all bacterial. The universal primer design is a compromise between trying to get universal complimentary sequence and all other aspects of primer design (primer-dimer formation, annealing temperature, G/C ratio). Poor complimentarity (especially at the 3' end) can lead to under representation of certain genotypes. To solve this, degenerate nucleotides have been used to gain `universal specificity'. These primers however can have a biased template-to-product ratio. Too much degeneracy can lead to amplification of non-target genes. Inosine was used in this study. They allowed no more than 25% total degeneracy and less than 10% inosine residues per primer to minimize bias introduced by this type of primer design. Bias is seen with different priming efficiencies causing differential amplification, interference by flanking primer regions, and different kinetics in the PCR reaction itself. No primer is truly universal, so the goal is to try to find an acceptable amount of bias (Baker et al., 2003). An interesting approach to 16S rRNA analysis is the use of nested primers. Boon et al., 2002 used this approach where they first performed PCR on broad bacterial groups. They looked at Bacteria, and alpha-proteobacteria, as well as for Actinomycetes, ammonium oxidizers, and methanotrophs. This was followed by a second PCR reaction using bacterial primers (P338F, P518R) (Boon et al., 2002). It must be noted that two successive PCRs can introduce an even greater bias if preferential amplification occurred. A nested approach, for WWTP aimed to standardize DOGE for group-specific I 6 S rRNA

48

PC R fragm ents. The first round had seven sets o f prim ers for different m icrobial groups. A second set w as used for 'Bacteria', to reduce and equalize the length o f the specific prim ers and to add a GC-clam p. This better revealed subtle changes within or differences betw een m icrobial com m unities (Boon et al.. 2000). Since there are so m any publications that use 16S prim ers for analysis, an extensive review o f literature on their use was not done. A strong attem pt was m ade to find prim ers that were carefully designed in the past that could be successfully used in this study.

3.3.4 Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC)

DHPLC or temperature-modified heteroduplex analysis (TMHA), development began
1 0

years ago when alkylated nonporous poly(styrene-divinlybenzene) particles o f

2um were developed. This was used as a stationary phase, and alkylammonium ions used in liquid phase to allow for size dependent chromatographic DNA separation. It was then discovered that heteroduplexes (DNA with a mismatch due to the presence of DNA sequence variation), and homoduplexes (DNA without a mismatch in the sequence), in partially denaturing conditions would have slightly different retention times on the column. The retention time is reduced for the heteroduplexes because the bridging molecule, triethylammonium acetate (TEAA), is not attracted as strongly to mismatched DNA. It is therefore not retained on the column as long as the homoduplex DNA fragments, when acetylnitrile is increased to compete with the TEAA. As a result, single nucleotide substitutions, deletions, and insertions can be detected in a 200-1000 bp PCR product, with sensitivity and specificity approaching 100%. (Premstaller & Oefner, 2003). One of the first publications to describe the use of DHPLC in an attempt to identify bacteria was by Hurtle et al. using universal primers. The results showed that they were able to distinguish 36 of the 39 bacteria examined which were identified by unique peak shapes (Hurtle et al., 2002) A variety of other studies have been published using DHPLC in microbiology applications. Some examples are mutation detection in quinolone-resistant Salmonella enterica, and Staphylococcus aureus (Harmachi-M'Zali et al., 2002), polymorphisms in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Cooksey et al., 2002), and

50

genotyping bacteria by M LST-D H PLC (m ultilocus sequence typing) (Shlush et a l, 2002). A nother study looked at fingerprinting bacteria in groundw ater and m ineral w ater used (D ew ettinck et al., 2001). This paper proposed the use o f PCR-D G G E as a rapid way to exam ine the bacterial quality o f waters. This might be superior over existing m ethods because the relationship betw een indicator organism s and pathogens has been questioned. Com m only used plating m ethods require long incubation periods. The proposed technique required resusitation was used by adding 1g/L o f peptone to some sam ples. The different w ater types exam ined were found to have different DNA fingerprints. A nother study, by Dom m an et al.. used 16S rRNA primers to identify bacteria in the urinary tract o f renal transplant recipients.

3.3.5 Experimental design using PCR and DHPLC

All PCR products were analyzed using DHPLC. The 0157 primers were examined in non-denaturing conditions (50°C), to look for the presence or absence of the 500 bp product. The conditions given in the paper did not produce any PCR product, so the reactions were re-optimized (see Section 4.3.2). Transgenomic's size ladder was used to determine the retention time of 500bp. Three primers were chosen for 16S rRNA analysis based on previous publications (Table 7), but ultimately only one set provided a PCR product of the correct size. The other primer sets did not produce any product, despite many attempts. Set 2 (Table 7) was used with the following PCR recipe: premix (dNTP, buffer, water) 21.25uL, 0.5uL forward primer, 0.5uL reverse primer, 0.25uL Amplitaq gold (Qiagen), 2.5uL DNA (final volume of 25uL). Touchdown PCR was done with an initial denaturing of 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 14 cycles (with a 0.5°C decrease in annealing temperature per cycle) of 95°C for 30 seconds, 58°C for 40 seconds, and 72°C for 45 seconds. The remainder of the PCR was 19 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 51°C for 40 seconds, and 72°C for 45 seconds, with a final extension of 72°C for 5 minutes. Analysis was done using DHPLC, in both denaturing and non-denaturing conditions. The optimal temperature was predicted using Transgenomic's Navigator software. Several melting profile calculations and temperature predictions are incorporated into an algorithm based on the `Fixman-Freire modification of the Poland method'. Several temperatures were used experimentally, and a final temperature is chosen based on these results.

1. The use o f constructed annular reactors to study biofilms.

Tw o annular reactors were run sim ultaneously during this study. The reactors w ere subject to four one-m onth trials, resulting in a total o f eight separate experim ents. In each experim ent, a naturally-occurring biofilm was given 2-3 days to develop before the single addition ot the foreign m icrobe occurred. After the first day o f running the reactors, a small film could be seen on the slides. Crystals, likely m inerals from the water, were quick to attach to the glass slide and within days m icrobes could be seen fonning a biofilm. W ith respect to overall biofilm appearance, all eight experim ents produced sim ilar biofilms. The slide had biofilm grow th sim ilar to w hat has been described in previous papers. There were areas o f patchy grow th, and areas o f open space especially towards the bottom o f the slide. This m ight have been the result o f less available oxygen towards the bottom o f the reactor. Since m inerals were observed as the first object that attached to the slides, it is possible that the naturally-occurring m icrobes introduced to the slides may have traveled there because they w ere initially attached to these minerals. They then becam e attached to the slide w ith them , and once on a larger surface, were able to colonize the slides. A concentrated strip o f biofilm always occurred near the top o f the glass slide, at the air-w ater interface. This was the area where the thickest biofilm developed.

In Figure 3A, microbes are shown attached and accumulating on the slides without the addition of any amendments. Figure 3B demonstrates that in the highest nutrient conditions used, Ippm peptone, biofilm growth is considerably greater, and with fewer open spaces. Filamentous bacteria are also observed.

A t the end o f the first experim ent, gram staining was perform ed on the final slide o f the reactor am ended with Ippm peptone. The staining revealed that the biofilm was dom inated by gram negative cocci seen in clusters, chains and pairs. Areas containing gram negative m icrobes are also seen but the shape o f their shape is not clear. Gram negative, filam entous bacteria stretch out from the clusters. Some gram negative, rod shaped bacteria can also be seen (Figure 4).

2. Integration o f a foreign m icrobe

E scherichia coli 0 1 5 7 ;H 7 T86-24 was grown in LB broth to a stationary phase o f growth, and used to seed the annular reactors. The reactors were then m onitored closely to observe its ability to integrate into the established biofilm. An average wet weight o f 0.0265 g was added to each reactor. A pellet w et weight o f 3 g is approxim ately equal to 3-4 X 10^ cells (Q iagen benchguide, 2005). Therefore, a single addition o f approxim ately 3 xlO 'cells w as added for each experim ent. Once the foreign microbe was added, sam pling occurred every few days. A total o f ten sampling slides were available in each experim ent to m onitor foreign m icrobe integration and persistence. The large am ount o f E.coli 86-24-G FP added did not accurately reflect the amount o f bacterial cells that m ight be expected to enter groundw ater in a natural environm ent. Analysis o f the waste stream showed that after the 24-hour batch period, E .coli 86-24-GFP washed out o f the reactors. It is likely that less E.coli 86-24-GFP could have been added to achieve biofilm integration. D espite this large addition, the fluid in the reactors always rem ained clear. This suggested that at no tim e did planktonie growth occur for E.coli 86-24-GFP. This was observed in every reactor condition used. Strong evidence o f an inability for E.coli 86-24-GFP to grow planktonically. was dem onstrated when replacement slides were added to the first experim ent. G FP-labeled E.coli 86-24-GFP was only added at the beginning o f the experim ent, and was never found to colonize any replacem ent slides added after its initial addition. Once E .coli 86-24-G FP was added to the reactor, it integrated itself into the existing biofilm . It was generally able to integrate throughout, and survive for up to two

57

weeks. Immediately after its addition, large numbers were seen to colonize the biofilm. Over time, fewer cells expressed the green fluorescent protein. Since its persistence could only be monitored by the presence of GFP, persistence beyond the use of this marker could not be established. It is possible that in the nutrient-limiting conditions, the cells may have become less active and therefore ceased to express GFP. This would be the case for cells becoming quiescent, as a mechanism for survival. Figure 5A and 5B were taken at the same location, but 5A was taken using regular light, and 5B under UV light. These images demonstrate the ability of E.coli 86-24-GFP to successfully integrate into the naturally-occurring biofilm. Here they are located near other microbes, and often near the mineral deposits.

3. N u trient effects on E .coli 86-24-GFP persistence

It w as found that w hen m ore nutrients were added, a greater am ount o f biofilm was observed. B iofilm grow th o f the natural m icrobes was greater, when 1 ppm o f peptone, or 100 ppm N O 3 w as added. Smaller am endm ents such as 0.2 ppm PO 4 and 10 ppm NO ] looked sim ilar to the unamended biofilm. It should be noted that the chemical test results o f the well w ater reported that there was less than 1 ppm o f PO4, and therefore the actual concentration was not known. The highest amount o f nutrients used was 1 ppm o f peptone added to the bulk fluid. This 'high-nutrient' experiment did not show evidence o f planktonie grow th, but did develop the thickest biofilm when com pared to all other experim ents. The naturally-occurring m icrobes also appear sm aller than the E.coli 86-24-GFP cells (Figure 5). The following figures are representative images that provide a pictorial sum m ary o f the eight experim ents perform ed in this study. All photos were taken using epifluorescence m icroscopy.

A. Image near top, under regular light. B. Same image as B, but under UV light.

Slides from the reactor amended with 1 ppm of peptone had more biofilm development overall, but after one week, the amount of GFP seen is similar to the unamended reactor (Fig.5). The naturally-occurring biofilm does appear to take a greater advantage of the increased nutrients than the foreign microbe. E. coli 86-24-GFP was only added once, whereas the naturally-occurring microbes existed in the bulk fluid, and was therefore constantly being added. The single dose of E.coli 86-24-GFP was used to reflect a single transportation event (e.g. transport into groundwater due to a heavy rainstorm). The success of the other microbes might have simply covered the E.coli
8 6

24-GFP decreasing its access to the outer layers where oxygen and nutrients would be more readily available. The next series of images (Figures 7-9) compare the detection of GFP in lOppm NO 3 (Figure 7), and 1OOppm NO 3 (Figure 8 ). Four days later, GFP can only be found at

60

1

OOppm N O 3 . The images show that E.coli 86-24-GFP integrates more successfully, and

with greater range on the slide, when the reactor is amended with 100 ppm NO3. This is an interesting observation, since both concentrations can be found in the natural environm ental. If both o f these conditions are considered oligotrophic, these results agree with current literature that lower nutrient conditions likely enhance foreign microbe persistence. However, the concentrations o f nitrate used in this study suggest that E.coli 86-24-GFP w ill do better under slightly nutrient-enhanced environments. The concentration o f 100 ppm N O 3 was chosen specifically because it has been found at this level in groundw ater throughout Canada (Environment Canada et al.. 2001).

In experim ents looking at phosphate effects, foreign microbe persistence was not enhanced, but the appearance o f the biofilm was affected. Figure lOA and lOB show E.coli 86-24-GFP clustering m ore closely than in experiments where no additional phosphate was added. The presence o f phosphate seems to have a negative effect on persistence, since the GFP was detected over a longer period when phosphate was not added to the reactor.

W hen adding phosphate and nitrate together, the foreign microbe initially appear to integrate very well with the biofilm on the slide, but even this combination experiences a quicker loss o f GFP than a reactor amended with only 100 ppm NO3. A similar result is seen when phosphate and less nitrate are used (Figure 12).

A unique observation in the reactor amended with 0.2 ppm PO 4 and 100 ppm NO 3 , was the inability of E.coli to grow right at the top of the water/air interface. A different filamentous-like microbe was seen to colonize this premium space, and E.coli 86-24-GFP was only found below it (Figure 13).

Figure 13: A (norm al light), & B (UV light), taken 4 days after E.coli 86-24-GFP was added, am ended with 0.2 ppm PO 4 and 100 ppm NO 3 . E.coli 86-24-GFP is doing well, but is not able to adhere to the biofilm or slide near the very top. There is good biofilm growth at the very top (16C), but no E.coli 86-24-GFP was found there (16D- UV light).

To add enhance the qualitative results, a quantitative result was also obtained. As previously described, one slide from each reactor was examined every time the reactor was sampled. Images were taken in an attempt to reflect the overall GFP fluorescence

67

found on the slide. Persistence was measured using the GFP marker to count the total number of E. coli 86-24-GFP cells as they fluoresced in the biofilm. The goal was to provide further evidence that certain amended reactors created conditions where the E.coli 86-24-GFP was able to fluoresce for a longer period of time, reflecting a stronger ability to persist. The number of E.coli 86-24-GFP cells counted in all images taken during a single sampling from one reactor was then averaged. When GFP was fading, the images represented nearly all E. coli 86-24-GFP still producing GFP. In the earlier samplings from the experiments, GFP was expressed over vast areas on the slide, so only representative images were taken. Slides with a lot o f GFP, also had a greater range of growth. The numbers were averaged for each day, regardless of where on the slide they were taken. The averages are given for the area o f the microscopic field of view, which was 12mm". With a slide that had too many E.coli 86-24-GFP to count, it was estimated to have at least 1000 cells in the image. The averaged numbers provide a numerical value for the persistence of E.coli 86-24-GFP in the biofilm under the different nutrient conditions. The tally might underestimate the E.coli 86-24-GFP on the slides in the initial few days, but becomes more accurate later in the trial when the E.coli 86-24-GFP numbers start to decline. The results of the tally are shown in Figures 14-17.

A com parison o f the graphs show that the average E.coli 86-24-GFP count increases to a m axim um at 7-8 days after its initial introduction for the unamended reactor, and all reactors amended only with nitrate. After this time, the numbers decrease. The longest duration is found using 100 ppm nitrate, where an average count o f 0.38 cells/m m - is found at Day 20 (Figure 15). This is twice the amount o f days that E.coli 86-24-GFP persisted when amended with only 10 ppm nitrate (10 days). The second experim ent that used 100 ppm nitrate, ended at 16 Days (due to the limitation of
1 0

sam pling slides), but the average count for that sampling day was 1.25 cells/mm^.

During this trial, the second reactor was also amended with phosphate. Despite also having
1 0 0

ppm nitrate, the presence of phosphate appeared to cause a more rapid decline

in E.coli 86-24-GFP cells. The average count at Day 16 for this experiment was 0.27 cells/mm" (Figure 17). The graphs provide evidence that E.coli 86-24-GFP counts rem ained higher over a longer duration, when the reactor was amended with
1 0 0

ppm

NO]. The reactors amended with phosphate, regardless of the presence or absence o f nitrate, all showed an initially large amount o f E.coli 86-24-GFP adherence followed by a rapid decline. The maximum average count at one week was also not observed. The lack o f this grow th peak was also absent when
1

ppm o f peptone was used.

It was interesting to observe that although far more E.coli 86-24-GFP attached itself to the peptone-amended biofilm, this did not seem to significantly increase the length o f tim e GFP was detected. The conditions with the least survivability were with 10 ppm N O ] amendments
(8

days), and with the addition o f 0.2 ppm PO 4 (9 days), and

the two com bined (9 days). The exact day that GFP could be detected is not truly represented because sam pling was not performed on a daily basis until an endpoint was

73

reached, but the general findings still hold true. The presence o f phosphate had an interesting visual effect appear on how E. coli 86-24-GFP clustered on the slide. It formed tighter groups than in the trials where no phosphate was added. Certain conditions also allowed E.coli 86-24-GFP to show variability for where it could be maintained on the slide (Figure 13). With 100 ppm NO 3 , the naturally-occurring biofilms occupied what was considered the premium location, the strip at the water-air interface. E.coli 86-24-GFP was observed to colonize below this area. In cases where the nutrient amendments were low, E.coli 86-24-GFP could be found in the water-air interface.

The ability to detect E. coli 0157:H 7 in drinking water can help assure that a particular w ater supply is safe for consumption. Since the nature o f this study was to obtain biofilm s eontaining E.coli 0157:H 7. an opportunity was also provided to monitor the detection o f E.coli 0157:H7 using molecular techniques. E.coli 0157:H 7 does not naturally produce GFP, so in this study one could compare persistence using the GFP marker, and detection based on DNA extraction and amplification. The results obtained using GFP were covered extensively in the previous section. This section details the results obtained using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by analysis using denaturing high perform ance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Previously designed PC R prim ers were selected to amplify part o f a gene specific to E.coli 0157:H 7. DNA was obtained by scraping the biofilm from a reactor slide, and extracting it using com m ercially available kits. The PCR product obtained was then analyzed using DHPLC. The following figure is a sample o f a chromatogram obtained. It includes six traces from T ransgenom ic's WAVE system, obtained under non-denaturing conditions. The bottom traee is Transgenom ic's size ladder. The top three traces show a DNA peak just after
6

m inutes, indicating a PCR product o f approximately 500 bp. This indicates

that the sam ples are positive for E.coli 86-24-GFP. The two other traces do not have a DNA peak, and therefore do not detect E.coli 86-24-GFP from the sample tested.

The results obtained using 0157-specific primers gave mixed results. In most cases, they failed to detect the presence of E.coli 86-24-GFP for the entire duration that GFP could be observed. Fifty percent of the time, E.coli 86-24-GFP could be detected 25 days longer by GFP than by PCR. Twenty-five percent of the PCR results were negative even when there was a strong amount of GFP seen using microscopy. The remaining twenty-five percent found the PCR to match the GFP results exactly. This lack of consistency was not a completely surprising finding, since PCR is inherently more complicated using genomic DNA extracted from an environmental sample. Inhibitory compounds, such as humic acids and heavy metals, can decrease polymerase activity (Rochelle, 2001). The PCR results do, however, demonstrate that using GFP as a tracer does work well. An actual endpoint cannot be established because it is unclear whether or not the E.coli 86-24-GFP died, or if its metabolic processes had slowed to the point where GFP was no longer produced.

To further investigate the biofilm using molecular techniques, 16S rRNA primers were also used. The different species of microbes present will amplify unique PCR products, reflected in base variation and product size. The same DNA samples were used as the template to amplify DNA from this conserved, but varied region of the genome. Collection and sequencing of the products obtained were considered beyond the scope of this project. The results were intended to obtain information on the amount of microbial diversity present, and to see if any conditions had an effect on the diversity of the

78

m icrobial population. Analysis o f 16S rRNA DNA products are often analyzed using DGGE, but in this study DHPLC was used due to its accessibility.

Figure 19: Selected chromatogram using 16S rRNA primers.

Figure 19 shows five traces from Transgenom ic's WAVE, obtained under partially-denaturing conditions. The first two traces are from the same trial (1 ppm peptone). The first and second trace reflects the sample obtained on Day 14 and Day 16, respectively. The third, fourth, and final trace, are from the same trial (100 ppm NO3),

obtained from Day 3, Day 5. and Day 7, respectively. The peaks reflect DNA sequence variation within the PCR product due to the amplification of DNA from different microbes in the sample. Examination o f the chromatograms suggests that the biofilm population changes over time. Since a large addition of E.coH 86-24-GFP was added to the reactor at the start o f each experiment, it is likely that the largest peak seen at 16 minutes, on the final three traces, is from the E.coli. This peak would not be expected on the earlier two traces, because two weeks after the experiment, the GFP m arker is no longer clearly seen when viewed using a microscope.

Figure 20: Selected chromatogram for 16S rRNA primers.

In Figure 20, the first two traces are from the same trial (0.2ppm PO 4 and 1OOppm NO 3 ). The first and second trace reflects the sample obtained on Day 4 and Day 10, respectively. The third trace is from a trial using 1OOppm NO 3 , and the final trace is a negative control. The phosphate amended results show two dominant peaks, whereas the trial with only nitrate added shows greater variation. This may indicate that there is greater species diversity when phosphate is not added to the reactor. The combination of 16S rRNA primers and DHPLC shows good potential as means of monitoring species diversity for laboratory-scale annular reactors. However, there are inherent limitations when using 16S rRNA primers. Differential amplification can also distort the original template ratio and therefore not accurately representing the microbial population. Also, a single microorganism can contain multiple copies of the

Discussion

The overall experimental design proved to work reliably throughout the fourm onth study. The m otor used to create rotation o f the slides did not fail, nor did any other com ponent o f the reactor fail. A couple o f slides did slip from the clip holding it in place, and this was rem edied by wrapping parafilm around the top edge o f the slide that made contact with the clip. The tubing began to develop some mineral build-up, but at no tim e w as the flow compromised. There was some concern about the consistency o f the flow rate. The slower flow rate was compromised to achieve a consistent flow rate due to lim itations o f the pump that was used in the study. A pump capable o f very slow flow rates should have been used, and would have allowed a constant flow, rather than alternating the flow o ff and on to conserve water. A further improvement on the reactor design w ould be to provide aeration o f the water, which would then allow better biofilm growth over the entire surface o f the slide. The challenge of counting GFP cells would have been more tedious, but the counts would also be more uniform throughout the slide. This unintended oxygen gradient, however, might be acceptable if the investigator does not want to create an oxygen-rich reactor which may not resemble the groundwater environm ent o f some w ell-water biofilms. This would be true for lab-studies interested

81

in understanding biofilms from deeper aquifers where oxygen would be less available. With respect to temperature, the bulk fluid was stored at 4°C, and the reactors were kept at room temperature. Odgen el a l, 2001, both found E.coli eounts to be higher when the temperature was lower. The lack of temperature control, and performing the experiments at a room temperature, could have negatively effected E.coli survival. Finally, light exposure for the reaetors was minimized to prevent algae growth. This was done by covering the reactors with cardboard boxes. No algae growth was seen on the walls of the reactor, or in the bulk fluid. It was demonstrated that biofilms develop as a response to nutrient limitations. In these conditions, the biofilm was only a few micrometers thick. When 1 ppm peptone was used in the bulk fluid, a thicker biofilm was observed. This might have then created a vertical gradient which then covered the E.coli 86-24-GFP that was introduced, thereby hindering its ability to persist. The less nutrient-rich conditions used, may have produced horizontal gradients, allowing the E.coli 86-24-GFP to have a better chance at survival. The time given for biofilm development might not have been adequate. Since groundwater microbes can have very slow growth rates, a biofilm a few days old cannot be expected to truly represent the established biofilm that a foreign microbe would encounter. However, the reactor did find that E.coli 86-24-GFP does exist in a biofilm in nutrient poor conditions, as previously stated by Davey and O'Toole, 2000. Also, as with Banning et al., 2003, E.coli 86-24-GFP was found to colonize all layers o f the biofilm and that groundwater biofilms do act as a reservoir. A highly evolved microbe is able to fulfill its energy requirements using the smallest amount of energy expended (Baron, 1996). It was not clear if this strain of

Conclusions

It is possible to construct home-made annular reactors that can successfully develop biofilms using well water as the bulk fluid. The reactors can tolerate up to Ippm of peptone without concern for planktonic growth. The reactors can also be successfully used as a laboratory model in studying nutrient effects on biofilms at environmentally-relevant concentrations. A GFP-traceable foreign microbe can be successfully introduced and establish itself for days to weeks within the biofilm. GFP can be used as a viability marker in nutrient-limited conditions. It was therefore also demonstrated that the persistence of a foreign microbe in nutrient-limited conditions is dependent on its ability to integrate within an existing biofilm. Nutrients, particularly nitrate, were used to amend the well-water in concentrations that have been detected in environmental samples. At 100 ppm NO3, E.coli 86-24-GFP showed the longest persistence. This was repeated twice during the study. Small amendments, and therefore, small increases in nutrients in the environment, could play a role in enhancing E.coli 86-24-GFP survivability. Extremely nutrient high water does not enhance E.coli 86-24-GFP survivability, likely due to an inability to compete with naturally-occurring microbes. The presence of other nutrients, phosphate in particular, can have an impact on the effects of nitrate on E.coli 86-24-GFP persistence.

84

This study also found that 0157-specific primers could successfully detect the presence o f E.coli 86-24-GFP, but it was not consistent. This was unfortunate, since this lab study had the luxury o f scraping the biofilm for direct analysis. This is unlike sam ples taken from a well, where it is only feasible to test the bulk fluid (the well water). The use o f DHPLC is limited by the ability to obtain good PCR product from 16S rRNA primers. Analysis o f the results obtained is limited because sequencing data was not obtained. As a result, this was only a preliminary study to look at the feasibility o f using DH PLC in an environmental microbiology study. These initial findings do show potential.

85

Recommendations
The experiments used in this study were largely exploratory. An attempt was made to use a variety of techniques that could be used together in studying well-water biofilms using a laboratory-based system. As such, a variety of recommendations can be made. With respect to the home-made reactor, its design could be refined to produce a more uniform biofilm, as mentioned in the discussion. The coupons used in this study were all glass slides, but the use of stainless steel coupons should be revisited since some wells contain stainless steel well screens, and this is a common place for biofouling to occur. Camper et al., 1996, found that larger numbers of microbes grew on this substratum than on glass, but this study was not able to confirm that finding. Other substratum, such as various types of rocks typically found in contact with groundwater, could be explored. With respect to biofilm development, it was only given a few days to develop. A series of experiments exploring biofilm age, by trying different development times and foreign microbe persistence, could be significant. As mentioned previously, the initial amount of E.coli 86-24-GFP added was probably far more than was necessary. Smaller amounts could be introduced to see if the same result would be obtained. Also, the growth rate of E. coli 86-24-GFP could have been further slowed, rather than simply relying on the cells to be in a stationary phase of growth. This ability of the cells to go from 24 hours in a nutrient-rich environment to the nutrient-poor reactor may not have allowed the cells to adequately adapt to these different conditions. A better transition

86

could be attem pted, and greater emphasis on this, as in Camper et a /.'s 1996 study, was needed. In the case o f nutrient effects, many permutations could be performed. There is a great possibility in exploring the potential effects o f other pollutants, including heavy metals and pesticides, using the general system outlined in this study. Such experiments could test the finding o f Artz and Kill ham. 2002. who found that E.coli 0157 survival decreased with increasing copper and protozoa counts in field studies. As mentioned earlier, to test the GFP marker, it might have been useful to change the nutrient-poor reactors to m ore nutrient-rich conditions in an attempt to resuscitate the E.coli 86-24GFP. I f GFP was seen after an attempt at resuscitation, it would indicate that the persistence o f E.coli 86-24-GFP was even further enhanced by biofilm integration. If not, it would suggest that the biofilm only temporarily acts as a means of foreign microbe persistence. The m olecular techniques used in this study were not completely exhausted. The 0157-specific prim ers were only moderately successful in detecting E.coli 86-24-GFP in the biofilm. A ttem pts to detect E.coli 86-24-GFP from both biofilm and water samples (e.g. reactor effluent), could be done. Collection by membrane filtration followed by PCR analysis could bave been performed. The use the internal controls designed by Abdulmawjood et al., 2002. could also have been implemented. The use o f 16S rRNA was not complete. Although great care was taken to choose well-tested prim ers, it was difficult to obtain any product. For the PCR that did produce DNA fragments, they could have been collected and sequenced for DNA comparison. Having sequence data that could be clustered, would also provide insight into the diversity o f the species present. The experimental design provides the means o f

87

developing a biofilm of interest, to obtain its genomic DNA, and sequence PCR products to look for species that do not grow well using traditional culturing techniques. To further test the technologies used in this study, the use of DHPLC could have also been compared with DGGE to explore the pros and cons of each technique. Lastly, a confocal laser scanning microscope was used throughout the study, yet the results obtained were not included in this final report. The goals set out in this study were achieved using an epifluorescence microscope. Since the biofilm was very thin, sectioned images of the biofilm was not necessary. However, the use of this tool could also create an even more in depth analysis of foreign microbe persistence, by looking at other characteristics of the biofilm. Staining techniques to compare the percent o f the slide occupied by EPS, and other microbes with the GFP marker could further aid in the understanding of how a foreign microbe uses biofilm integration as a means of persistence.
