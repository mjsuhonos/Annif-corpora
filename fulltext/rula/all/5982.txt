ii. ABSTRACT
   This   Major   Research   Paper   (MRP)   is   a   research-creation   project   that   explores  the  role,  impact  and  influence  of  music  on  human  communication.   More  specifically,  this  MRP  investigates  the  way  that  music  can  assist  in   cognitive  comprehension  and  information  retention  in  individuals  with  varied   forms  of  memory  loss  and  considers  the  ways  that  music  can  be  used  to   assist  in  aiding  verbal  memory  and  communicating  emotion.  It  also  offers   insight   on   methods   that   could   be   utilized   to   further   study   this   area   of   research.  As  a  research-creation  project,  this  MRP  includes  three  original   musical  compositions  (Composition  A1,  Composition  B2,  and   Composition C3)  that  were  developed  in  response  to  the  scholarly  literature  on  this  topic.   The   three   musical   compositions   that   have   been   produced   for   this   project   aim   to   communicate   emotion,   create   aesthetic   satisfaction,   and   aid   in

reinforcing  the  production  of  memories  based  on  the  information  presented   in   the   compositions.   The   composition   creation   process   was   informed   by   information   gathered   throughout   the   research   process   that   addresses   topics   such   as:   the   influence   of   music   on   individual   listeners,   emotion   in   music,   and   musical   techniques   that   can   be   used   to   successfully   communicate   ideas.   Beyond   the   scope   of   this   MRP/research-creation   project,   these   compositions   aim   to   serve   as   a   basis   for   testing   cognitive   function  in  individuals  with  varied  forms  of  memory  loss.  Detailed  discussion   of  the  design  of  the  musical  compositions,  including information  related  to   the   composition   influences,   and   a   breakdown   of   each   composition   are   included   alongside   the   MRP's   focus   on   scholarly   literature   and   research.   Furthermore,  the  potential  implications  of  these  compositions,  including  the   ways  they  could  assist  in  future  research,  is  discussed.

Introduction

Exploring   the   ways   that   music   communicates   and   the   way   it   can   assist  with  cognitive  comprehension  and  information  retention  is  the  focus   of  this  Major  Research  Paper  (MRP)  and  research-creation  project.  More   specifically,  this  project  responds  to  the  question:  How  can  music  be  used   as   a   communicative   tool   that   assists   in   aiding   verbal   memory   and   communicating   emotion?   The   objective   here   is   to   develop   critical   and   creative   insights   on   techniques   that   could   assist   in   the   development   of   music   capable   of   effectively   communicating   to   those   with   memory   deficiencies,  specifically  those  with  dementia  or  Alzheimer's  disease,  and   to  aid  them  in  memory  rehabilitation. For   this   project,   three   musical   compositions between   50   and   100   seconds   have   been   produced,   the   aim   being   to   communicate   emotion,   create  aesthetic  satisfaction,  and  aid  in  verbal  memory  of  the  information   presented  in  the  compositions.  The  creation  of  the  compositions  has  been   informed   by   information   gathered   throughout   the   research   process   that   speaks  to  issues  such  as:  the  influence  of  music,  emotion  in  music,  musical   factors  that  work  to  communicate  ideas,  and  more.  Beyond  the  scope  of  this   MRP,   these   compositions   aim   to   serve   as   a   basis   for   testing   cognitive   function  and  memory  in  individuals  with  varied  forms  of  memory  loss.   This   MRP   includes   three   primary   sections.   The   first   section   is   a   literature   review   that   explores   music   and   the   impact   it   has   on   emotion,

music's   relationship   to   advertising   and   consumer   behaviour,   musical   elements  that  contribute  to  music's  communicative  ability,  and  finally,  the   relationship   between   music,   memory,   and   information   retention.   Furthermore,   this   first   section   contributes   to   an   understanding   of   the   communicative   power   of   music   and   to   the   relationship   music   has   with   listeners.  The  second  section  is  comprised  of  a  detailed  discussion  of  the   design   of   the   accompanying   musical   compositions,   including   information   related   to   the   composition   influences,   and   a   breakdown   of   each   composition.   The   third   section   discusses   the   future   implications   of   these   compositions,  including  the  ways  they  could  assist  in  future  research,  and   how  they  could  be  tested  beyond  the  scope  of  this  MRP.  

1.1. About the Author: A Disclaimer
Before  going  further,  I  feel  it  is  critical  to  make  readers  aware  of  my   musical  background,  since  my  personal  experiences  related  to  music  have   informed  the  creation  of  these  compositions.  I  was  born  into  a  musical  family   and  from  a  young  age  was  heavily  involved  with  music.  My  grandfather  was   a   pianist,   my   mother   plays   clarinet   and   piano,   my   brother   plays   tenor   saxophone,   and   over   the   years   I   have   been   strongly   drawn   to   string   instruments.   At   age   14   I   received   my   first   guitar   and   began   composing   original  compositions  shortly  thereafter.  In  the  subsequent  years,  I  picked   up   piano,   ukulele,   and   beginner   knowledge   of   banjo   and   mandolin.   I   continue  to  write  and  compose  to  this  day  and  found  fortune  a  few  years   ago  when  a  composition  I  created  made  it  to  radio.  Though  I  love  all  genres

of  music,  I  am  most  familiar  with  rock,  pop,  and  folk  genres  that  typical  follow   four-chord   progressions,   often   with   an   accompanying   and   often   uncomplicated   melody.   I   am   self-taught,   with   intermediate   knowledge   of   musical  theory. Personal  curiosity  of  the  role  music  plays  in  communicating  emotion   and   the   ways   it   could   assist   in   communicating   messages   prompted   my   interest  in  this  research  area.  In  addition,  one  of  my  family  members  was   recently  diagnosed  with  vascular  dementia,  a  type  of  dementia  that  causes   memory   loss,   resulting   in   difficulty   speaking   and   remembering   everyday   tasks,  such  as  teeth  brushing.  After  hearing  of  the  issues  he  was  facing,  I   was  inspired  to  explore  music  as  a  communicative  medium,  particularly  the   influence   music   could   have   on   memory   and   information   retention.   As   a   result,  I  decided  to  create  original  compositions  that  aimed  to  communicate   ideas  about  everyday  activities,  in  hopes  that  they  could  one  day  be  used   to   assist   in   memory   recall.   The   lyrical   theme   of   these   compositions   was   inspired  by  my  family  member's  difficulty  with  everyday  tasks  (e.g.,  brushing   his  teeth,  shaving,  etc.)  and  a  detail  mentioned  in  Simmons-Stern,  Budson,   and  Ally's  (2010)  article  describing  the  daughter  of  an  Alzheimer's  patient   using  music  to  teach  her  father  about  current  news  stories.  This  piqued  my   interest  and  led  me  to  further  explore  this  area  of  research. The   three   compositions   developed   for   this   MRP:   (1)   have   been   composed  and  recorded  solely  by  myself,  (2)  involve  instruments  that  I  have   experience  playing,  (3)  are  expressed  and  explained  through  beginner  to

intermediate   language   of   musical   notation   and   theory,   (4)   involve   my   interpretation   of   content   found   in   the   research,   which   has   informed   the   creation  of  the  compositions,  (5)  fall  within  the  pop,  rock,  and/or  folk  genres   popular  in  North  America,  and  (6)  are  rooted  in  Western  music  culture.  As   a   result,   these   compositions   are   necessarily   informed   by   my   own   experiences   of   musical   genres,   my   own   familiarity   with   certain   types   of   instrumentation,   and   my   personal   theoretical   and   practical   knowledge   of   music.  At  the  same  time,  the  compositions  are  also  creative  distillations  of   complex   ideas.   My   broad   objective,   then,   has   been   to   draw   on   scholarly   research   to   create   effective   communication   tools   capable   of   reaching   listeners  whose  ability  to  remember  everyday  routines  has  been  impaired   and   who,   perhaps   by   having   catchy   melodies   stuck   in   their   head,   might   become  empowered  to  rediscover  their  abilities  to  perform  everyday  tasks.     

2. Research Questions
Examining  the  ways  that  different  musical  styles  and  techniques  can   influence  and  affect  individuals  could  assist  with  understanding  the  potential   impact   that   music   has   on   effectively   communicating   to   listeners.   This   research  project  addresses  and  explores  the  ways  that  music  can  influence   cognitive  comprehension  and  information  retention,  aiding  verbal  memory   and  communicating  emotion,  and  was  guided  by  the  following  questions:

1.   2.  

Is   music   a   valuable   tool   to   use   when   attempting   to  

communicate  complex  ideas,  such  as  emotion  or  specific  tasks? Which  musical  traits  and  techniques  (tempo,  timbre,  musical  

mode,   repetition,   etc.)   contribute   to   cognitive   comprehension,   information  retention  and  the  aiding  of  verbal  memory  in  individuals   with  varied  forms  of  memory  loss? Responding  to  these  questions  has  assisted  in  my  understanding  of  the   impact  that  music  has  on  communicating  complex  ideas  and  has  allowed   me  to  develop  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  most  effective  methods  to  use   when   communicating   with   individuals   through   music.   The   three   compositions  I  have  developed  during  this  research-creation  project  are  the   products  of  this  exploration  of  musical  affordances.

Literature Review

In   the   early   twentieth   century,   music   psychologists   proposed   a   complex  way  of  understanding  musical  pitch,  resulting  in  a  stronger  focus   on   music   education   and   sparking   discussions   and   studies   by   theorists   across   the   globe   (Révész,   1954;   Welleck   and   Baker,   1926).   This   section   offers  a  review  of  the  literature  that  has  been  developed  since  then,  focusing   specifically   on   three   main   areas   of   research:   (1)   music   as   a   source   of   emotion   and   meaning,   (2)   music   as   a   communicative   tool,   and   (3)   the   relationship  between  music,  memory,  and  information  retention.

3.1. Music as a Source of Emotion and Meaning
This  section  of  the  literature  review  explores  music  as  a  source  of   emotion  and  meaning.  More  specifically,  it  discusses  and  reviews  scholarly   works  that  speak  to  the  ways  human  emotion  is  influenced  and  affected  by   music,   and   the   ways   that   emotional   meaning   is   created   through   musical   engagement.     Music  is  a  communicative  tool  that  can  be  used  to  evoke  emotions   in  listeners  (Koelsch,  2010;  Panksepp  and  Bernatzky,  2002).  Panksepp  and   Bernatzky   (2002)   discuss   the   influence   music   has   on   the   brain   with   an   emphasis   on   the   effect   music   has   on   emotion.   They   focus   on   the   ways   musical  information  can  influence  and  speak  to  various  parts  of  the  brain   and   the   emotional   systems   present   within   it   (Panksepp   and   Bernatzky,   2002).   Panksepp   and   Bernatzky   (2002)   explain   that   the   degree   to   which   music   influences   emotion   differs   in   individuals   and   is   likely   a   result   of   a   combination  of  many  complex  factors  that  are  still  not  fully  understood.  In   their  discussion  of  the  relationship  between  music  and  emotion,  they  draw   attention  to  a  gap  in  research  on  music  as  an  affective  medium,  suggesting   that  investigating  this  area  of  research  could  eventually  teach  us  "how  music   might  be  used  more  effectively  in  our  educational  and  therapeutic  initiatives"   (Panksepp  and  Bernatzky,  2002,  p.  152).   Illie  and  Thompson  (2006)  discuss  music  as  a  source  of  emotion  and   meaning,  along   with   the   concept   of   `prosody,'   which   "refers   to   the   use   of   intonation   (pitch   variation)   and   rhythm   (stress   and   timing)   in   speech,   as  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

14  

distinct  from  verbal  content"  (p.  319).  They  explain  that  the  pairing  of  music   and   prosody   is   what   works   to   communicate   emotional   meaning   (Illie   and   Thompson,  2006).  Similarily,  Juslin  and  Laukka  (2001)  examine  the  impact   vocal  intonation  and  acoustic  cues  have  on  the  emotion  a  listener  perceives   a   musical   composition   to   be   communicating.   They   suggest   that   vocal   expression,  the  emotion  and  intensity  present  in  one's  speech,  influences   the   perceived   emotion   of   what   is   being   stated   (Juslin   and   Laukka,   2001)   and   offer   evidence   suggesting   the   importance   of   vocal   expression   when   attempting  to  communicate  a  specific  emotion. Although,   as   mentioned   earlier,   this   paper   primarily   focuses   on   Western   musical   traditions,   there   is   evidence   of   universal   musical   traits   related  to  emotion  and  meaning.  Accordingly,  Fritz  et  al.  (2009)  investigate   whether   similar   emotions   are   universally   experienced   when   encountering   certain  types  of  musical  compositions,  considering  the  presence  of  emotion   in   music   on   a   cross-cultural   level.   The   authors   explore   whether   the   importance   of   emotional   expression   in   music   is   universal   among   other   cultures,   using   a   native   African   population   and   a   Western   population   as   points  of  comparison  (Fritz  et  al.,  2009).  The  results  of  Fritz  et  al.'s  (2009)   study  reveal  that,  in  addition  to  the  Western  population,  the  non-Western   population  experiences  the  musically-induced  emotions  of  happy,  sad,  and   scared/fearful  when  listening  to  different  types  of  music.  Their  discovery  is   an   important   factor   to   consider   when   creating   compositions.   Since   these   are  the  emotions  evidenced  to  be  universal,  these  are  the  three  emotions  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

15  

my  compositions  aim  to  communicate.  If  future  research  in  this  area  allows   for   the   testing   of   these   compositions, it   will   be   important   to   consider   the   universal  perception  of  emotions  by  other  cultures.  

3.1.1. Music, advertising, emotion, and behaviour.    
Existing  literature  and  research  supports  the  notion  that  music  is  a   source  of  emotion  and  meaning,  and  emphasizes  the  importance  of  music   as  a  communicative  tool.  Similar  views  of  the  power  of  music  arise  in  studies   that  focus  on  music,  advertising,  emotion,  and  behaviour.     Studies   within   the   field   of   advertising   contribute   to   a   broader   understanding   of   the   impact   music   used   in   advertisements   has   on   the   emotions  and  cognitive  functions  of  individuals,  serving  as  a  basis  ­  and   point  of  comparison  ­  for  understanding  the  influence  it  has  on  individuals   outside  of  the  realm  of  advertising.  In  advertising,  music  has  been  shown  to   be   "an   affective   background   component   that   causes   attachment   to   the   product   without   the   cognitive   involvement   of   the   viewer"   (Scott,   1990,   p.   224).   Gorn   (1982)   focuses   on   understanding   music's   influence   on   behaviour  in  the  realm  of  advertising  by  discussing  the  impact  that  music   used   in   advertising   has   on   consumer   behaviour.   His   study   demonstrates   that   subjects   are   more   likely   to   choose   an   advertised   product   when   it   is   paired  with  aesthetically  pleasing  music,  cementing  the  notion  that  music   does   indeed   have   an   impact   on   consumer   behaviour   (Gorn,   1982).   Awareness   of   the   role   that   aesthetic   appeal   plays   in   music,   and   the   influence   it   has   on   the   perception   of   the   product   or   message   paired   with  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

16  

said  musical  piece,  is  important  to  consider  when  creating  a  composition   composed   to   communicate   a   specific   message.   Gorn's   (1982)   work   was   met   with   critiques   later   that   decade   when   research   by   Kellaris   and   Cox   (1989)  replicated  Gorn's  (1982)  experiment,  but  yielded  opposing  results.   The   divide   between   the   results   of   these   two   studies   suggests   that   there   must  be  other  factors  related  to  music's  ability  to  influence  listeners,  that   extend   beyond   the   realm   of   strictly   stylistic   musical   preference   and   the   aesthetic  appeal  of  a  musical  piece.   Alpert   and   Alpert   (1990)   build   off   previous   research   in   this   area   (Gorn,   1982)   by   seeking   to   uncover   the   relationship   between   music,   emotion   and   behaviour.   Their   experiments   investigate   the   link   between   music  and  consumer  behaviour,  where  various  products  are  presented  to   subjects  in  their  study  accompanied  by  different  styles  of  music  (Alpert  and   Alpert,  1990).  Similar  to  Gorn's  (1982)  initial  study,  the  results  of  Alpert  and   Alpert's   (1990)   experiment   suggest   that   music   can   influence   individual   behaviour,  supporting  the  role  of  music  as  a  communicative  medium.   Other   discussions   surrounding   music,   emotion   and   behaviour   consider  emotional  responses  to  music  and  the  influence  music  can  have   on   behaviour.   Morris   and   Boone's   (1998)   study   investigates   music's   influence   on   both,   purchase   intent   and   emotional   response.   Their   experiment  yields  interesting  results.  In  contrast  to  the  study  by  Alpert  and   Alpert  (1990)  which  suggests  music  has  an  influence  on  purchasing  intent,   Morris  and  Boone's  (1998)  study  suggests  otherwise.  They  note  that  there

are   "no   differences   in   brand   attitude   and   purchase   intent,   however   on   emotional   response   six   out   of   the   12   advertisements   showed   significant   differences  between  the  music  and  no-music  groups."  (Morris  and  Boone,   1998,  p.  518).  Again,  opposing  research  results  in  this  field  draw  attention   to  a  gap  in  an  ability  to  understand  what  makes  music  so  persuasive  and   impactful.   Ilie   and   Thompson   (2006)   critique   the   separation-based   research   practices  used  by  researchers  like  Gorn  (1982)  and  Kellaris  and  Cox  (1989),   that  regard  music  as  an  independent  affective  entity  that  works  in  specific   ways   regardless   of   the   context   in   which   it   is   studied.   Ilie   and   Thompson   (2006)   suggest   that   "the   methodology   of   separating   [music]   syntactically   [has  led]  to  procedures  that  negate  the  complex  functionality  of  the  music"   (p.  225),  noting  that  studies  such  as  those  performed  by  Gorn  (1982)  fail  to   consider  the  importance  of  the  relationship  between  other  factors  (visuals,   social  context,  etc.).  To  fully  understand  music's  role  as  a  communicative   medium  that  influences  emotion  and  facilitates  meaning,  it  is  important  to   consider  the  multiple  factors  at  play  in  any  musical  composition.

3.2. Music as a Communicative Tool
This  section  explores  various  facets  of  music's  communicative  ability   by   examining   the   relationship   between   music   and   classical   conditioning   theory,   and   the   importance   of   aesthetic   characteristics   and   musical   elements  in  compositions.

3.2.1 Classical conditioning theory.    
Bierley,   McSweeney,   and   Vannieuwkerk   (1985)   focus   on   classical   conditioning,  a  theory  that  was  first  put  forth  by  Pavlov  in  1927.  They  explain   that   classical   conditioning   is   a   process   that   "occurs   when   an   arbitrary   stimulus  (the  conditioned  stimulus,  or  CS)  predicts  some  other  stimulus  (the   unconditioned   stimulus,   or   US).   After   several   trials,   a   response   (the   conditioned   response,   or   CR)   to   the   CS   develops"   (Bierley,   McSweeney,   and  Vannieuwkerk,  1985,  p.  316).  In  other  words,  classical  conditioning  is   a  theory  that  concentrates  on  associative  relationships  that  form  between   stimuli.   Much   of   the   discussion   concerning   the   relationship   between   classical   conditioning   and   music   relates   to   advertising.   Apaolaza-Ibáñez,   Zander   and   Hartmann   (2010)   discuss   this   notion,   explaining   that   in   advertising   "classical   conditioning   implies   that   pairing   a   product   (neutral   stimulus)   with   a   well-liked   piece   of   music   (unconditioned   stimulus)   will   produce  an  association  between  the  two,  and  therefore  a  preference  for  the   product  (a  conditioned  response)"  (p.  3807).  The  conditioned  relationship   that   can   be   created   between   a   brand   or   product   and   a   musical   piece   is   suggestive   of   the   power   that   music   has   on   creating   deep-rooted   connections   with   a   listener.   In   the   mind   of   the   listener,   an   association   is   made  between  the  melody  and  tone  of  a  song,  and  the  ideas  those  musical   elements   represent.   As   a   result,   music   is   an   extremely   viable   tool   to   use   when  attempting  to  communicate  ideas  to  individuals  with  varied  forms  of   memory  loss.

3.2.2. Musical elements and aesthetic appeal.  
Another   facet   of   music's   communicative   ability   is   the   aesthetic   appeal   that   is   present   within   a   musical   piece.   The   aesthetic   appeal   of   a   musical  composition  is  often  what  causes  listeners  to  like,  or  dislike,  a  song.   Ockelford   (2006;   2009;   2013)   speaks   about   the   mechanisms   at   play   that   cause  a  listener  to  feel  a  certain  way  when  listening  to  a  piece  of  music.   When  there  is  repetition  present  in  a  musical  piece,  for  example,  there  is  a   constant  sense  of  expectation  being  met,  leading  to  a  feeling  of  aesthetic   satisfaction  and  resolution  (Ockelford  2006;  2009;  2013).  Conversely,  if  a   listener  does  not  like  a  song,  or  is  left  feeling  unsatisfied  after  hearing  it,  it   may  cloud  their  judgment  of  the  message  being  portrayed  in  the  song.  As   evidenced   through   other   research   (Scherer,   2004),   music   influences   and   guides   our   emotions.   When   listeners   enjoy   a   song   that   is   included   in   a   media  piece  there  is  the  potential  for  enhancement  of  the  communicative   ability  of  the  song,  so  it  is  important  to  understand  the  musical  factors  at   play  in  a  musical  composition.   In   addition   to   repetition   (Ockelford   2006;   2009;   2013),   rhythm   is   another   factor   at   work   in   a   musical   piece   that   a   listener   may   find   aesthetically   appealing,   contributing   to   music's   ability   to   connect   with   individuals.  Repp  (2005)  speaks  of  sensorimotor  synchronization  which  is   related  to  the  human  ability  to  hear  and  feel  rhythm,  noting  that  "temporal   expectations"   are   created   as   a   result   of   "internal   synchronization"   when   music   is   heard   (p.   969).   Repp's   (2005)   article   offers   complex   insight,  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

20  

considering   the   relationship   between   cognitive   function,   motor   skills,   and   sensorimotor   synchronization.   When   discussing   previous   studies,   Repp   (2005)  notes  that  there  is  evidence  of  a  relationship  between  tapping  and   auditory  sensory  memory.  Findings  such  as  these  allude  to  the  importance   of   rhythm   in   a   musical   piece,   and   the   role   it   can   play   in   assisting   with   memory  and  enhancing  cognitive  function.   In   line   with   Repp   (2005),   Patel   and   Daniele   (2003)   discuss   the   evolution  of  musicality  in  humans  with  specific  emphasis  on  an  exploration   of  rhythm,  examining  the  relationship  between  musical  rhythm  and  linguistic   rhythm.  In  a  later  work,  Patel  (2006)  questions  the  capability  of  animals  to   produce  rhythm,  further  exploring  the  subject  of  innate  beat  perception  and   synchronization  in  individuals.  Works  such  as  those  by  Patel  (2006),  Patel   and  Daniele  (2003)  and  Repp  (2005)  offer  insight  on  music's  communicative   capacity  and  help  us  understand  the  musical  factors  that  contribute  to  it.  If   all  humans  have  an  inherent  sense  of  rhythm,  for  example,  this  could  be   why  we  find  musical  pieces  with  steady  rhythms  so  aesthetically  pleasing.   Being   aware   of   the   aesthetic   satisfaction   that   can   result   from   a   steady   rhythm   is   crucial   to   understand,   as   rhythm   is   a   critical   element   of   any   musical  composition.   Other   literature   supports   the   importance   of   rhythm   in   musical   experience,   suggesting   that   rhythm   acts   as   a   tool   to   structure   a   musical   piece   (Calvert   and   Tart,   1993;   Moussard,   Bigand,   Belleville,   and   Peretz,   2012).   Moussard,   Bigand,   Belleville,   and   Peretz   (2012)   explain   that   "the

21  

rhythm...can   give   cues   for   the   lyric's   structure   (such   as   the   number   of   syllables  per  line)  and  limit  the  possible  choices  among  the  words  that  can   be  set  to  the  melody"  (p.  521).  The  rhythm  of  a  piece  works  to  guide  the   lyrics,   potentially   working   as   a   subtle,   constant   reminder   of   structure,   helping  to  create  a  cohesive  musical  and  aesthetic  experience.

3.3. Music, Memory, and Information Retention
This   section   of   the   literature   review   explores   scholarly   works   that   consider   the   relationship   between   music,   memory,   and   information   retention.   Understanding   the   relationship   between   these   elements   is   crucial,  since  the  creation  of  the  three  musical  compositions  for  this  project   are   primarily   based   upon   this   area   of   research.   The   following   articles   discuss  music's  potential  to  be  a  rehabilitation  tool  that  assists  with  memory   and   information   retention,   primarily   using   studies   that   consider   the   relationship   between   music   and   patients   with   Alzheimer's   disease,   dementia,   or   other   variations   of   memory   loss.   Although   much   of   the   research  included  in  this  section  relates  to  Alzheimer's  patients,  awareness   of  the  influence  music  has  on  individuals  with  Alzheimer's  disease  assists   in   informing   the   creation   of   compositions   that   aim   to   aid   individuals   with   varied  forms  of  memory  loss  in  recalling  information. In   Young's   (2013)   article,   she   discusses   the   relationship   between   music   and   people   with   Alzheimer's   and   other   dementias   or   variations   of   memory  loss.  She  explores  the  idea  of  re-creative  music  therapy,  which  is   multifaceted.   One   aspect   of   re-creative   music   therapy   is   `music

22  

reminiscence   groups,'   in   which   "the   music   therapist   uses   live   and/or   recorded   precomposed   music   to   enhance   and/or   promote   participation   in   reminiscence  discussion  groups"  (Young,  2013,  p.  730).  Another  aspect  is   `lyric  analysis,'  in  which  "the  music  therapist  uses  lyrics  from  familiar  songs   (verbally   and   musically)   to   convey   a   positive   message   or   to   validate   a   client's  feelings"  (Young,  2013,  p.  730).  Although  there  is  currently  no  cure   for  most  dementias,  Young  (2013)  demonstrates  the  importance  of  music   as  a  potentially  communicative  and  rehabilitating  tool  that  could  be  used  to   assist  patients  with  varied  forms  of  memory  loss.   In   line   with   Young   (2013),   Moussard   et   al.   (2012)   show   interest   in   music's   influence   on   memory   and   information   retention.   Their   study   questions  whether  music  assists  in  the  learning  and  memorization  of  new   lyrics,  using  a  68-year-old  patient  with  mild  Alzheimer's  disease  as  a  basis   for  their  study  (Moussard  et  al.,  2012).  The  authors  test  the  memorization   ability  of  the  participant  in  the  following  conditions:  "(1)  spoken,  (2)  sung  on   a  non-familiar  (NF)  melody,  (3)  sung  on  a  recently  learned  (low  familiar,  LF)   melody,   and   (4)   sung   on   a   life-long   and   highly   familiar   (HF)   melody"   (Moussard  et  al.,  2012,  p.523).  The  results  of  the  study  indicate  that  in  the   early  stages  of  learning  lyrics,  singing  does  not  assist  with  memorization  of   the   lyrics   and   is   more   difficult   to   learn   when   the   melody   was   unfamiliar   (Moussard   et   al.,   2012).   But   after   several   learning   sessions,   the   results   demonstrate   an   increase   in   memorization   ability   (Moussard   et   al.,   2012).   Moussard  et  al.  (2012)  additionally  note  that  when  lyrical  recall  is  "delayed

23  

by  one  month  (week  9)  or  even  10  [minutes],  sung  words  are  better  recalled   than  spoken  words"  (p.  528),  supporting  the  power  of  music  as  a  factor  that   assists   in   verbal   retention   and   validating   the   use   of   music   as   a   communicative  tool. Other  research  in  this  field  offers  similar  results,  supporting  the  use   of  music  as  a  factor  that  assists  in  information  retention  and  memory  recall   (El  Haj,  Antoine,  Nandrino,  Gély-Nargeot,  and  Raffard,  2015;  Palisson  et   al.,   2015;   Simmons-Stern,   Budson,   and   Ally,   2010).   Simmons-Stern,   Budson,   and   Ally   (2010)   explain   that   "the   daughter   of   an   [Alzheimer's   disease]   patient   ...   described   successfully   teaching   her   father   current   events   by   singing   news   stories   to   the   tune   of   popular   songs"   (p.   3164).   Simmons-Stern,  Budson,  and  Ally  (2010)  examine  whether  music  has  an   influence   on   memory   in   patients   with   Alzheimer's   and   if   it   can   assist   the   learning   process.   Using   children's   songs   (unfamiliar   to   the   patients)   with   repetitive   melodies   as   a   basis   for   their   analysis,   the   authors   state   that   patients  with  Alzheimer's  could  recall  lyrics  of  songs  better  when  they  were   accompanied  by  a  sung  recording  rather  than  a  spoken  recording,  implying   that   music   can   be   an   effective   tool   to   teach   information   to   those   with   memory-loss   diseases   (Simmons-Stern,   Budson,   and   Ally,   2010).   Furthermore,  they  note  that  future  studies  in  this  area  can  investigate  "the   possibility   of   presenting   practical,   every-day   information   to   patients   with   [Alzheimer's   disease]   in   the   form   of   song"   (Simmons-Stern,   Budson,   and  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

24  

Ally,  2010,  p.  3166),  which  is  what  this  project's  creative  compositions  aim   to  do. According  to  Calvert  and  Tart  (1993),  the  nature  of  songs  and  the   repetition  present  within  them  causes  the  melody  of  a  song,  along  with  the   lyrical  content,  to  be  easily  rehearsed  and  remembered.  Calvert  and  Tart   (1993)  emphasize  the  communicative  power  of  music,  noting  that  elements   within  a  composition,  such  as  a  constant  rhythm  denoting  a  pattern,  assist   with   this   retention.   The   inclusion   of   a   steady   rhythmic   pattern   was   an   important  consideration  to  be  aware  of  during  the  creation  of  this  project's   musical  compositions.     Taking   a   slightly   different   approach,   Eschrich,   Münte,   and   Altenmüller  (2008)  analyze  the  relationship  between  emotional  music  and   memory.  Their  study  examines  the  influence  of  music  on  memory,  exploring   whether   emotional   music   is   better   remembered   than   music   that   is   less   emotional  (Eschrich,  Münte,  and  Altenmüller,  2008).  Eschrich,  Münte,  and   Altenmüller  (2008)  state  musical  pieces  that  are  heavily  emotional  (those   that  induced  high  levels  of  arousal)  are  better  remembered  by  listeners  than   those  that  are  less  emotional.  These  results  suggest  that  emotion  present   in   a   musical   piece   is   critical   to   the   retention   of   ideas   presented   in   that   musical  piece.   Samson,   Dellacherie,   and   Platel   (2009)   also   show   interest   in   the   influence  emotion  present  in  musical  compositions  has  on  memory.  More   specifically,   their   four   studies   determine   the   extent   that   emotion   in   music  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

25  

can   impact   memory.   The   first   is   concerned   with   a   comparison   between   emotion,  music,  and  memory  in  patients  with  temporal  lobe  epilepsy  (TLE)   and  those  without.  In  the  first  study  on  participants  without  TLE,  the  authors   conclude  that  emotion  present  in  a  song  ­  specifically  the  emotions  of  fear   and   happiness,   which   have   high   arousal   levels   ­   can   strengthen   the   recollection  of  the  song  presented  with  said  emotion  (Samson,  Dellacherie,   and  Platel,  2009).  These  results  differ  in  the  second  study  which  examine   eight   patients   with   temporal   lobe   epilepsy   who   were   non-musical,   in   this   case  noting  that  peaceful  music  was  better  remembered  over  "contexts  with   high   arousal,   such   as   happiness   and   to   some   extent   fear,   [which]   do   not   appear  to  enhance  memory  as  compared  to  excerpts  with  low  arousal  level"   (Samson,  Dellacherie,  and  Platel,  2009,  p.  249).  The  authors  hypothesize   that  this  reaction  to  peaceful,  low  arousal  level  music  could  be  a  result  of   lowering  the  listener's  level  of  anxiety,  assisting  in  enhancing  their  memory   (Samson,  Dellacherie,  and  Platel,  2009).  Following  the  first  two  studies  are   two   more   that   specifically   relate   to   musical   memory   in   patients   with   moderate   to   severe   Alzheimer's   disease.   The   first   of   the   two   studies   examine   familiarity   of   strictly   verbal   compositions,   strictly   musical   compositions,  and  compositions  that  paired  music  with  lyrics,  experienced   through   repeated   exposure   over   an   extended   period   of   time   (Samson,   Dellacherie,   and   Platel,   2009).   The   results   of   the   study   suggest   that   excerpts   that   include   "musical   stimuli   [produce]   a   stronger   feeling   of   familiarity  than  verbal  ones"  (Samson,  Dellacherie,  and  Platel,  2009,  p.251).

26  

The  second  of  the  two  studies  focuses  on  long-term  retention  of  poems  and   musical  compositions,  along  with  the  ideas  and  emotions  presented  in  those   compositions  (Samson,  Dellacherie,  and  Platel,  2009).  The  findings  indicate   that   musical   compositions   are   better   remembered   than   verbal   poems   (Samson,  Dellacherie,  and  Platel,  2009).  In  addition,  the  authors  note  that   participants  can  distinguish  between  the  happy  and  sad  emotions  present   in  the  compositions,  with  happy  compositions  moving  and  arousing  listeners   more  than  sad  compositions  (Samson,  Dellacherie,  and  Platel,  2009).  All  of   these   results   indicate   that   emotion   influences   memory   of   musical   compositions;   further   suggesting   that   emotion   present   in   a   musical   piece   could  assist  a  listener's  memory  of  not  only  the  musical  piece  itself,  but  also   the  information  presented  in  that  musical  piece.     

4. Methodology
The  primary  method  being  used  in  this  research-creation  project  is   the  research-creation  methodology.  A  research-creation  project  is  one  that   "typically   [integrates]   a   creative   process,   experimental   aesthetic   component,  or  an  artistic  work  as  an  integral  part  of  a  study"  (Chapman  and   Sawchuk,   2012,   pg.   6).   The   research-creation   methodology   has   been   recognized  relatively  recently,  becoming  more  widely  used  in  the  areas  of   digital  humanities  and  social  sciences  within  the  past  15  years  (Chapman   and  Sawchuk,  2012).  Chapman  and  Sawchuk  (2012)  describe  four  different  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

27  

types   of   research-creation,   including:   ""research-for-creation,"   "research- from-creation,"  "creative  presentations  of  research,"  and  finally,  "creation- as-research""  (pg.  7).  For  this  research-creation  project,  I  used  the  method   of  "creative  presentations  of  research,"  (Chapman  and  Sawchuk,  2012)  as   this   project's   compositions   are   a   result   of   scholarly   research   gathered   during  the  study.  A  large  amount  of  literature  has  informed  the  creation  of   the   three   compositions,   but   only   those   that   refer   to   specific   musical   elements   and   the   impact   they   have   on   communicating   emotion   in   a   composition,  and  whether  they  can  influence  retention  were  used  to  guide   the  creation  of  the  compositions. The   literature   gathered   for   this   project   was   primarily   found   online   using   ScienceDirect,   EBSCOhost,   and   Google   Scholar,   searching   key   terms   such   as   "Music   and   emotion,"   "Music   and   advertising,"   "Music   and   cognition,"   "Music   and   Alzheimer's   disease,"   "Music   and   (retention   of   information),"   and   "Information   retention   and   emotion".   Initial   searches   in   these  databases  yielded  a  wide  range  of  results.  As  a  result,  those  that  did   not   speak   specifically   to   the   communicative   influence   of   specific   musical   traits   were   excluded.   Informed   by   sampling   techniques   used   in   empirical   research   methods,   articles   were   sampled   on   a   non-probability   basis,   choosing  articles  based  on  the  factor  of  being  purposive  (those  that  were   relevant   to   the   research-creation)   ("How   To...   Conduct   Empirical   Research,"  n.d.).

In  order  to  inform  the  research-creation  methodology,  an  inductive   literature  analysis  was  performed,  examining  existing  text-based  research   in  the  field.  Determining  the  extent  to  which  research  has  developed  in  this   field   through   this   analysis   has   strengthened   my   research   and   offered   insights   that   contributed   to   this   study   and   the   creation   of   its   creative   components.   The   findings   associated   with   the   observations   have   contributed   to   an   understanding   of   this   area   of   research,   informing   my   viewpoint  related  to  the  appropriate  methods  and  musical  techniques  to  use   when  communicating  with  individuals  through  music.  It  has  also  contributed   to  an  understanding  of  research  areas  that  could  be  explored  in  the  future.

5. The Compositions: An Overview
This  research-creation  project  considers  the  ways  that  music  can  be   used  to  assist  in  aiding  verbal  memory  and  communicating  emotion,  and   includes   three   original   musical   compositions   that   were   developed   in   response   to   the   scholarly   literature   on   this   topic.   The   three   musical   compositions   that   have   been   produced   for   this   project,   each   between   50   and  100  seconds  in  length,  aim  to  communicate  emotion,  create  aesthetic   satisfaction,  and  aid  in  reinforcing  the  production  of  memories  based  on  the   information  presented  in  the  compositions.   There  are  five  elements  that  these  compositions  have  in  common:   (1)  they  are  all  composed  in  a  4/4  time  signature,  (2)  they  may  share  chords

29  

but   no   two   compositions   will   have   identical   chord   progressions,   (3)   they   each  use  a  different  primary  instrument,  (4)  they  each  aim  to  elicit  one  of   the   three   emotions   discussed   by   Fritz   et   al.   (2009);   happy,   sad,   or   scared/fearful,  and  (5)  they  are  all  between  50  and  100  seconds  long.  The   primary  instruments  used  in  the  compositions  are:  (1)  ukulele  (2)  guitar,  and   (3)  piano.  These  were  the  primary  instruments  chosen  for  the  compositions   as  they  each  have  a  different  timbre  (tone),  and  are  three  instruments  that   I   have   experience   playing   and   composing   with.   Although   each   musical   composition   uses   a   particular   primary   instrument,   additional   background   instruments  such  as  drums  and  violin  were  used  in  each  composition.  The   background   instruments   included   in   the   compositions   are   synthesized   sounds   made   to   sound   like   original   instruments,   and   were   found   in   the   Apple   GarageBand   library.   Although   these   background   instruments   are   synthesized  representations  of  instruments,  they  are  original  arrangements   that  were  composed  using  a  keyboard.

5.1. Composition Influences from Literature
This   project's   creative   compositions   were   informed   by   content   gathered   from   existing   literature   in   the   field   discussing   musical   elements   and   the   impact   they   have   on   the   way   a   musical   piece   is   heard   and   perceived.   The   following   section   is   a   discussion   of   scholarly   work   from   authors  that  speak  to  the  communicative  power  of  music,  and  the  influence   that  particular  musical  elements  can  have  on  aiding  memory  and  assisting   with  information  retention.  As  mentioned  above,  the  literature  gathered  for  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

30  

this   project   was   primarily   found   on   Google   Scholar,   ScienceDirect,   and   EBSCO,   using   a   variety   of   different   key   terms   related   to   this   area   of   research.   As   initial   searches   in   these   databases   yielded   a   wide   range   of   results,  those  that  did  not  specifically  speak  to  the  communicative  influence   of   specific   musical   elements   were   excluded.   Informed   by   sampling   techniques  used  in  empirical  research  methods,  articles  were  sampled  on   a   non-probability   basis,   choosing   articles   based   on   the   factor   of   being   purposive  (those  that  were  relevant  to  the  research-creation)  ("How  To...   Conduct  Empirical  Research,"  n.d.).

5.1.1. Emotion.
    Eschrich,  Münte,  and  Altenmüller  (2008)  found  musical  pieces  that   were  heavily  emotional  were  better  remembered  than  those  that  were  less   emotional.   The   stimulation   associated   with   heavily   emotional   musical   pieces  (Eschrich,  Münte,  and  Altenmüller,  2008;  Samson,  Dellacherie,  and   Platel,   2009)   indicates   the   importance   of   emotion   present   in   the   musical   compositions  created  for  this  study.   Furthermore,  Juslin  and  Laukka's  (2001)  study  on  the  impact  vocal   intonation  has  on  perceived  emotions  in  a  listener  was  important  to  consider   when   creating   these   compositions.   Their   study   suggested   that   vocal   expression  influences  the  perceived  emotion  of  what  is  being  stated  (Juslin   and   Laukka,   2001).   Specific   acoustic   cues   (i.e.   high-frequency   energy)   foreshadowed  the  emotion  intensity  rating  results  in  their  study  (Juslin  and   Laukka,   2001).   This   has   informed   the   compositions,   as   there   is   clear  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

31  

evidence  suggesting  the  importance  of  vocal  expression  when  attempting   to  communicate  a  specific  emotion.  

5.1.2. Chords used and tempo.
The   chosen   musical   mode   of   the   compositions   was   based   on   discussion   in   Vieillard   et   al.'s   (2008)   article,   which   addressed   the   pairing   between  musical  structure  in  a  composition  and  the  emotion  a  composition   aims  to  elicit.  For  the  sake  of  their  study,  they  classified  happy  compositions   as  having  a  fast  tempo  in  a  major  mode,  sad  compositions  as  having  a  slow   tempo   in   a   minor   mode,   and   threatening   compositions   as   having   an   intermediate  tempo  in  a  minor  mode  (Vieillard  et  al.,  2008).  For  the  sake  of   my   compositions,   scared/fearful   has   been   made   interchangeable   with   Vieillard   et   al.'s   (2008)   classification   of   threatening,   therefore   the   scared/fearful   composition   has   an   intermediate   tempo   in   a   minor   mode.   Simmons-Stern,   Budson,   and   Ally   (2010)   noted   that   future   studies   in   the   area   of   music   and   memory   loss   could   investigate   "the   possibility   of   presenting   practical,   every-day   information   to   patients   with   [Alzheimer's   disease]  in  the  form  of  song,"  (Simmons-Stern,  Budson,  and  Ally,  2010,  p.   3166)  which  is  what  these  compositions  aim  to  do.  

5.1.3. Primary instrument.
Poulin-Charronnat   (2004)   emphasized   the   impact   the  

instrumentation  in  a  musical  piece  could  have  on  the  way  it  is  perceived.   The   focus   of   Poulin-Charronnat's   (2004)   experiment   was   to   uncover  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

32  

whether  or  not  the  timbre  associated  with  a  musical  instrument  impacts  the   way  a  listener  recognizes  and  remembers  a  musical  piece.  The  results  of   the   study   suggested   that   a   change   in   the   timbre   (tone)   of   a   musical   instrument   in   a   piece   has   substantial   impact   on   the   way   the   excerpt   was   remembered   (Poulin-Charronnat,   2004).   Poulin-Charronnat   (2004)   explained   that   "the   detrimental   effect   of   timbre   change   on   recognition   for   musicians  demonstrates  that  timbre  qualities  are  indeed  integrated  into  this   trace,   because   performance   deteriorates   drastically   when   the   instrumentation   changes   between   the   memorized   excerpt   and   the   to-be- recognized  excerpt,  even  though  listeners  were  instructed  to  ignore  such   changes"   (p.   248).   By   this,   Poulin-Charronnat   (2004)   was   explaining   that   the   memory   of   a   musical   composition   was   closely   tied   to   the   timbre   and   tone  of  the  instruments  used  in  the  composition.  If  the  timbre  and  tone  of  a   composition   were   to   change   (i.e.   if   a   piano   was   used   to   play   a   piece   originally   played   on   a   guitar),   this   would   hinder   an   individual's   ability   to   adequately  remember  a  composition  and  the  ideas  present  within  it.     This  could  have  implications  for  future  research  in  this  area  beyond   the   scope   of   this   MRP.   When   testing   the   effectiveness   of   these   compositions,  it  will  be  important  to  use  the  same  instrument  continually  (or   play   an   exact   recording   of   the   composition)   when   examining   the   piece's   communicative  ability.  In  general,  this  could  be  a  useful  point  to  be  aware   of  for  those  playing  musical  compositions  to  those  who  have  experienced   varied  forms  of  memory  loss.  If  an  individual  were  to  play  and  sing  musical  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

33  

excerpts  on  a  guitar  in  an  attempt  to  evoke  memory  of  the  verbal  message   within  the  musical  piece  to  an  individual  who  suffers  from  a  type  of  memory   loss,   the   evidence   put   forth   by   Poulin-Charronnat   (2004)   suggests   that   it   would  be  important  to  use  the  same  instrument  each  time  the  composition   is  played.     For  the  sake  of  the  compositions  created  for  this  project,  the  primary   instruments   of   ukulele,   guitar,   and   piano   were   chosen   based   on   their   different  timbre  (tone),  and  the  fact  that  they  are  three  instruments  I  have   experience  playing  and  composing  with.    

5.1.4. Message.
The   message   of   these   compositions   was   not   informed   by   any   particular  scholarly  work,  but  was  informed  by  personal  knowledge  of  the   issues  faced  by  my  family  member  who  has  dementia.    

5.1.5. Lyrics.
The   lyrics   in   each   composition   were   created   with   repetition   (Hargreaves,  1984;  Ockelford  2006;  2009;  2013)  and  rhyming  in  mind,  as   these   traits   emphasize   music's   ability   to   communicate   and   become   ingrained  in  the  memory  of  the  listener.  A  rhyme,  specifically  an  end  rhyme,   in  a  technique  that  is  often  used  in  poetry  (Hyman  and  Rubin,  1990),  and   one  found  in  popular  music.  Repetition  of  exposure  to  repeated  melodies   has  been  demonstrated  to  assist  with  memory  in  patients  with  memory  loss

34  

(Moussard,   Bigand,   Belleville,   and   Peretz,   2012).   This   could   potentially   assist  in  retention  of  the  information  presented  in  the  compositions.     In   addition,   Moussard,   Bigand,   Belleville,   and   Peretz   (2012)   discussed  the  notion  of  rhythm  giving  cues  for  lyrical  structure,  directing  the   listener  to  be  able  to  logically  follow  along  with  the  musical  composition.  For   this  reason,  the  melody  of  the  lyrics  and  the  melody  of  the  lead  instrument   in  the  composition  share  a  similar  rhythmic  pattern.  This  could  additionally   relate   to   classical   conditioning   theory   (Bierley,   McSweeney,   and   Vannieuwkerk,   1985).   For   example,   if   a   listener   hears   the   melody   of   the   piano  in  Composition  C  without  the  lyrics  (after  repeated  exposure),  or  finds   themselves   humming   the   tune   of   the   composition,   they   may   still   be   impacted  by  the  message  on  a  subconscious  level. As  mentioned  in  my  introduction,  inspiration  for  the  lyrics  of  the  three   compositions   was   inspired   by   two   factors:   a   personal   family   member's   difficulty  with  everyday  tasks  (e.g.,  brushing  his  teeth,  shaving,  etc.)  and  a   detail   mentioned   in   Simmons-Stern,   Budson,   and   Ally's   (2010)   article   describing  the  daughter  of  an  Alzheimer's  patient  using  music  to  teach  her   father  about  current  news  stories.  

5.2 Composition Breakdown
   Below  is  a  specific  breakdown  of  each  composition,  consisting  of  the  

emotion  each  piece  aims  to  portray,  the  chords  used  in  the  composition,  the   tempo,  the  primary  instrument,  the  message  of  the  composition,  the  lyrics   in   the   composition,   and   discussion   of   the   chosen   lyrics.   Different   colours  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

35  

are  used  to  signify  where  rhyming  and  repetition  is  present  in  each  piece.   Each  composition  breakdown  has  a  section  titled  `Lyrics  in  the  composition,'   which  is  where  these  different  colours  will  be  visible.  Green  represents  an   end  rhyme;  for  a  rhyme  to  be  green,  it  must  rhyme  with  the  end  rhyme  in   the   line   above,   or   the   end   rhyme   in   the   line   below.   Orange   represents   a   prominent   word   used   as   an   adjective   that   is   repeated   throughout   the   composition;  for  a  word  to  be  orange,  it  must  be  mentioned  at  least  three   times.  Blue  represents  the  repetition  of  an  entire  line;  for  a  line  to  be  blue  it   must   be   an   exact   lyrical   replication   of   an   existing   line.   There   is   also   repetition  present  within  the  chords  used  in  each  composition.  At  the  end  of   each  lyrical  line,  there  will  be  a  list  of  the  musical  chords  used  in  that  line.   Red  represents  repetition  of  chords  used  from  line  to  line;  for  the  chords  to   be  red,  they  must  be  an  exact  replication  of  the  line  above  or  below  it.  The   chords  listed  are  the  base  chords  that  the  lead  melody  was  created  over.

The  lyrics  are  not  complex,  using  simple   words  and  an  easy-to-follow  melody.  Within  the  lyrics,  the  colour   of  the  toothbrush  or  toothpaste,  for  example,  could  be  changed  to   fit  an  individual's  preference  or  situation.  As  repetition  and   rhyming  were  evidenced  to  assist  with  memory  (Hargreaves,   1984;  Hyman  and  Rubin,  1990,  Calvert  and  Tart,  1993)  there  is  a   lot  of  repetition  and  rhyming  in  this  composition  in  the  lyrics,  the   melody,  and  the  chords  used  in  the  composition.

As  opposed  to  the  lyrics  in  Composition  A,  which   were  more  instructional,  the  lyrics  in  this  composition  are  using   the  emotion  of  sadness  to  set  the  tone  for  contemplation  of  life,   love,  and  loss.  Similar  to  Composition  A,  the  lyrics  in  this   composition  are  not  complex,  using  simple  words  and  an  easy- to-follow  melody.  Repetition  and  rhyming  were  also  heavily

   The  lyrics  in  this  composition  aim  to  communicate  the  risks   associated  with  contacting  hot  surfaces.  Similar  to  Composition   A,  the  lyrics  of  this  composition  were  purposefully  instructional,   with  the  goal  of  having  the  listener  be  aware  of  the  dangers   associated  with  touching  hot  surfaces.  The  word  "hot"  was  used   multiple  times  throughout  the  composition  to  emphasize  the   message  of  the  song,  with  repetition  of  the  phrase  "things  are   hot"  at  the  end  of  the  composition  to  further  accentuate  the   message.  

6. Discussion
The   following   section   includes   a   discussion   related   to   the   creative   process   that   occurred   when   producing   the   compositions,   along   with   an   individual  composition  summary.    

6.1. General Notes on Creating the Compositions
As   mentioned,   according   to   Calvert   and   Tart   (1993),   the   nature   of   songs  and  the  repetition  present  within  them  causes  the  melody  of  a  song,   along   with   the   lyrical   content,   to   be   easily   rehearsed   and   remembered.   Consequently,  repetition  was  an  important  factor  that  needed  to  be  included   to  not  only  support  memory  recall,  but  also  to  create  aesthetic  satisfaction.   When   there   is   repetition   present   in   a   musical   composition,   there   is   a  

COMMUNICATING THROUGH MUSIC

40  

constant  sense  of  expectation  being  met,  leading  to  a  feeling  of  aesthetic   satisfaction  and  resolution  (Ockelford  2006;  2009;  2013).    When  creating  the  compositions,  it  was  difficult  to  ensure  the  lyrics  

in  each  composition  effectively  communicated  the  desired  message  to  the   intended  adult  audience  in  a  way  that  did  not  come  across  as  puerile.  The   challenge   to   find   a   balance   between   creating   compositions   for   a   mature,   adult   audience,   while   also   recognizing   these   compositions   were   being   created  for  individuals  with  dementia  or  Alzheimer's  disease,  was  primarily   concerning   when   creating   Compositions   A   and   C,   as   they   were   very   instructional.  Though  the  goal  was  to  ensure  the  melody  and  lyrics  in  each   composition   were   uncomplicated   (to   assist   with   memory   recall),   future research should consider what level of lyrical complexity is appropriate for different spectrums of memory loss. This would ensure the message within the composition could be appropriately communicated to each group on the spectrum in the most effective way. Although  the  instructional  nature  of  Composition  A  and  Composition   C   resulted   in   the   aforementioned   communication   concern,   of   the   three   compositions,   Composition   A   and   C   were   the   easiest   to   compose.   They   both   came   together   very   quickly,   and   the   lyrics   effectively   depict   the   message  that  the  composition  aims  to  portray.  Composition  B  was  much   more  difficult  to  create,  as  the  message  of  the  song  was  less  specific  than   the  other  two  compositions,  and  as  a  result,  was  more  difficult  to  capture   through   the   lyrics.   There   was   no   specific   desired   action   associated   with

Composition  B,  whereas  Composition  A  and  C  were  asking  the  listener  to   remember  how  to  brush  their  teeth,  or  to  be  aware  of  the  risks  associated   with  touching  hot  surfaces.  The  lack  of  a  call  to  action  in  the  lyrics,  and  the   more  abstract  nature  of  the  message  that  Composition  B  was  attempting  to   portray  made  the  lyrics  more  difficult  to  write.     In  regards  to  the  emotion  each  composition  was  aiming  to  portray,   the  emotion  of  scared/fearful  was  the  most  difficult  to  depict.  The  musical   chords   used   for   the   emotion   of   happy   (primarily   major   chords   in   a   major   key)   and   the   emotion   of   sad   (primarily   minor   chords   in   a   minor   key)   lent   themselves   more   naturally   to   the   emotion   they   were   trying   to   portray.   However,   the   emotion   of   scared/fearful   (Composition   C)   relied   on   much   more  than  just  the  key  it  was  created  in  to  adequately  depict  the  emotion.   For  instance,  other  musical  factors,  like  the  dynamics  (how  quiet  or  loud  an   instrument   is   being   played)   in   the   piece   played   an   important   role   in   illustrating   the   emotion   of   Composition   C.   Although   factors   such   as   dynamics   played   an   important   role   in   the   portrayal   of   the   emotions   in   Compositions  A  and  B,  Composition  C  relied  more  on  a  change  in  dynamics   to  emphasize  the  chaos  associated  with  feeling  scared/fearful,  whereas  A   and  B  did  not.  For  example,  in  Composition  B  a  decision  was  made  to  play   the  guitar  using  a  softer,  plucking  pattern,  rather  than  a  heavy,  strumming   pattern.  The  chosen  dynamic  of  Composition  B  was  consistent  throughout   the  piece,  along  with  the  chosen  dynamic  of  Composition  A.  Contrary  to  A   and   B,   Composition   C   has   a   change   in   dynamics   throughout   the   piece,

resulting   in   a   more   chaotic   sound.   The   manipulation   of   the   dynamics   in   Composition  C  worked  to  create  a  sense  of  disorder,  further  emphasizing   the  feeling  of  being  scared/fearful.  

6.2. Individual Composition Summary
Composition   A.   Creating   this   composition   in   a   major   mode   with   primarily  major  chords,  as  informed  by  Vieillard  et  al.  (2008),  resulted  in  the   composition  sounding  happy,  which  is  the  emotion  this  composition  aimed   to  elicit.  The  timbre  of  the  ukulele  in  this  composition  is  very  bright,  as  it  is   a  higher-pitched  instrument,  again  reinforcing  the  notion  that  this  is  a  happy- sounding   composition.   In   addition,   a   faster   tempo   was   used,   taking   cues   from   Vieillard   et   al.'s   (2008)   study,   which   assisted   in   the   composition   conveying   the   desired   emotion.   As   mentioned   by   Eschrich,   Münte,   and   Altenmüller  (2008),  musical  pieces  that  were  heavily  emotional  (those  that   induced  high  levels  of  arousal)  were  better  remembered  by  listeners  than   those   that   were   less   emotional   (inducing   lower   levels   of   arousal).   This   composition  was  created  with  that  in  mind,  pairing  a  faster  tempo  with  an   upbeat  melody  in  hopes  that  this  resulted  in  a  production  of  high  levels  of   arousal  in  the  listener. The  background  instruments  supported  the  theme  and  emotion  this   composition   aimed   to   communicate.   The   bass   guitar   contributed   to   the   steady   rhythm   of   the   composition,   changing   notes   every   other   beat   in   a   continuous  pattern.  A  change  in  the  drum  beat  occurred  as  the  composition   entered   the   second   section   of   the   song   ("My   toothbrush   is   yellow,   my

43  

toothpaste  is  blue,")  which  will  be  referred  to  as  the  `chorus'.  In  the  chorus   of   this   composition,   the   lyrics   and   the   melody   of   the   vocals   are   the   most   repetitive,   which   is   why   the   most   important   aspect   of   the   message,   remembering  to  use  the  yellow  toothbrush  and  blue  toothpaste,  is  included   in  this  section.  In  addition,  the  vocal  melody  changes  in  the  chorus.  As  so,   I  chose  to  change  the  drum  beat  to  emphasize  the  differentiation  between   these  two  parts.   Composition   B.   Creating   this   composition   in   a   minor   mode,   with   primarily  minor  chords,  assisted  in  the  composition  sounding  sad.  The  warm   timbre  of  the  guitar  paired  with  the  softer  playing  of  the  instrument  (plucking   as   opposed   to   heavy   strumming)   emphasized   the   melancholic   features   typically  associated  with  sadness.  The  slow  tempo,  inspired  by  Vieillard  et   al.'s  (2008)  classification  of  sad  compositions  as  having  a  slow  tempo,  also   worked  to  portray  the  desired  emotion.  Taking  cue  from  Juslin  and  Laukka's   (2001)   study,   which   suggested   that   vocal   expression   influences   the   perceived  emotion  of  what  is  being  stated,  the  vocals  in  this  composition   were   purposefully   sung   very   calmly,   incorporating   raspy   vocal   qualities   throughout  the  piece  to  emphasize  the  emotion  this  composition  aimed  to   portray.   In   addition,   the   background   instruments   supported   the   theme   and   emotion  this  composition  aimed  to  communicate.  The  inclusion  of  synthetic   strings   (violin,   cello,   double   bass)   in   the   background   of   this   composition   worked  to  emphasize  the  melodic  and  melancholic  features  within  the  song,

further  emphasizing  the  emotion  of  sadness  that  this  composition  aimed  to   communicate.  The  rich  timbre  of  the  strings  paired  well  with  the  warm  lead   guitar  and  vocals.     Similar  to  Composition  A,  there  was  a  change  in  the  drum  beat  as   the   song   entered   the   chorus   ("Goodbye   baby,   goodbye   love").   The   differentiation  between  the  two  sections  of  this  song  was  also  marked  by  a   repetitive   guitar   note   that   elevated   the   entrance   into   the   chorus.   As   the   lyrical  message  in  the  chorus  of  the  composition  summarizes  the  message   the  entire  piece  aims  to  communicate,  it  was  important  to  emphasize  this   section.     Composition   C.   Pairing   this   composition   with   the   chosen   chord   progression  of  all  minor  chords  assisted  in  accentuating  the  scared/fearful   emotion  the  composition  aimed  to  portray.  In  addition,  the  more  aggressive   tone,  volume,  and  overall  vocal  expression  of  the  lead  vocal,  informed  by   Juslin   and   Laukka   (2001),   worked   to   create   a   feeling   of   tension   in   the   listener,  supporting  the  scared/fearful  emotion  this  piece  aimed  to  elicit  from   the   audience.   In   this   piece,   there   are   moments   where   the   vocals   are   purposefully  louder,  specifically  in  the  last  few  lyrical  phrases  when  the  word   "hot"   is   sung.   It   was   important   to   emphasize   "hot"   throughout   the   composition,  using  factors  such  as  repetition  and  increased  volume  to  do   so,  as  the  message  this  composition  aimed  to  communicate  was  about  the   risks  associated  with  touching  hot  surfaces.

The   background   instruments,   also   worked   to   accentuate   the   word   "hot."   A   cymbal   was   also   added   every   time   "hot"   was   sung,   which   emphasized  the  message  while  also  creating  a  change  in  dynamics  within   the  piece,  adding  to  the  chaotic  sound.  The  manipulation  of  the  dynamics   in  Composition  C  worked  to  create  a  sense  of  disorder,  further  emphasizing   the  feeling  of  being  scared/fearful. In this composition, the rhythm of the piano gave cues for the lyrical structure (Moussard, Bigand, Belleville, and Peretz, 2012), guiding the lyrics and working as a constant reminder of the vocal melody, helping to create a cohesive musical and aesthetic experience. As a result of the melody closely following the lead vocal the hope is that, after repeated exposure to the composition, an individual could listen to the lead piano without the lyrics and recall the entire message of the song. The  intermediate  tempo  of  the  composition,  inspired  by  Vieillard  et   al.'s   (2008)   classification,   was   an   aspect   that   was   challenging   to   incorporate.   When   creating   this   particular   composition,   I   experienced   a   desire   to   use   a   faster   tempo   in   an   attempt   to   add   to   the   chaotic   feeling   associated   with   being   scared/fearful.   This   leads   me   to   believe   that   an   intermediate   tempo   for   this   composition   may   not   have   been   the   most   effective.  This  lack  of  a  cohesive  pairing  between  the  tempo  and  chosen   emotion  could  be  a  result  of  Vieillard  et  al.'s  (2008)  classification  referencing   the  emotion  of  threatening,  rather  than  the  emotion  of  scared/fearful.  For   the  sake  of  this  MRP,  the  emotions  of  threatening  and  scared/fearful  were

interchangeable.  This  is  an  aspect  that  would  be  reconsidered  in  the  future   if  additional  compositions  were  to  be  created  with  the  same  objective.       

7. Future Implications and Research
Although  it  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  project,  these  compositions   were  created  with  the  intention  that  they  be  deployed  for  the  purposes  of   enhancing  the  memory  of  listeners  in  the  future.  As  a  result,  thought  was   given   to   the   ways   that   the   compositions   could   be   tested   and   used   as   a   method  to  understand  the  ways  that  music  can  communicate  to  individuals   with   varied   forms   of   memory   loss,   assisting   in   information   retention.   To   allow   for   more   complex   testing   and   analysis   of   the   compositions,   each   composition   was   created   with   the   inclusion   of   specific   traits   (emotion,   particular   instruments,   etc.)   to   serve   as   a   basis   for   evaluating   the   communicative  power  of  the  compositions.  Upon  hearing  the  compositions   repeatedly,  the  participants  of  the  study  would  be  asked  to  rate  the  various   aspects   of   the   compositions   based   on   their   ability   to:   (1)   effectively   communicate   emotion,   (2)   effectively   communicate   the   idea   presented   in   the   lyrics,   (3)   be   aesthetically   pleasing,   and   (4)   assist   with   cognitive   comprehension  and  information  retention.

8. Conclusion
   This   MRP/research-creation   project   explored   music   as   a   communicative   medium,   specifically   the   way   that   music   can   assist   in   cognitive   comprehension   and   information   retention   in   individuals   with   memory  loss.  Scholarly  literature  that  discusses  the  influence  of  music,  the   presence   of   emotion   in   music,   how   musical   elements   can   be   used   to   facilitate  communication,  and  the  relationship  between  music  and  memory   was  used  to  inform  the  creation  of  three  musical  compositions  designed  to   communicate  emotion,  create  aesthetic  satisfaction,  and  aid  in  recollection   and   memory   of   the   information   presented   in   the   compositions.   Using   a   research-creation  method  for  this  project  has  allowed  for  the  production  of   material   that   could   be   utilized   to   develop   further   studies   in   this   area   of   research  in  the  future.
