A Comparative Policy Analysis of Wind Farm Development Strategies in Ontario and Germany    Leo Lau, 2014  Master of Applied Science  Environmental Applied Science and Management  Ryerson University      ABSTRACT    Wind farm development strategies are compared with respect to gaining public acceptance between  Ontario and Germany. Public opposition to wind farm development is currently experienced in Ontario  and strategies employed by Germany to mitigate public opposition and gain public acceptance have  been proven to be effective. These two jurisdictions are comparable due to similar jurisdictional  responsibility for renewable energy development and implementation of climate change goals. Historical  factors have been shown to trigger wind farm development for Ontario and Germany but certain  historical events have played a larger impact to public acceptance in Germany. Germany has been able to  maintain and increase the level of public acceptance to wind farm development by utilizing inclusive  planning legislation and encouraging community based incentives. Ontario has developed legislation to  increase wind farm development but has increased wind farm opposition. Ontario could increase public  acceptance to wind farm development by learning from Germany's experiences.                      iii

Introduction
Fossil fuels have dominated the world for centuries as a primary source of energy due to their  abundance and fairly inexpensive cost. Although many factories, transportation modes, and other  industries enjoy the benefits of the energy created by fossil fuels, there are several drawbacks, such as  the generation of greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion byproducts of fossil fuels. The  common byproducts from these emissions such as CO2, NOx, SO2, and fine particulate matter  contribute to the detriment of the environment in the form of greenhouse gas, climate change, acid rain  and poor air quality. These environmental issues can cause further problems, including increasing sea  levels, frequent storms, human health problems such as respiratory ailments, and harm to wildlife and  their respective habitats. In addition to environmental impacts caused by fossil fuel use, the rise in the  cost of fossil fuels in recent decades has begun to cause decision makers to seek alternative forms of  energy.  One of the alternatives decision makers are seeking out is renewable energy. Renewable energy  is a form of energy which originates in the natural environment and includes wind, sun, geothermal  activities, and tides as sources.  The transition towards renewable energy was triggered by a greater  awareness of and concern about global warming, climate change, and the increase in fossil fuel costs.  The renewable energy movement has been gaining momentum in the last few decades with billions of  dollars in investments for research and development, manufacturing, jobs, and infrastructure.  The member states of the European Union are shifting towards a low carbon economy by  setting a national renewable energy target to have 20% renewable energy produced by 2020. To achieve  this goal, 60 to 70 billion Euros of investment is needed for research and development. This goal would  require strong political support (Kitzing et al., 2012).

Ontario has been recently increasing the use of renewable energy sources to satisfy the  province's electricity demands. This renewable energy initiative will enable the Liberal Government's  plan to phase out coal powered plants by 2014 (Ministry of Energy, 2012). As of January 2014, the  Thunder Bay Generating Station is currently the last remaining coal powered plant in operation and is  expected to be shutdown in mid2014 (Ontario Power Generation, 2014).   The Liberal Government is confident that renewable energy is a viable option to replace coal  power since it provides many environmental, health, and economic benefits over coal power. The direct  and indirect results of using renewable energy over coal energy are a decrease of pollutants that cause  smog and acid rain, a decrease in respiratory health problems, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and a  reduction in costs associated with mitigating air pollution (Ministry of Energy, 2012).  Wind energy will be the alternative energy source focused on in this study as the government of  Ontario is currently employing it and there have been controversies regarding it from wind energy  opposition groups. These opposition groups have voiced their concerns using various forms of media  and have also protested in public venues including Queens Park (Newswire, 2012). Wind turbine  development in Ontario is considered controversial in many communities. Public opposition to wind  turbine development is common when wind farm developments are proposed. Critics have argued that  wind turbines decrease property values, disrupt natural landscapes and wildlife, and cause health  problems to people situated near them. Wind turbine proponents have difficulty in managing wind  turbine conflicts and gaining community acceptance for siting wind turbines.   The main health effects claimed by wind farm opponents include headaches, insomnia, loss of  concentration, and anxiety. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health's position is that wind turbines do  not cause human health problems, a conclusion which is widely debated by wind farm opponents.  The  topic of human health and wind turbines has become a prominent issue since a health study was      2   

commissioned by Health Canada in 2012. This study's findings are expected to be published in 2014 and  will determine if wind farms cause human health impacts. Wind farm opponents are optimistic that the  results will conclude wind farms cause negative human health impacts, thereby reinforcing their views  that wind farms should not be developed (CBC, 2013). However, wind farm proponents believe this  study will demonstrate there are no health impacts associated with wind farms, resolving this issue. This  topic in itself is a study on its own and will not be discussed in detail. However, it is important to  remember human health is commonly used as a reason to oppose wind farm development even though  conclusive evidence is not yet available.   Large scale wind farm development requires large amounts of land and height to optimally  operate. Wind speeds are stronger at higher altitudes and are best suited to produce the most power.  The requirements for successful wind farm development have resulted in landscapes being populated by  large wind farms. These visual landscape changes are unsettling to affected community members and  are one of the reasons why wind farm development is not favoured in these communities. The  perception by wind farm opponents of this change in the landscape is that it will result in a devaluation  of property value.  The purpose of this study is to compare what strategies have been used in Germany and Ontario  for wind development and examine which of them are more effective in gaining public acceptance.  The  objectives of this study are to examine Ontario and Germany's wind energy policy history which will  provide context for each jurisdiction's goals, policies, strategies, successes, and failures. It is expected  that history will play a pivotal role in each jurisdiction's policymaking.  Another objective is to compare  incentives and determine their effectiveness of mitigating opposition and gaining public acceptance. The  distribution of benefits and compensation between wind farm development and the affected  communities are expected to play a key factor for comparing each jurisdiction. Wind farm infrastructure 

   

3 

 

and feed in tariffs ("FIT") will be examined since these elements play a role in who would finance wind  farms and how they impact public attitudes. Policy making, planning, incentives, and infrastructure are  the four (4) key factors that will be analyzed to provide an explanation of what effective strategies  should be used to improve public acceptance. In the last decade, Ontario began wind farm development  to shift to a low carbon economy, but this has led to wind farm opposition. The next section will provide  some examples of the lengths to which public opposition groups will go to stop wind farm development.  WindFarmDevelopmentOppositionCasesinOntario   There have been several cases in Ontario where wind farm opponents have taken their cases to 

court in the hopes of legally rejecting wind farm developments. This is their only option since  municipalities have lost control of their ability to disapprove of these projects. An explanation of the  municipality's ability to reject wind farm development will be discussed in further detail later in the  Ontario Green Energy Act (GEA) section. This section will discuss several court cases and decisions in  Ontario to demonstrate the commitment of opposition groups to prevent wind farm development in  their respective communities.  Opponents are quite persistent in using Ontario's legal system to halt wind farm development.  There has been limited success challenging projects or Renewable Energy Approvals (REA) since it has  been difficult to prove to the Environmental Review Tribunal (ERT) that wind farms are violating the  Environmental Protection Act (EPA).The ERT is an independent and impartial tribunal created by the  Province of Ontario. The main role of the ERT is to provide public hearings and decide on matters  regarding orders, approvals, licenses, and permits relating to specific legislation, including but not  limited to, the Environmental Protection Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and Pesticides  Act (Environmental Review Tribunal, 2013). A REA is an approval which must be obtained by wind farm 

   

4 

 

proponents for wind farm development. The REA is issued by the Ministry of Environment (MOE) as a  requirement in Ontario Regulation 359/09 created under the EPA (Walker, 2013). 
Wainfleet

 

The Township of Wainfleet created a municipal bylaw on April 10, 2012, to prevent wind farm 

development from occurring within its municipal boundaries. The bylaw did not explicitly mention  prohibiting wind farm development within Wainfleet but created requirements for wind farm  development that are very difficult to fulfill. There are three core provisions within this bylaw: 1) all  industrial wind turbines within the Township are subject to a minimum setback distance from any  property; 2) noise emitted from any industrial wind turbine within the Township may not exceed 32 dB  at the nearest property; and 3) the wind farm developer must provide a 100% indemnification for any  property value loss or any adverse health effect caused by an industrial wind turbine (Timmins &  Smeijers, 2013).    The Ontario Superior Court of Justice recently determined the antiwind bylaw was invalid due 

to its vagueness and uncertainty. The term "property" was not clear and did not define who was  considered an "inhabitant". Also, this bylaw would conflict with the GEA (Saxe, 2013a). 
PrinceEdwardRoad

The first rejection by the ERT under s.142.2 (1) of the EPA occurred in July 2013. The ERT can  reject a wind farm development if the project has potential to cause serious harm to human health or  serious irreversible harm to plant life, animal life and the natural environment.   In the case of Prince Edward County, the ERT rejected the REA on the basis that the road to the  wind farm would negatively affect an existing population of turtles in the area, and not the actual wind  farm development. The REA did not satisfy the ERT requirements by providing a mitigation plan to  prevent harm to the turtles (Sahni & McCutcheon, 2013).      5   

ViolationoftheCharterofRights

 

The Municipality of North Middlesex attempted to use the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to 

reject a wind turbine development. Their argument cited s.7 of the Charter which states "Everyone has  the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in  accordance with the principles of the fundamental justice." The municipality's reasoning was that  certain sections of the EPA were unconstitutional since it required the wind farm opponent to prove the  likelihood of harm to human health. The ERT dismissed the municipality's claim since the municipality is  considered a corporation and not an individual; meaning, the municipality cannot claim the same rights  as an individual can under the Charter of Rights (Saxe, 2013b). 
Bill39

 

Opposition to wind farm development has not been limited to communities.  There has been 

mixed opinion among political parties in Ontario about wind power and renewable energy.  The  Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario has been opposed to wind farm development in the province.  The party's main arguments include the cost of the FIT system, threats to wildlife, and the suspicion that  turbines are the cause of adverse health effects (Ontario PC, 2012). In March 2013, the Progressive  Conservative party introduced Bill 39 to revoke the GEA. The bill would only allow wind turbines to be  developed with authorization from the municipality. If the bill had been passed, it would have  terminated the feedin tariff program and prevented the Ontario Power Authority (OPA) from entering  nonprofitable renewable energy contracts. Lastly, the bill would have removed amendments to the  Planning Act, which exempted renewable energy projects from policy statements, provincial plans,  official plans and zoning bylaws (Saxe, 2013c).

Policy&ParticipationComparativeAnalysis
WhyGermany? In contrast to the issues faced in Ontario, Germany has had many successful wind turbine  developments and enjoyed high levels of local acceptance for wind turbine projects. Germany was  chosen to be compared to Ontario with respect to wind development strategies, because Germany is  regarded as a world leader in renewable energy, especially in wind farm development.  Germany ranks  third in the world for installed wind capacity with approximately 31,332 MW, behind China with 75,564  MW and the United States with 60,007 MW (Global Wind Energy Council, 2013). The share of renewable  energy which accounts for Germany's electricity production has doubled from 6.3% in 2000 to 11.6% in  2006 (Büsgen & Dürrschmidt, 2009). At the end of 2012, renewable energy production rose to 21.9% of  Germany's total energy production (BDEW, 2013). In the last few years, the media have highlighted  Germany's commitment in promising to decommission all nuclear power plants in the country and move  towards renewable energy.    Germany was selected rather than China since Ontario and Germany share similar policies and 

climate change goal initiatives and both are working to shift towards a low carbon economy. China does  not currently have any climate change goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Heneghan, 2014).  In  the United States, each state is responsible for their renewable energy policies with respect to financial  incentives, rules and regulations (Delmas, 2011). This jurisdictional responsibility of renewable energy  between the state and federal level is the reason why the United States was not used to compare to  Ontario.   Although Germany and Ontario have both defined climate change goals and policies, they do not  have the same targets. Germany was also one of the first jurisdictions to develop and successfully  implement the FeedIn Tariff (FIT) program to provide a means for the government to increase      7   

investment in wind power. The FIT compensates energy producers by offering a higher cost per kilowatt  hour generated to offset high initial capital costs. Similarly, Ontario is also using FIT as a mechanism to  encourage wind farm development.  Germany's public acceptance of wind power and renewable energy is well known, especially in  recent years as there have been strong popular movements to shift away from the use and operation of  nuclear power plants within Germany. Germany's communities are not only more accepting of wind  farm developments, but also in some instances request wind farms to be developed in their vicinities.  Ontario on the other hand has experienced a lot of resistance wind farm development in communities  where these developments have been proposed. The similarities and differences between these two  jurisdictions will be compared and contrasted to determine what policy differences have been effective  in gaining public acceptance and reducing opposition for Germany and what Ontario might have done to  improve public acceptance.  ComparingGermanytoOntario A comparison of national wind farm development strategies between Canada and Germany was  not conducted in this study due to each jurisdiction's responsibilities of renewable energy policy  development. In Germany, the German federal government is responsible for the entire country's  energy management and decision making (BMWI, 2012).In Canada, each province is responsible for its  own energy management according to Part 92A of Canada's Constitution (Canadian Legal Information  Institute, 2012).Therefore these two jurisdictions, Ontario and Germany, are both responsible for  managing transmission, distribution, FIT, ensuring reliable supply and encouraging renewable energy  development (Practical Law, 2013). Ontario and Germany's jurisdictional responsibilities for energy  policy development and implementation are the same and this allows a proper comparison between  them.

Background In terms of land mass, Germany is almost three times smaller than the province of Ontario with  six times the population. Although Germany has less space and more population than Ontario, Germany  has fifteen times the number of wind turbines (approximately 31,000 MW) and Ontario uses 1.6 times  more energy than Germany on a per capita basis. Table 1 shows Ontario and Germany's population,  land mass, electricity consumption per capita, and installed wind capacity.

Table 1 suggests that Germany is successful in the installation of a greater number of wind  energy developments while having less land mass and more population than Ontario.  In terms of energy sources, the ones utilized in Ontario and Germany are quite different from  one another with the exception of natural gas. Table 2 illustrates the distribution of energy sources for  each jurisdiction as of 2012. It is interesting to see that Ontario's use of coal is much lower than  Germany's but the opposite is true for nuclear power.  The reason for the reduction of coal power is  discussed later in this study. The Ontario government has recently announced it will not make any new  investments in new nuclear reactors and plans to only refurbish existing ones (Radwanski, 2013).

More recently, Germany has elected to shutdown nuclear power plants and will continue to rely  on coal power as a temporary source of energy until renewable sources are able to meet the country's  full energy demands. According to the International Energy Agency, as of 2013, there are currently  several large coal generation plants under construction across Germany (IEA, 2013). Further  examination of Germany's plans to remove nuclear power as a source of energy will be explained later  in the German section of the Policy and Planning section. 

Methodology
This study is a policy comparison between Ontario and Germany's wind farm development  strategies and involves four key factors: policy, planning, incentives, as well as infrastructure and Feed InTariffs. This comparison will provide an explanation of the differences in the public's acceptance of  wind farm development in Ontario and Germany.  The policy and planning factors will be combined in one section and each jurisdiction will be  examined separately. Although policy and planning factors are different, the two factors are historically  tied to one another.  A historical overview will be given to provide context of events and circumstances  that triggered the formation of renewable energy policy and legislation.

A variety of Incentives for wind farm development from each jurisdiction will be presented and  compared. Comparing each jurisdiction's incentives will provide an understanding of which incentives  have been employed successfully to gain public acceptance.   The Infrastructure and FeedInTariff section will follow the same format as the Incentive  section. Wind farms would be useless without transmission infrastructure and effective distribution  networks to transport the energy generated from the source to the grid. Currently, the older  infrastructure that is in place would not have the capacity to handle the new energy sources in both  jurisdictions. This section investigates what is currently being done, what is planned for the future, and  the amount of investment that is allocated to infrastructure. In addition to the Infrastructure, Ontario  and Germany's FIT programs will be examined to determine their effectiveness and the level and extent  of influence on public acceptance or opposition.  However, the study will not include FIT pricing analysis  or economic modelling to determine which jurisdiction possesses the better FIT program as this topic is  quite extensive since it encompasses all types of renewable energy (including biomass, solar, and hydro)  and is outside the scope of this study.  This study includes a case study from Ontario and Germany which will demonstrate the causes  of public opposition, issues, and public acceptance. The case study in Germany will examine two towns;  one town's strategy is similar to Ontario's wind farm development and while the other town employed  the traditional German strategy. The case study in Ontario will examine the causes, failures, and  outcomes of offshore wind farm development at the Scarborough Bluffs. An offshore wind farm case  study was compared to an onshore wind farm case study to demonstrate that the offshore wind farm  should have had less opposition due to the large setback requirements which would have made noise  and health impacts an innocuous issue.

The discussion section will compare all these factors to determine similarities and differences  between the two jurisdictions and examines which factors have been successful for Germany.  Understanding each of the factors, could assist government and developers in changing public  attitudes related to wind turbine development in Ontario and improve the wind farm development  process. The result could potentially cause Ontario communities to eventually start taking the initiative,  like their German counterparts, and reach out to developers for wind power instead of developers  subjecting residents to them. Therefore it is important to investigate the factors which made Germany  so successful in wind farm development and what strategies are used for successful implementation.  This will also involve researching problems that have arisen and how these issues were resolved. It will  also determine whether Ontario will be able to implement Germany's strategies. Successful low carbon  transition and wind farm implementation strategies used in Germany could be recommended.  The main sources of information have been derived from academic journals, government  publications, law newsletters, industry publications, and newspapers. German information has been  generally accessible as it has been translated to English.    As mentioned earlier, this study will not investigate whether wind turbines cause human health  effects. Also, this study will not examine the effectiveness of wind turbines as an energy source. Many  studies have investigated wind turbines as viable sources of energy because they are known to have  intermittent production abilities.  

PolicyandPlanning
Public policy is defined as a system of laws, regulatory measures, and funding priorities that  address specific public issues. Municipal, state/provincial, and federal government bodies all develop  and implement policies to benefit their society (Kilpatrick, 2000). Government policies determine the 

   

12 

 

decision making direction for political entities. Germany and Ontario's leaders at all levels of  government are democratically elected by residents in their respective constituencies. The government  in office typically represents the majority voters. Generally, the policies created by politicians should  reflect the consensus at that level of government. In Ontario and Germany's cases, each respective  government had a variety of reasons to promote renewable energy sources. Renewable energy policies  were created to move the province/country towards a low carbon economy. Some reasons include  reducing C02 emissions, economic reasons, or reducing the use of nuclear power.  GermanyHistory,PolicyandPlanning
PowerGenerationPastandRenewableEnergyHistory

 

From the end of World War II until the 1970s Germany relied on fossil fuels and nuclear power 

as their energy sources. The oil crisis in 1974 was a trigger for Germany to develop a renewable energy  policy. For approximately fifteen years, this renewable energy policy focused on research and  development of renewable energy such as training personnel, development of prototypes, and  laboratory production (Lauber & Mez, 2006).    In 1982, the German government spent approximately 150 million a year at the peak of this  research and development stage. This amount was scheduled to drop to 86 million in 1986 since the  government began to shift away from renewable energy. The German government was transitioning to  mainly nuclear power. Although the renewable energy budget was scheduled to drop in 1986, this never  happened due to the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown incident (Lauber & Mez, 2006).    The Chernobyl nuclear incident  had a profound and lasting effect on the German population's 

opinion of nuclear power. The public opinion towards nuclear power became negative and two years  after the accident, nuclear energy opposition increased to more than 70% of the population and support 

   

13 

 

dropped to approximately 10%. Before the Chernobyl accident, support and opposition for nuclear  power was evenly divided in public opinion (Lauber & Mez, 2006).    After the Chernobyl incident, the German government reevaluated its renewable energy policy 

and moved to wind energy. Denmark served as a role model on how to effectively implement reliable  small scale wind power plants. An added benefit was that wind turbines were manufactured and  operated by Germans so it was economically favourable to make the transition. Wind turbine groups  and collectives which consisted of farmers, coops, and towns, were established to raise investment  capital for wind turbines and development. The German people became motivated to produce their own  energy and become less dependent on importing from other producers (Bruns & Ohlhorst, 2011). The  initial wind farms did not have a clear regulatory approval process. Wind energy was still considered to  be a newer and less familiar energy source rather than an independent energy sector. The Germans  knew that further refinement of wind turbine technology would be required for widespread use.    In the early 1990s, Germany set climate change initiatives to reduce its national greenhouse gas 

emissions. The German government began setting climate change goals in order to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions, a 30% reduction of 1987 levels of CO2 and methane emissions by 2005, reaching 80% by  2050. In 2007, renewable energies were able to reduce CO2 emissions by 115 million metric tons (Ohl &  Eichhorn, 2010).  Major reforms to energy policy were created to help achieve the goals that the  government set. The German government spent more than 1 billion on renewable energy research  between 1990 and 1998 (Lauber & Mez, 2006). The German wind energy industry increased more than  ten times from 1991 to 1995, and installed capacity grew from 106 MW to 1,120 MW (Bruns & Ohlhorst,  2011).    There was a two year slump in the wind industry due to market instability and uncertainty for  investors due to the power companies appealing the "Electricity FeedIn Act". Power companies did not      14   

want to be legally required to compensate wind producers feeding energy into the grid. The Electricity  FeedIn Act was replaced by the German Renewable Energy Act (ErneuerbareEnergienGesetz [EEG]) in  April, 2000.  The EEG was subsequently amended in 2004, 2009 and 2012 (Büsgen & Dürrschmidt, 2009).  The purpose of the EEG was to promote the development of renewable energy supply and increase  renewable energy consumption by at least 35% by 2020 and to 80% by 2050 (Federal Ministry for the  Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, 2013).   There are three main principles in the EEG that enable the promotion and encouragement of  renewable energy development projects. The purpose of the first principle was to ensure secured  renewable energy investments by guaranteeing FIT and priority grid connections. This would provide  renewable energy producers set prices and every kilowatt generated would be compensated for the  next twenty years. The second principle's purpose was to encourage innovation by gradually reducing  the FIT program benefits. As tariffs are reduced for renewable energy facilities, this would cause  renewable energy manufacturers to become more cost competitive through technological innovation.  The third principle ensured the cost of renewable energy would not be a burden on the public's "purse".  The intention of this principle was to prevent renewable energy from becoming subsidized through  taxes, as the costs would be passed onto consumers. The thought process behind this was fairness, as  those who use the most electricity should pay the most for its usage (German Renewable Energies  Agency Information Platform, 2013).  The German EEG has become a model for other states in the European Union (EU) as it is used a  framework for renewable energy development and financing. For example, nineteen of the twenty  seven member states of the EU have adopted the EEG model into their respective national acts and  legislation to help encourage renewable energy development (German Renewable Energies Agency  Information Platform, 2013).

During the market slump in the mid1990s, Germany began experiencing some opposition to 

wind turbine projects due to noise emissions, impacts to wildlife, and visual impacts to the local  landscape from communities. In addition to these concerns, the growth of wind turbine developments  exceeded the communities' comfort levels (Bruns & Ohlhorst, 2011). Wind turbine development  projects started to become hampered by environmental restrictions and community opposition.    In 1998, the German government amended planning laws to accommodate wind turbine 

developments in communities in order to reach Germany's climate change goals. This was done to both  achieve increased wind farm development while being transparent and mitigating conflicts (Geiler et  al., 2013). The German government recognized that regional planning was essential in combining their  federal goals with those at the local municipal level (Ohl & Eichhorn, 2010). The regional planning level  dealt with the placement of land use activities, infrastructure, and development of commercial,  industrial and residential areas (Ohl & Eichhorn, 2010).  These new amendments created to increase acceptance for wind farm development led to pre emptive siting policies and they relieved regional planners of the increasing pressure from developers  and communities. Initially, in the 1990s, the German wind farm development process was a bilateral  process between the wind power developers and local municipalities and was similar to the process  currently used in Ontario. This preemptive siting policy created a different planning scheme and gave  wind turbines precedence over other types of land uses.  These specify wind turbines are not allowed to  be built outside of these designated areas (Ohl & Eichhorn, 2010). Ontario currently does not have a  preemptive siting policy for wind farm developments. Using the preemptive siting policy, German  municipalities were able to define appropriate areas for suitable wind turbine development that would  have negligible impacts on the landscape, environment and community areas (Geiler et al., 2013).

Priority and suitability areas were created to designate land appropriate for proper wind farm  development. Priority areas were sites where wind turbines took priority over other types of land uses.  Suitability areas were areas where wind turbine development was feasible but prohibited in other areas  in a region (Ohl & Eichhorn, 2010). Suitable areas under the preemptive siting policy were chosen by  first mapping out all prohibitive criteria such as conservation areas, areas with high sensitivity of  landscape scenery, forests and residential areas (Geiler et al., 2013). The second step would be to  analyze and designate the wind energy potential of remaining available sites (Geiler et al., 2013). The  exclusion criteria may be different from state to state but their principles are generally similar (Geiler  et al., 2013). Under these new planning laws, wind farm projects and plans do not include public  involvement until the advanced stages since the suitability areas have been already been chosen  (Geiler et al., 2013).  Although suitability areas are predetermined by the regional planners, the EIA is  still required to ensure all impacts have been identified, evaluated, and considered in the decision making process (Geiler et al., 2013).  From a developer's perspective, knowing which areas are suitable for wind farm development is  beneficial as this saves time and money during the site selection and permitting process (Geiler et al.,  2013). Therefore, proper wind farm placement is essential to receive compensation since a higher rate  would be paid for efficient and productive wind farms.  A chosen wind turbine type must produce a  certain amount of power and the EEG would not pay for wind in poorly planned locations (Ohl &  Eichhorn, 2010).  These new planning amendments created by the German government greatly improved  approvals and social acceptance. It is important to note, however, that while this made the approvals  process easier, it also reduced the areas suitable for wind turbine developments and caused installation  rates to drop (Bruns & Ohlhorst, 2011).

After the planning laws were implemented, the rate of installed wind capacity drastically  increased and began to decrease and stabilize in the last six years. This could be attributed to the  reduction of suitable wind turbine areas onshore. Offshore and some onshore wind farm installations  may contribute to the steady installation rate anticipated for the next several years.  For comparative reasons, Table 4 illustrates the substantial increase in Ontario's installed wind  turbine capacity since 2006, with the exception of 2010. The lack of data is due to the recent transition  to renewable energy in Ontario compared to Germany.

It is uncertain and difficult to determine with the limited information available, if the GEA played  a part in increasing wind farm developments since the rate of change for wind farm development was  high before the GEA was introduced. It is expected that Ontario numbers will drop after new GEA  amendments are implemented since they are moving towards the same planning strategy as Germany  and offering more rewards for smaller wind farm projects. This should be reexamined over time to      18   

determine if the GEA has played a large part in wind turbine development. These figures do not include  offshore wind development because it is currently not permitted in Ontario. The installed wind turbine  capacity may increase if Ontario's imposed offshore wind farm moratorium was lifted.  Offshore wind  development in Ontario will be further discussed in the Case Study section.  In terms of public acceptance, Germany's renewable energy initiatives have been successfully  implemented. In 2009, over 100 German municipalities grouped together to set a community goal of  using locally produced renewable energy. The main sources of renewable energy consist of wind, solar,  water, and biomass gas. The renewable energy sector has contributed to the local community by  creating jobs, creating local income from soldoff energy, and lowering energy costs. With this new  energy source, the municipality could eventually become an energy exporter with the goal of creating  revenue (Kunze & Busch, 2011).    Based on Germany's past nuclear history, Germany continues to shift away from nuclear power 

by phasing out nuclear power plants across the country. The original nuclear phaseout deadline was set  at 2036 as proposed by Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2010 (Dempsey & Ewing, 2011). The German  people have been quite passionate in protesting against nuclear power and have urged German  politicians to shift away from nuclear power. For example, within weeks after the Fukushima nuclear  incident in 2011, approximately 250,000 people across Germany protested against nuclear power  (Baetz, 2011). Later in 2011, thousands of German antinuclear protestors chained themselves to a  railroad to disrupt the transport of nuclear waste from entering the country (Taylor, 2011).  Another  large antinuclear protest, where approximately 120,000 protestors formed a 120 km long human chain  in Hamburg, occurred in the previous year (The Local, 2010). Chancellor Merkel decided to expedite the  closure of nuclear power plants to 2022 due to greater pressure from the public (Hall, 2011). 

   

19 

 

 

With the phase out deadline quickly approaching and with 23% of Germany's current power 

supply coming from nuclear power plants there is a greater priority for renewable energy development  (Hall, 2011).  Community support for wind turbine development is an essential factor for success in  Germany's thriving wind industry.   In August 2011, the German federal government released the Energy Research Programme  designed to promote research and development activities utilized to achieve their policy targets. This  program has also resulted in the federal government increasing contributions to research and  development budgets from 1.9 billion between 20062009 to 3.5 billion for the period between 2011 2014 (IEA, 2013). The next section will discuss Ontario's policy making and planning strategies which  created public opposition towards wind farm development.  OntarioHistory,PolicyandPlanning OntarioPowerGenerationPast  In 1906, Adam Beck led Ontario's publiclyowned power project and created a power  generation facility in Niagara Falls, Ontario (Ministry of Energy, 2012). Hydroelectric power allowed the  citizens of Ontario to have access to electricity. However, after World War II, there was a need for other  sources of power to meet the province's electricity demand. Ontario added six coal powered generation  facilities in the 1950's to supply areas where demand was highest. Between the 1970s and 1990s,  nuclear power was added to supply Ontario's increasing electrical demands (Ministry of Energy, 2012).  In the 1990s, it was recognized that Ontario's power infrastructure was aging and required  upgrading and refurbishment. The power system became unreliable and there were concerns of poor  planning and mismanagement. By 1999, Ontario Hydro had accumulated a provincial debt of $38.1  billion dollars, which accounted for a third of the Province's debt (Trebilcock & Hrab, 2005). The cause of  this debt was primarily the capital costs of construction and expansion of nuclear power plants.      20   

Mismanagement and inefficiencies during these activities contributed to the cost of power generation  expansion. For example, the last of Darlington's units came online in 1993 but was originally scheduled  to be fully operational by 1983. The final cost of the Darlington nuclear power plant was $14.3 billion  dollars, approximately 3.7 times more than originally budgeted. This resulted in the price of electricity  rising 30% in the early 1990s (Trebilcock & Hrab, 2005).     In 1998, Ontario shifted towards an energy market which led to the privatization of generation, 

planning, and transmission in the energy sector.  The intent of privatization was to create more efficient  power production but this initiative was short lived. When the market opened in May 2002, the average  price of electricity rose approximately 30% due to increased consumption in the exceptionally warm  summer months (Ministry of Energy, 2012). Ontario electricity demands exceeded electricity capacity. In  November 2002, the Government of Ontario had to step in and freeze prices.  The Government realized  there were many issues that needed to be addressed with respect to the increase in demand and lack of  supply capacity (Trebilcock & Hrab, 2005). The blackout in 2003, which occurred in Ontario, reinforced  the need to fix the province's electricity policy. As a result, the Ontario government began shifting to  energy conservation and utilizing cleaner energy forms (Ministry of Energy, 2012).  In the last ten years, coal power has been gradually phased out of Ontario's power grid. It once  provided 27% of energy to Ontario's power grid, but now only supplies 0.9% (Ministry of Energy, 2012;  IESO, 2014).  The Ontario Liberal government decided to replace coal power with renewable energy.  Ontario has recently closed eighteen of nineteen coal units and the last unit is planned to be shutdown  in mid2014 (IESO, 2014). The closure of these coal plants has significantly reduced fossil fuel emissions.  Coal is a large contributor of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2)  emissions. In 2013, SO2, NOx, and CO2 emissions were observed to have dropped 93%, 90%, and 90%  from 2003 levels, respectively (Ministry of Energy, 2013). 

   

21 

 

RenewableEnergyPolicy In 2008, the Liberal government announced a plan to promote renewable energy development  in the Province. The Climate Change Action Plan outlined several steps that would be taken to achieve  the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a shift from coal power generation to renewable  energy technology. The Government pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 6% below the 1990  emitted levels recorded. They planned to reach targets of 6% below the 1990 levels by 2014, 15% below  by 2020, and 80% below by 2050 (Ministry of the Environment, 2010). To achieve the 6% goal by 2014,  the Government planned to shut down all coal power facilities (Ministry of Energy, 2012). The removal  of coal power energy is expected to reduce Ontario's carbon footprint by 75% (Ministry of Environment,  2010).    In the mid2000s, wind turbine developments were proposed in various communities in Ontario.  Wind turbine developers would typically find a suitable site and go through the Environmental  Assessment (EA) process for their project to be approved. Typically, the majority of developers would  compensate landowners for placing their wind turbine on the landowner's property but no form of  compensation would be given to their neighbours (Ontario Sustainable Energy Association, 2005). This  type of compensation led to an inequitable benefit distribution since the neighbouring properties  received no benefits while being in close proximity to the turbine. This uneven distribution also created  a division between neighbours who received no compensation, and landowners who did receive  compensation. This led to opposition to the developments in general (Breukers & Wolsink, 2007).   Community groups were very opposed to wind developments in their community based on the  potential negative economic impacts to the community, health impacts, and unwanted visual impacts in  their landscapes. Community groups in some areas were able to delay the EA process which forced  developers to stop wind turbine projects as they became financially unfeasible projects (Manning &  Vince, 2010).      22   

FormerEnvironmentalAssessmentProcessforRenewableEnergyProjects   The Environmental Assessment (EA) process was previously used to ensure that all 

environmental concerns from a proposed development were taken under consideration. Renewable  energy developers were also subject to this process. EAs involved many stages of consultation with the  public and government agencies.     The initial step in the process requires the developer to create a Terms of Reference ("ToR") 

document, which is the framework for carrying out the environmental assessment. This document  informed the Minister of Environment on how the developer would conduct the environmental  assessment with input from environmental studies, construction details, and consultation with the  public, aboriginal groups, and government agencies (Ministry of Environment, 2010). After the ToR  document is submitted to the MOE, the public, and affected government agencies are given the  opportunities to voice concerns and ask questions that the developer must address. The Minister  approves the ToR if it is found to be acceptable and the EA can proceed.  After the EA is completed and  submitted, a second review and comment period is in place for the public and government agencies. The  developer is able to make any changes to the EA during this period to address any concerns. The  Minister makes the final approval decision after the EA has been submitted.   The EA involves many stages in the approval process since it ensures transparency of the  communications between the proponent and the public. This approval process has been an issue for  wind developers since there was a lot of time and resources spent in the EA process and there was a  high possibility of rejection by government agencies.  GreenEnergyAct In order to improve Ontario's energy situation, the Liberal government introduced a focused  energy plan and policy in the early 2000s. One of the goals of this policy was to decommission all coal      23   

plants within the Province by 2014. Even with the new policy, during the renewable energy transition,  wind farm developers found difficulty in the EA process as they still faced heavy public opposition that  obstructed their wind farm approvals. The Liberal government responded by creating the GEA to reduce  the effects of opposition and expedite wind farm development.   The GEA was passed to improve the EA process since the approval process was too time  consuming and costly for the developer. The Ontario Liberal government passed the GEA in May of 2009  and it was enacted in September 2009 (Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, 2010). The GEA was  created to encourage renewable energy development for wind, solar, bioenergy and hydropower  (Stokes, 2013). The creation of the GEA has resulted in a strong response for renewable energy  applications totalling to over 15,000 MW, which is equivalent to approximately 43% of Ontario's current  electricity generating capacity.  Of the 15,000 MW, 69% was comprised of wind power (Yatchew &  Baziliauskas, 2011).    By creating a streamlined approval process for renewable energy developers, a developer could  build renewable energy facilities sooner to provide power to Ontario's power grid. The GEA assists in the  government's goal of replacing the energy lost from coal plants being shutdown in 2014 to meet its self imposed deadline. When the GEA was introduced, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty stated that the GEA  would prevent the "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) mentality that residents and antiwind groups have  often used to impede these projects (Ferguson & Ferenc, 2009). The GEA was instrumental in subsidizing  the capital investment for renewable energy by paying increased rates for renewable power through  FIT.  The introduction of the GEA also increased existing tensions between antiwind groups and  government and developers. Wind turbine opposition groups and communities throughout Ontario have 

   

24 

 

voiced their frustration with the GEA. These groups stated that the GEA removed their rights and  reduced their power to oppose developments in their own communities.      The GEA amended certain sections of the Planning Act (s.62) where it exempted renewable 

energy projects from Official Plans, zoning bylaws, and development permits. While these exemptions  were very effective in encouraging wind farm development, these exemptions also lead to less  municipal and local acceptance. Before the GEA, renewable energy projects were subject to the  municipality's approval to amend the Official Plan or change the local zoning bylaws. The enactment of  the GEA resulted in limited local autonomy by restricting of the municipality's power to approve or  reject renewable energy projects within their jurisdiction (Manning and Vince, 2010). This lack of local  autonomy reduced municipal involvement and resulted in less municipal commitment and support  (Breukers & Wolsink, 2007).  The original EA process gave antiwind development groups more power to  persuade their respective municipalities to reject proposed developments. Municipalities would use the  Planning Act as a means to reject wind farm development by stating the project did not conform to their  respective current zoning bylaws and/or the municipality's Official Plan. The majority of the community  groups' concerns (i.e. detriment to landscape, human health issues, and community economic impacts,  etc.) were no longer considered valid under the GEA and it became difficult to reject wind development  projects.  Although the GEA was effective in increasing approvals of wind farm developments, there was a  loss in local autonomy. This resulted in a further divide between wind farm opponents and proponents.  In addition, the GEA made winning the appeals process very challenging for opponents as it required a  hearing by the ERT. Any resident in Ontario may appeal a wind farm development but the resident must  demonstrate to the ERT that the EPA has been violated for the ERT to consider a hearing. The resident  must demonstrate the wind farm project will either cause serious harm to human health or cause 

   

25 

 

serious or irreversible harm to plant life, animal life or the natural environment (Walker, 2013). There  have been no cases yet in Ontario where the ERT has rejected a wind farm development on grounds of  harm to human health. As stated earlier, the ERT has recently rejected a wind farm project in Prince  Edward County on the basis that the proposed road leading to the potential wind farm would be  detrimental to a population of turtles. Therefore, the developer did not satisfy the ERT by providing a  mitigation plan to prevent harm to the turtles (Sahni & McCutcheon, 2013).  Germany was also faced with problems similar to Ontario with respect to opposition to wind  farm developments, but the strategies utilized by Germany lead to a different outcome. Germany's  policy making history and planning strategy will be examined in the section below. 
FuturePolicyandPlanningDirection

 

In late 2012, Dalton McGuinty, the Premier of Ontario, considered to be the figurehead of the 

GEA, announced his resignation. In early 2013, Kathleen Wynne was selected as the new Premier of  Ontario and it was uncertain whether she would revise the GEA developed under the McGuinty  government.    In mid2013, the Wynne government announced several initiatives to revise the renewable 

energy development process. The FIT program was to be redeveloped and cater to projects less than  500 kW. Renewable energy projects greater than 500 kW were to undergo another procurement  process but the details of this new process have not been released as of writing (Lord, 2013).   Another change to the renewable energy approval process is that the province will work with  municipalities to provide them with the power needed to approve renewable energy projects within  their jurisdictions. The provincial government anticipated the new process would require developers  and renewable energy planners to work with the municipality to select appropriate locations and site  requirements for any future renewable energy projects (Government of Ontario, 2013a). These new      26   

initiatives appear to have been created to promote local acceptance and positive attitudes in current  and potential communities involved with renewable energy development.    Both Germany and Ontario experienced energy issues that led to the development of wind 

farms. These two jurisdictions also encountered the same problems with public opposition. However,  this is where the similarities between Germany and Ontario on wind farm development end. A  contributing factor that led to Germany's shift to renewable energy is past incidents with nuclear power.  Chernobyl and Fukushima have helped improve public acceptance for wind farm development by  increasing negative perception of nuclear power.     Both Germany and Ontario faced the same public concerns about health impacts, disruption of 

natural landscapes and harm to wildlife. The main difference between these two jurisdictions is how  Germany effectively dealt with public opposition in comparison to Ontario. The German government  worked with municipalities to create preemptive siting policies to ensure wind farm development met  the federal government's goals. German municipalities were given the ability to select suitable areas  and were included in wind farm planning processes. This policy and planning strategy differs from  Ontario's since municipalities and residents of Ontario had no input or power in the wind farm approval  process under the GEA. This lack of ability to participate and local autonomy generated public  opposition to wind farm development. The Scarborough Bluffs case study showcases this problem.     German policy making and planning strategy worked well to gain public acceptance, but these 

are not the only strategies used. The next section will discuss effective strategies used to create  appropriate incentives to encourage public acceptance of wind farm development.  

   

27 

 

Incentives
Incentives have been used as a method to increase positive attitudes and acceptance of wind  farm developments in both Ontario and Germany. Cooperative agreements would be considered an  incentive since both producers and communities would benefit in the arrangement. A comparison of the  incentives used by each of these governments will be discussed to determine which incentives have  been effective, ineffective, or require improvement. The main types of incentives to be discussed will be  economic, environmental, health, and community.  Environment Climate change is a direct result of the greenhouse gas emissions that have increased  unchecked.  The environmental incentive of using a renewable energy source is that there is a reduction  of SO2, NOx, and, CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. The emissions of these gases come primarily from  use of fossil fuels such as coal and oil.  In the last two decades, Germany has been able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and  continued to grow economically while remaining able to meet its Kyoto Protocol targets. Germany has  committed to a GHG reduction target of 40% below the 1990 levels by 2020 and set additional reduction  targets of 55% by 2030, 70% by 2040 and 80% to 95% by 2050, each relative to 1990 levels (IEA, 2013).  According to the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and  Nuclear Safety, approximately 146 million tonnes of CO2 were avoided through the use of renewable  sources in 2012. Electricity from renewable sources accounted for a reduction of 101 million tonnes  while heat from renewable energy sources accounted for a reduction of approximately 40 million tonnes  of CO2 equivalents. 

   

28 

 

The Ontario government stated that, as of 2011, coal power generation reached a 48year low  and CO2 emissions produced by coal power had been reduced nearly 90% between 2003 and 2011  (Government of Ontario, 2012).  The advantage of wind energy is that it produces virtually no emissions during turbine operation  and produces very little during the manufacturing, installation, and maintenance process (EWEA, 2012).  The European Wind Energy Association estimates that by 2020, Europe will have an annual savings of  215 million tonnes of CO2, annual savings of 261,000 tonnes of SO2, and an annual savings of 333,000  tonnes of NOx compared to the 2003 levels (EWEA, 2012). These environmental benefits result in  indirect benefits, such as health improvements and economic cost reductions.  Health In the Ontario Medical Association's 2008 study, Illness Cost of Air Pollution, it reported that air  pollution is a substantial cost burden to Ontario's health system and to the health of Ontarians. The  study found that air pollution was a contributing factor to 9,500 premature deaths in Ontario. It also  found that smog was responsible for approximately 16,000 hospital admissions in 2005 (Ministry of  Energy, 2012).  In 2004, the Ministry of Energy examined the health and environmental costs that were  associated with coal and wind power generation. The Ministry discovered that when health costs were  considered, coal power generation costs were 16.4 cents per kilowatt hour compared to 9.4 cents per  kilowatt hour for wind power (Green Energy Act Alliance, 2010).    While equivalent German health studies were not found, these health benefits could be inferred 

to be the same as Ontario's in terms of reducing pollutants in the environment. This reduction of  pollutants would lead to fewer people being hospitalized for respiratory issues related to poor air  quality. Germany is currently constructing coal plants to compensate for the loss of energy as nuclear      29   

power plants are decommissioned.  It may seem that the introduction of coal plants appears to counter  the health or environmental effects since fossil fuel emissions are released into the environment. The  new coal plants built in Germany are considered the most efficient coal plants in the world, and hold an  efficiency rating of 46% while the industry average is 35%38%. When comparing the most efficient coal  plant with the industry average, this efficiency rating translates to the same amount of electricity  generated while requiring 20% less coal and the result is a reduction of CO2 emissions by an annual 2.5  million metric tonnes (Franke, 2013).   Economy
Germany

In 2007, German renewable energy companies earned nearly 25 billion in revenue and  employed close to 250,000 individuals. Approximately 38% (94,000) of these jobs were directly related  to the German wind industry (Scheid, 2009). During the fragile economic climate in Europe during 2009,  Germany continued to invest approximately 20 billion in renewable energy developments. These  renewable energy investments stabilized Germany's economy by maintaining and creating jobs  (Anonymous, 2009).   Fossil fuel industries such as coal, have been considered in the transition as Germany moves  towards a low carbon economy. Figure 1 below illustrates a comparison of the number of jobs created in  the coal/conventional fuel industry and the renewable energy industry from 2005 to 2011.   

   

30 

 

 
Figure 1: Renewable Create More Jobs than Conventional Energy Does  Source: (Energy Transition, 2013) 

 

According to Figure 1 as of 2011 in Germany, there are approximately 380,000 jobs in the 

renewable energy sector. The types of jobs include roles in manufacturing, installation, and  maintenance. The steady increase in jobs in the renewable energy sector is quite remarkable  considering other European countries have faced economic strain during this time period. 
Ontario

The manufacturing sector in Ontario has declined in recent years. The Ontario government  believes that a shift in the manufacturing sector towards green energy jobs will revitalize Ontario's  economy. It is estimated that 50,000 new direct and indirect jobs will be created through the GEA  (Ministry of Energy, 2011). In 2010, Samsung, Siemens, and Canadian Solar Inc., announced the creation  of solar panel and wind turbine blade manufacturing facilities in Ontario. Approximately 1,400  manufacturing jobs will be created to help establish the renewable energy sector in Ontario (Ministry of  Energy, 2011). 

   

31 

 

As of May 2013, there have been approximately 31,000 jobs created through the GEA. The  majority of these jobs are in the manufacturing sector and did not exist five years ago (McEachern &  Stevens, 2013). According to the Canadian Wind Energy Agency, Ontario is projected to install more than  5,600 MW of wind energy capacity by 2018, resulting in the contribution of more than $1.1 billion of  revenue to municipalities across the province (CANWEA, 2013).  In addition, research and development is a becoming a highlycompetitive area in this sector.  According to the Ministry of Research and Innovation, there are twelve research institutions across  Ontario dedicated to alternative energy research and development. In 2005, the Ontario Centre of  Excellence for Energy was created to expedite research findings in the marketplace by creating  partnerships between academic researchers and private sector companies (Ministry of Research and  Innovation, 2013).

For the purpose of this study, community incentives are direct community benefits resulting  from wind farm or renewable energy development, and are in the form of reduced community service  costs (i.e. taxes, fees, etc.) or increase of services (i.e. new infrastructure, community programs, etc.).  In Germany, there are various types of owners of renewable energy facilities. Figure 2 below  shows over half of the installed renewable energy is owned at the community level by private  individuals and farmers. Local ownership leads to greater support for wind farms since the community  has a vested interest and is more likely to be part of the decisionmaking process to ensure wind farm  developments succeed (Breukers and Wolsink, 2007).

There is a significant contrast with Ontario where compensation is only provided to landowners  by developers and the neighbouring properties receive no incentives and benefits despite the perceived  impacts to their wellbeing and property value. This creates a polarizing situation where, because  neighbouring residents are not compensated, they are generally opposed to the project.

Communities in Germany realize the importance of renewable energy and have been willing to 

become involved in the renewable energy planning process. The combination of incentives and public  inclusiveness of wind farm planning has allowed successful implementation of wind farms in Germany.  For example, the city of Zschadraß's movement towards renewable energy was primarily a financial  decision. Approximately a decade ago, the city realized that energy costs were one of the largest  contributors to the city's community expenses. The mayor proposed the idea of the construction of a 

   

33 

 

CO2 neutral community gym after the first gym was destroyed by a flood. The 33% energy savings from  this new gym helped reduce rent for the local clubs that use the gym (Musall & Kuik, 2011).   Theökologischsoziale Bürgerstiftung, EcologicalSocial Citizens Foundation (ESCF), was created  by Zschadraß's residents and acts as a committee to make environmental decisions to improve the  community. The ESCF invested in solar photovoltaic installations in community buildings. The 17,000  in profits generated from selling the extra power to the grid were used to support community projects  such as providing a school lunch allowance for students who come from lowincome families (Musall &  Kuik, 2011).      In 2008, the local power company was aware of Zschadraß's renewable energy projects and  asked if the town would be interested in having some wind turbines installed in their community. The  community agreed and the ESCF acted as the community liaison for the project. The power company  and community financed the project together, which was worth 3.2 million. This partnership enabled  Zschadraß residents to have coownership of wind turbines where 20% belongs to the community and  80% belongs to the power company. Although 20% ownership does not seem a sizable amount, this  percentage amounts to 640,000 annually for the small community of 3,079 residents. Zschadraß is now  100% selfsufficient in local electricity from renewable power sources. The four wind turbines were  completed and operational in 2009 (Musall & Kuik, 2011). It is important to note that the community  gradually added other sources of renewable energy instead of relying on only wind energy. This  provided the community with the comfort of reliable renewable energy and the positive incentives  associated with it. 
Ontario

 

As stated earlier, the common owner for wind farms in Ontario is the wind developer, who has a 

direct compensation arrangement with the landowner. The typical agreement establishes a set amount 

   

34 

 

of compensation for the landowner in return for providing the land where the wind turbine would be  situated.  The Wolfe Island wind farm is located on Wolfe Island, Ontario, near Kingston. This 197.8 MW  wind farm began operation in mid2009 and consists of 86 wind turbines. The Wolfe Island wind farm  developers, TransAlta, and the Township of Frontenac Islands have an agreement where the Township  would be compensated at least $649,000 plus a percentage of revenue each year for 40 years  (Frontenac Islands, 2006). This money would be used to improve the community in the form of road  construction, beachbike paths, and new water treatment systems (Laing, 2013). It is unknown if there is  an arrangement for private landowners.    There has been very limited literature pertaining to community incentives in Ontario. The fact 

that there are no community owned wind farm developments in Ontario could be a contributing factor  to the negative attitudes and perceptions of wind farms in the rural areas where the majority of wind  farms are typically situated.  

InfrastructureandFeedInTariffs(FITs)
There is currently a considerable focus on and attention to wind farm development and  generation. It is important not only to look at development of wind farms, but at infrastructure and FITs.  Well planned and efficient energy infrastructure is essential to provide energy supply to the domestic  market and potentially future foreign markets. FITs is a mechanism used to rapidly develop renewable  energy production and provide funding for infrastructure.  The grid serves as an essential factor in wind power development. The grid delivers power from  the turbines directly to consumers. Therefore, the investment in transmission infrastructure and  network distribution for wind energy is essential to efficiently move energy through the grid to areas  which require this energy. Wind farms may be disconnected from the grid during high wind events due      35   

to excess supply to the grid and no capacity to harvest the excess power (Rajpurohit et al., 2008). The  projected share of renewable energy generation in the EU is expected to triple from current numbers by  2030 (Schroeder et al., 2013). For this reason it is imperative to investigate various infrastructure  approaches for all jurisdictions. Infrastructure strategies in terms of investment and taxes from Germany  and Ontario will also be examined.   This section examines policy differences between Germany and Ontario regarding infrastructure  and the effects it has on public acceptance or opposition. There are several factors that play a role in  providing proper energy infrastructure to the consumer. Decision makers must determine which wind  farm locations are optimal to provide stable energy production while also optimizing connection costs to  the grid. In addition, there are costs in connecting to and maintaining the grid which need to be  accounted for. These costs are passed onto the consumer which can lead to public opposition as energy  costs increase for individuals. As stated in the Methodology section, the FIT for each jurisdiction will  focus on determining each jurisdiction's strategy and their effectiveness. Also, how each FIT influences  public acceptance will be discussed.  InfrastructureGermany Although Germany is many years ahead of Ontario with respect to wind farm development,  Germany requires continuous investment in and development of the transmission of energy and  infrastructure to support it. As stated earlier, Germany has invested approximately 20 billion in  renewable energy installations. The power generated is useless unless there is a system to effectively  and reliably distribute it. Germany employs a FIT system to help developers to build, upgrade, and  maintain their infrastructure and wind turbines. German consumers have known for many years that the  cost of electricity is higher due to the use of renewable energy. Although the FIT program is successful in  financing maintenance of renewable energy systems, German consumers are absorbing the majority of 

   

36 

 

the costs which has started to become a burden. This has recently caused political debate in Germany  and has led to reexamination of the Energiewende (IEA, 2013).   The bottlenecks in these energy systems are the storage of renewable energy and its transport.  Getting the wind energy harvested from the northern coasts to factories and cities in the south requires  large scale "power superhighways" as the Germans call them. These routes must cross the boundaries  of Germany's 16 states, and be part of one integrated system. This integration is what is missing in  Germany's Energiewende. Another problem Germany is encountering with respect to the super highway  is varying support from different states. Some states, such as Thuringia, don't like new cables going  through their woods, whereas others, such as SchleswigHolstein, are making plans to become exporters  of wind energy, and other states, such as Bavaria, would prefer to be selfsufficient (Economist, 2013).     In 2012, the Energiewende was revised to improve approximately 2,900 km of existing 

transmission lines and build 2,800 km of new power lines to support this infrastructure demand  (Carrera, 2013). The estimated cost to complete the transmission line upgrade is 20 billion to 30  billion in the next ten years. These costs do not include upgrades to Germany's 870 distribution systems,  as renewable energy is provided to consumers through a distribution system rather than a transmission  system (Carrera, 2013). The cost of the distribution upgrade is expected to be between 27.5 billion to  42.5 billion (Carrera, 2013). It appears that Germany has started to focus its attention on both the  transmission and distribution networks.   The German government is also transitioning to a Smart Grid system. A Smart Grid system is an  advanced communication and control technology that manages the electrical grid. This system allows  greater flexibility and reliability by reducing service disruptions, and it has the management means to  incorporate renewable energy into the electrical grid. The purpose of these Smart Grids is to assist 

   

37 

 

consumers' energy conservation efforts, energy management costs, and integrate new technologies  such as electric vehicle charging stations (Government of Ontario, 2013b).   A Smart Grid can coordinate and distribute large power quantities from small power producers  leading to greater efficiencies from a management perspective. This will help improve grid automation  with realtime management for greater energy savings, reduce the cost of power over time, and  increase reliability from new sources of renewable energy (Ministry of Energy, 2013). As time passes and  infrastructure improves, renewable energy will be efficiently managed throughout the country.  InfrastructureOntario Ontario is in a similar situation to Germany in terms of infrastructure development and Smart  Grids implementation. The lack of investment in Ontario's energy infrastructure between 1995 and 2003  has set Ontario back in terms of reliability of supply in satisfying its electricity needs. Since 2003, the  Ontario government has invested over $7 billion to upgrade more than 5,000 km of transmission wires.  There continue to be plans drafted to increase transmission and infrastructure projects which would  allow more development of renewable energy (Ministry of Energy, 2013).   Ontario is set to invest approximately $2 billion over the next seven years to ensure the various  renewable energy sources can be reliably transmitted throughout Ontario. This investment is essential  since it is forecasted that approximately 4,000 MW of renewable energy will be incorporated into  Ontario's power grid in that time (Ministry of Energy, 2013).    Ontario is planning to raise electricity prices to help fund transmission and infrastructure 

upgrades. For example, it is projected that the industrial rate will increase by 2.7% over the next 20  years. Also, the residential electricity prices are expected to rise to approximately 7.9 % annually (or 46%  over five years) (Ministry of Energy, 2013). These price increases raise another argument for opponents 

   

38 

 

of wind farm development. Critics believe these price increases make wind energy less marketable  economically and that development should cease.     Germany and Ontario are quite similar in infrastructure development needs. Both jurisdictions 

realize the importance of investing in transmission and distribution infrastructure in order to effectively  and efficiently maximize renewable energy use. Ontario has recently allocated resources to upgrade its  infrastructure. However in the last two years, Germany has decided to invest in further infrastructure up  grades even though renewable energy has been used for almost 25 years. This could be a result of the  recent developments in SMART grid technology to effectively and efficiently manage and deliver energy  from various intermittent renewable energy sources (i.e. wind and solar). Presently, infrastructure does  not appear to have any direct influence on public acceptance and opposition in Ontario or Germany.   FeedInTariff Ontario and Germany have very similar approaches to their FIT programs and their plans for  infrastructure improvements. However, there are some differences in the effectiveness of their FIT  programs. The goal of a FeedInTariff (FIT) is to stimulate renewable energy development and generate  stable incentives for new investments in renewable technology (Mabee, 2012). A benefit of FIT is its  effectiveness in reducing costs per kWh as it reduces financial and regulatory risk (Stokes, 2013). A FIT  program must meet three criteria: a standard purchasing price per unit of supplied electricity (i.e.  $/kWh for Ontario and /kWh for Germany); that electric utility is required to buy all available  electricity; and a longterm contract (typically 1520 years) at a set price must be in place. Ontario and  Germany both meet these criteria with their FIT programs (Stokes, 2013).  FIT programs are also used to encourage innovation as they reduce the costs for research and  development. FIT costs should decrease with time if the program is properly employed. Another benefit  of FIT programs is that they provide investors with certainty and stability, as they decrease volatility in      39   

energy prices and risk premium when using renewable energy (Stokes, 2013).The FIT program also  enables participation from different types of stakeholders since it is not only restricted to large  renewable energy developers. FIT allows smallscale and community projects to benefit from renewable  energy projects (Mabee, 2012).  A drawback of the FIT program is the challenge for governments of setting the standard price.  Initially setting the price too low would lead to tariff increases in the future which would decrease  innovation and reduce public support (Stokes, 2013). 
FeedInTariffinGermany

Ontario and Germany's FIT program goals are practically identical. Germany's FIT goals consist  of ensuring secured renewable energy investment through guaranteed FIT and providing priority grid  connections to ensure prices for every kilowatt generated will be the same for next twenty (20) years.  The second goal is to encourage innovation by gradually reducing FIT since this will work to promote  competitiveness through technological innovation and research. Another goal is to prevent renewable  energy from becoming subsidized through taxes and passing the costs on to consumers (German  Renewable Energies Agency Information Platform, 2013). Based on these goals, Germany's FIT program  has been an important factor in the country's successful renewable energy development.    FIT provides desirable investment security for small coop groups, communities, and companies 

as it leads to locally retained profit. The combination of the FIT program and incentives provided by  wind farm development increases public involvement and leads to greater public acceptance of  renewable energy sources (Mabee, 2012).  Both jurisdictions' FIT programs possess the same criteria and their goals are similar with  respect to infrastructure upgrades, encouraging innovation, meeting environmental goals, generating  jobs and providing a guaranteed long term rate for renewable energy projects. This is no surprise as      40   

Germany was the first country to create the FIT program and Ontario adapted it to help grow their  renewable energy portfolio. 
FeedInTariffinOntario

Ontario's FIT program was created as an investment to retrofit the Province's aging electricity  infrastructure, enable the Province to meet their environmental goals, and to create jobs in order to  become prosperous (Böhringer et al., 2012). The Ontario government used the FIT program since it was  quite effective in increasing capacity quickly. The FIT programs removed barriers and encouraged  renewable energy growth as demonstrated in various jurisdictions around the world (i.e. Germany)  (Stokes, 2013). Therefore, FIT was an attractive way to expedite the development of renewable energy  in order to meet Ontario's 2014 coal power shutdown deadline.    The FIT price schedule was created based on the cost of generating electricity from each source 

plus a rate of return 10%  12% (as estimated by Ontario Power Authority). In 2009, the rate under the  new FIT program was 13.5 cents/kWh, increased from 11.5 cents/kWh under the original FIT program.  This rate increase resulted in an increase in large scale wind farm deployment (Stokes, 2013). The  combination of easy wind farm approval processes and favourable rates of return encouraged wind  developers to develop throughout the province. Although the Ontario government welcomed this  increase in wind farm development, public opposition to wind farm developments arose, as mentioned  earlier in the Policy and Incentives section (Stokes, 2013).  As mentioned above, Ontario is currently meeting its FIT goals by upgrading its aging  transmission infrastructure to be compatible with the new renewable energy production infrastructure,  thereby meeting its environmental goals by shutting down coal plants and creating jobs in renewable  energy.  However, one of the main criticisms of the Ontario FIT program is the inconsistent political  decision making experienced by both wind opponents and proponents. For example, wind farm 

   

41 

 

opponents criticized the FIT's price schedule since it was considered too high and resulted in  overburdening the consumer. The ratepayer funded FIT program was a large contributor to the recent  increases in electricity rates in Ontario. For wind farm proponents, the government's decision to place a  moratorium on offshore wind farms resulted in the cancellation of existing contracts, loss of potential  revenue, and a decrease in credibility (Stokes, 2013). The offshore wind moratorium will be discussed in  further detail in the Case Study section.  Another issue that FIT programs encounter is their transparent nature. This is an issue in the  sense that wind farm opponents can compare the cost of renewable energy to conventional energy  sources (i.e. natural gas, coal, nuclear etc.), allowing opponents to easily attack renewable energy costs  and subsidies while not acknowledging energy subsidies or tax breaks for fossil fuels (Stokes, 2013). For  instance, international support for renewable energy included approximately $88 billion in subsidies in  2011 while fossil fuel subsidies drew in $523 billion, approximately six times more than the former  (Stokes, 2013).    It is important to set the correct price rate since, if it is too high, consumers will complain the 

costs are too great, and if the rate is too low, investment in renewable energy will be negatively  impacted (Stokes, 2013). FIT adjustments are common because stability in these systems is often very  difficult to achieve. However, Ontario reviewed its FIT system in 2012 and plans to reduce the wind rate  from 13.5 cents/kWh to 11.5 cents/kWh (Ontario Power Authority, 2014).This lowers the price  compared to Germany, where the current German onshore rate is 0.09 /kWh, which translates to  approximately 14 cents/kWh CAD (Renewable International, 2014). These rates are solely given as a  general comparison as it is uncertain if these are accurately comparable. As stated in the Methodology  section, a price rate analysis is outside the scope of this study.

Germany and Ontario's FIT programs have similarities, but the implementation of their FIT  programs, combined with other factors, including policy decisionmaking, public participation, and  community incentives, has influenced public acceptance and opposition with respect to wind farm  development. Ontario's FIT program has the same framework as Germany but public criticism has arisen  based on governmental decisions. The Green Energy Act (GEA) and FIT program enabled wind farm  development to occur quickly throughout the province in order to satisfy the government's mandate.  However, the increase in development caused further tensions between wind farm opponents and  proponents. These tensions caused the FIT program and wind farm development to be scrutinized by  opposition groups with complaints of high energy bills, harm to human health, endangered wildlife, and  devaluation of property. In addition, the government's decision to impose an offshore moratorium  demonstrated their indecision and made the whole project and government less credible. These events  have led to a lack of trust in the Ontario government's energy policy.  Infrastructure and FIT do not have a direct impact on public acceptance or opposition. However,  when these factors are employed in conjunction with other factors such as policies and incentives,  public acceptance and opposition to infrastructure and FIT are easily subject to criticism due to their  transparent nature.   The next section will examine two case studies one from both Ontario and Germany which  demonstrate the effects of factors such as policy making, incentives and public participation, to illustrate  each proposal's successes and failures.  

CaseStudy
The German case study will demonstrate that a transparent process, equal distribution of  compensation, and consistent government decisionmaking influenced public acceptance to wind farm  development.       43   

GermanyZschadraßandNossenCaseStudy This German case study highlights the effectiveness of using proper incentives and public  inclusiveness during the siting process and can be compared to Ontario's wind farm development  situation. The study was conducted to compare two communities in Germany, Zschadraß and Nossen, in  order to observe attitudes towards wind turbine development within their respective communities.  These towns had different siting approaches and conflict management processes. Zschadraß went  through the siting approach typically employed in Germany where incentives and public inclusiveness  were included in the siting process. The community of Nossen had an approach similar to the one used  in Ontario where the public was excluded from the wind farm development process and incentives were  not distributed to the community. For example, Nossen town officials did not consider residents to be  stakeholders in the wind farm siting process. There was no community ownership of the wind turbines  installed in Nossen and residents were only compensated through a reduction of local taxes and rent  (approximately 7,800 in 2009). This compensation was not used for community funding of projects  (Musall & Kuik, 2011).    To support the study, Musall & Kuik conducted a survey with 100 residents from both Zschadraß  and Nossen to quantify the attitudes towards wind farm development within each respective  community. When residents were asked if noise was a disadvantage for wind turbines in Zschadraß only  15% of residents agreed, while in Nossen 44% responded that it was. The small number of Zschadraß's  respondents noted they were only affected by noise caused by wind turbines during certain weather  conditions. The respondents in Zschadraß reported the noise to be as bothersome as other impacts such  as landscapes and shadows. These reported impacts were quite bearable and less bothersome.  However, Nossen respondents perceived the same impacts as a clear disadvantage for wind turbine  development (Musall & Kuik, 2012). 

   

44 

 

The majority of Zschadraß's residents, 80%, believed that Germany should increase wind turbine  use while only 36% agreed in Nossen. Zschadraß residents were asked about their opinion of the local  wind turbines, and the results showed 62% of responses were positive, 36% were neutral, and 1% were  negative. Nossen had opposite results, 26% of the responses were positive, 47% were neutral, and 27%  were negative (Musall & Kuik, 2012).  Survey participants were asked if there was a relationship between the installations of  renewable energy in their community and building a better future for their children. Nossen's  respondents were mixed where 30% agreed with the statement and 25% were undecided, 37%  disagreed, and 8% did not know. Zschadraß's attitudes were definitive, 92% of respondents agreed, 6%  were undecided, and 2% disagreed (Musall & Kuik, 2011).  When respondents were asked about perceived transparency in the planning process, 53% of  respondents from Zschadraß believed the planning process was transparent, 37% did not know, 7%  disagreed, and 3% were undecided. Only 9% in Nossen agreed, 46% disagreed, 38% did not know, and  7% were undecided. Researchers believed the reason the response proportion for "did not know" was  high was due to the time restrictions (work schedule) respondents had during the planning process  (Musall & Kuik, 2011).     These responses display the contrast between the two communities' perceptions of wind 

turbines and the siting processes used within their communities. Zschadraß residents were more  positive toward wind turbines in their community since they did not experience conflict during the siting  process.   The acceptance survey between Zschadraß and Nossen further reinforced the benefits of a co operative siting process by removing conflict in asking residents about their attitudes and perceptions of  wind turbine development and the siting process. Overall, residents of Zschadraß had positive attitudes      45   

towards the planning process, wind turbine development in Germany, the important role it played in  their community, and the future of their children.  Negative factors from wind turbine development  such as noise, shadow, and detriment to landscape were more bearable and less bothersome to the  residents in comparison to residents in Nossen. The responses from Nossen's residents were a complete  contrast to Zschadraß. The residents had a lot of distrust of the siting process, negative attitudes for  wind turbine development in Germany and they did not believe wind energy would be beneficial to their  children. Factors such as noise, shadow, and detriment to landscape were all considered disadvantages  of wind turbines.    Ontario­ScarboroughBluffsOffshoreCaseStudy In 2006, Toronto Hydro proposed to build thirty (30) wind turbines offshore along the  Scarborough Bluffs in Lake Ontario (Doolittle, 2006). This number increased to sixty (60) wind turbines  across a twentyfive (25) kilometer stretch in Lake Ontario spanning from Ajax to the Leslie Street Spit  (Spears, 2008).The initial estimated height for these turbines was 100m and the wind turbines were  planned to be two (2) to four (4) kilometers offshore from the Scarborough Bluffs (Hamilton, 2009).  Hydro Toronto projected this distance would be optimal since winds this distance offshore tend to be  70% stronger (Spears, 2008). In 2010, the Liberal government announced the minimum setback for  offshore wind projects to be five (5) km (Marketwire, 2010).   In 2006, Toronto Hydro received approval from the Ministry of Natural Resources to install a  weather station that included an anemometer to measure wind speeds 1.2 km offshore. This weather  station would collect data for two years that would be analyzed to determine the suitability of the site  (Doolittle, 2006). Wind opposition groups stated this project was poorly planned since the weather  station would not provide suitable data to establish the feasibility of this location for offshore wind  development along the Scarborough Bluffs (Marketwire, 2010). The poor implementation of the 

   

46 

 

weather station gave wind opposition groups the perception that the project was being mismanaged  and it reinforced a lack of trust.   Scarborough Bluffs residents and wind farm opposition groups protested the development  based on the grounds that it would ruin the visual aesthetic landscape, reduce property value, and harm  birds (Hamilton, 2009). In November 2008, approximately one thousand people attended a public  information meeting presented by Toronto Hydro to discuss the wind farm project. An earlier meeting  was scheduled a month prior, but was cancelled as the venue was over capacity, and an additional two  hundred people were not able to attend. This meeting was considered very polarizing since outside  environmental groups transported wind energy supporters to the meeting. When outside stakeholders  are involved in community decisions, their attitudes, competence and agendas are scrutinized by the  affected community as they are not considered to have the same vested interests (Wüstenhagen et al,  2007). This caused Scarborough Bluffs residents to resent the project even more since the residents  would be the ones impacted (Spears, 2008). In 2010, two (2) local councillors, Paul Ainslie and Brian  Ashton, asked the province to impose a blanket moratorium on windpower development in Ontario  (Paperny, 2010). This demonstrated that the local government officials were against this project and  supported their respective constituents.   It is not clear whether residents along the Scarborough Bluffs would have been provided  compensation since these wind turbines were only visible in the distance. Assuming the same  compensation methods practiced elsewhere in Ontario and mentioned in the above Incentives section,  the residents would be considered neighbours and would not receive compensation. The lack of  incentives and benefits would be another factor leading to further opposition to the wind project.  Residents were opposed since they would be subjected to wind turbines supported by outside interest  groups, they would have no ability to reject the project and would not receive compensation. 

   

47 

 

The Scarborough Bluffs wind opposition group was relieved in February 2011, when the Liberal  government announced an offshore wind project moratorium due to environmental concerns.  Energy  Minister Brad Duguid explained additional research would be required due to the lack of research on  freshwater wind projects while land based wind projects have had extensive research. Wind farm  opponents and political opposition groups claimed this move was a politically motivated decision by the  Liberals to gain more support from urban areas and areas affected by offshore wind development  (Talaga, 2011).    Although the Scarborough Bluffs wind farm project was halted, the sight of the weather station  that was still collecting data angered wind farm opponents since it served as a reminder of the proposed  wind development project. The local government also attempted to intervene on behalf of the wind  farm opponents. ScarboroughEast Councillor, Paul Ainslie, who was against the wind farm  development, tried unsuccessfully to remove the weather station before its intended data collection  end date in August 2012 (Scarborough Mirror, 2013).   Although this wind farm siting process dealt with a proposed offshore wind turbine  development  which had a greater setback distance than land based wind turbines, there were several  similar key issues identified in this case study. This project was initiated by an outside party with  interests that were not parallel to those of the community, and the community did not participate in the  planning decisions that led to the wind farm development. There was a lack of local resident and  government support for this wind farm development project. This created a polarized environment  where residents did not trust any external groups who spoke to the community. The implementation of  the weather station was an example of poor planning that reinforced the mistrust of the residents. It  was also anticipated that residents would not receive any compensation or direct benefits for 

   

48 

 

proceeding with this project. All of these factors contributed the resident's opposition to wind  development along the Scarborough Bluffs.

When examining both Ontario and Germany's renewable energy history, it appears both jurisdictions  were quite different but they were similar in some respects. Germany determined renewable energy to      49   

be an important source of energy since it enabled Germany to be less reliant on foreign energy sources.  Ontario switched to renewable energy since there was a supply problem and a demand for renewable  energy. Both Germany and Ontario also recognized that renewable energy would be beneficial to the  environment and result in the reduction of GHG gas emissions. This was another reason that led to  Ontario's pledge to close all coal plants by 2014.  Germany has not shown any sign of slowing down wind farm developments since it utilizes wind  power from offshore sources. The limitation in Germany's planning strategy to site wind farm  developments only in areas approved by the municipality is that it restricts the number of locations  available for onshore wind farms. Ontario, on the other hand, has extensive available land for wind farm  development. It also has several large bodies of water that are potential sites for offshore wind farms.   An example where politics has affected policy choices and decisionmaking is the Ontario Liberal  government's decision on offshore wind farm development. Early in the mid2000s when renewable  energy initiatives were being explored, the Liberal government initially allowed offshore wind farm  developments to be proposed. Many studies were completed and investments made to enable offshore  development. However, as the case study revealed, in late 2011, the Ontario government imposed a  moratorium on offshore wind farm development and required proponents to conduct further scientific  research. The initial research to assess the potential impacts to wildlife and the physical landscape has  provided inconclusive results and the government recommended further research rather than lifting the  moratorium (Spears, 2013).  Germany was one of the first countries to pave the way towards large scale renewable energy in  terms of research and development, financing, policy development and planning. As stated in the above  sections, Germany experienced some growing pains in terms of financing and public acceptance issues.  Although Chernobyl played a large role in improving public acceptance of wind farm projects, the key

lesson learned to gain public acceptance was the collaborative planning effort in increasing public  participation and transparency. For example, the village of Feldheim has a high level of public  acceptance of wind turbines. A method employed to gain the community's trust was to include local  experts in the decision making process. For example in Feldheim, an insurance broker checked the  contract for legal details before local residents signed it, the head of the agricultural cooperative  monitored the financial gains and losses for the village, and some of the local technicians inquired about  the construction methods for and practices used in the project. Each of these local experts presented  their opinions about the project, in their respective areas of expertise, to the community. This made the  project more transparent and understandable to the community and this resulted in more trust in the  development (Kunze & Busch, 2011). These local experts also acted as representatives of the community  and voiced any concerns to the project proponents.    Germany realized there was a balance to be struck between fulfilling wind farm development  goals and gaining public acceptance. New policies and laws were developed or amended to satisfy both  renewable energy targets and public acceptance.     Ontario, having failed to learn the earlier lessons observable in Germany, started differently 

compared to Germany but is now beginning to use the same wind farm development strategies. Ontario  did not experience a catastrophic event as a trigger to move towards renewable energy. However, the  2003 summer blackout in Ontario served as an alarm that something needed to be done. As renewable  energy developments were planned, it became apparent that the existing Environmental Assessment  (EA) approval process took too long for wind farm developers. In addition, public opposition influenced  municipalities to use their power to reject wind farm development projects. The combination of the  2014 coal plant closure deadline, a lengthy EA approval process, mounting public opposition and the 

   

51 

 

power of the municipality, led the provincial government to create the GEA allowing renewable energy  projects to be built without these obstacles.    The Ontario GEA and the German energy planning laws both had the same intention to develop 

renewable energy including large scale wind farms but their approaches were different. The Germany  strategy was transparent in its approach, where the government concluded wind farm development was  vital to meet the country's future demands, but also included the public to determine where wind farms  could be built. The study comparison between Zschadraß and Nossen has shown that public  involvement is effective in order to gain public acceptance for wind farms. While the Ontario  government also promoted renewable energy development as a viable energy source to meet the  province's future energy demands, it created the GEA to combat the "NIMBYism" it experienced during  the EA process. However, this strategy caused additional tension between the government and wind  farm opposition groups. It is only recently that the Ontario government has shifted from a mandated  and forceful renewable energy strategy to the strategies used in Germany including public participation.  Additional studies are required to determine if these new amendments are effective in changing public  acceptance of major wind farm developments or if there are any lasting antiwind policy effects caused  by government decisionmaking.     The rates of increase of installed wind turbine capacity for Ontario and Germany have been 

almost similar based on the initial years of wind energy development. Germany's installed wind capacity  rate has eventually reached a plateau as time has progressed. Similarly, Ontario's rate of new installed  wind capacity may decrease due to new amendments in the GEA that promote smaller wind farm  developments and grant municipalities the power to accept or reject wind farm developments. There  has been no indication by the Ontario government to preemptively create selected wind farm  development sites, a planning strategy which has helped German wind farm development. Therefore, 

   

52 

 

Ontario wind farm proponents should focus on developing incentives and employing collective decision based strategies that were effectively utilized in Germany for wind farm development, since it will be  more difficult to obtain approval under the current policy.     In terms of incentives, both Ontario and Germany have shown that renewable energy and wind 

energy do have positive impacts on the environment and their own economies. These incentives will  reinforce the actions of these two jurisdictions to continue with wind farm development. The crucial  differences between the two jurisdictions are the types of community incentives.  As mentioned earlier, ownership in the wind farm plays a key factor in providing community  incentives since it ultimately determines which stakeholders receive compensation. Ontario wind  developers typically deal directly with the landowner who would receive the majority of the revenue.  This predictably causes tension in and resentment by adjacent property owners resulting in opposition  to wind farm development. German community ownership of wind farm developments varies from  private citizen groups, towns, and farmers to big energy companies, industry and banks. For example,  developers who have provided the community with access to shares have not only created a financial  incentive to support development but have also allowed participation and have given direct incentives  to the community (Jobert et al, 2007). Research has shown that there is an enhanced level of local  acceptance of wind farm development when there is community involvement, collective decision making and compensation involved (Breukers & Wolsink, 2007). The community has a vested interest to  ensure the wind farm development succeeds due to the collective benefits gained. However, in Ontario,  the neighbouring residents receiving no compensation do not care if the wind farm development  succeeds or fails since they have no incentives.  Both Germany and Ontario have committed to invest billions of euros or dollars in transmission  infrastructure and distribution networks in order to efficiently manage power supply and to meet      53   

energy demands. Germany is currently facing power management issues and it appears energy created  from wind farms has outpaced the capacity for transmission and distribution networks. It is unclear if  Ontario has learned a comprehensive policy lesson from other jurisdictions on the development of  renewable energy sources, the importance of collaborative energy management or if it has learned from  the 2003 summer blackout about the importance of investing in energy infrastructure.  The earlier mentioned policies, planning strategies and incentives have influenced the FIT  programs for each of these jurisdictions. Although FIT programs themselves do not have a direct impact  on public acceptance or opposition, FIT programs are easily criticized due to poor implementation of  policies and incentives, public acceptance and opposition to infrastructure as revealed in Ontario.  Therefore it is essential for policies, planning strategies, community incentives and public participation  to be included in the siting process to ensure public acceptance of wind farm development will be  achieved.   Limitations   There were several limitations in this study. Due to Ontario's recent transition to renewable   

energy, there was limited access to all of the relevant academic publications and case studies about  wind farm development and perceptions in the province. There was also the lack of community owned  wind farms to determine how effective they would be in improving public acceptance in Ontario.   FurtherStudies   Ontario is moving to a low carbon economy since renewable sources and nuclear power 

releases virtually no carbon emissions. However, there are some negative connotations associated with  nuclear power such as the potential for major catastrophic events caused by nuclear meltdowns or the  radioactive waste created from the nuclear power process.   

   

54 

 

Further research should be conducted to determine if Ontario's nuclear power program will  have any influence on Ontario's renewable energy development or if nuclear power will act as a  hindrance to wind farm development and growth.  Ontario currently relies on nuclear energy as a non carbon emission source and the 2010 Long Term Energy Plan does not include any plans to  decommission any nuclear power plants. Ontario has recently committed to refurbishing several of its  nuclear power plants and the refurbishment of the Darlington nuclear power plant reinforces Ontario's  decision to continue to use nuclear energy to power the province.   Another factor to consider is the energy source differences between Ontario and Germany. As  previously stated, coal energy in Ontario has been reduced to provide less than 5% of Ontario's energy  production. Now that Ontario has met its intended goal, this may explain why Ontario has amended the  GEA from an aggressive renewable development strategy to a controlled transparent renewable energy  process. 

Conclusions
  Germany has demonstrated that successful wind farm development requires effective 

government policy, planning strategies, community incentives, investment in infrastructure and a clearly  defined FIT program. While Ontario has the same goal of developing renewable energy within its  jurisdiction, it has demonstrated that it has not been as effective in managing public acceptance  compared to its German counterpart.  PolicyandPlanning   German renewable energy policy was greatly influenced by certain historical events such as the 

oil energy crisis in the 1970s. However, one of the most influential factors which strengthened German  renewable energy policy making and public acceptance was the Chernobyl nuclear incident. Renewable  energy funding was planned to be cutback and public opposition of nuclear power was evenly divided      55   

before the Chernobyl nuclear incident. Due to the devastating effects, impacts and close proximity of  Chernobyl to Germany, public opposition to nuclear power grew to 70% and this helped drive Germany  to renewable energy development. Ontario never experienced any nuclear catastrophes and was too far  away to experience the impacts from Chernobyl to trigger a strong response from the public to create  policies to transition to a renewable energy economy.     German planning strategies worked quite well to gain public acceptance. The main difference 

between these two jurisdictions was that Germany was able to effectively manage public opposition  whereas in comparison to Ontario public opposition played a major role in curtailing wind power  development. The German government worked with municipalities to create preemptive siting policies  to ensure wind farm developments that were needed to meet the country's renewable energy and  environmental goals were available. German municipalities were given the ability to select suitability  areas that were to be included in the wind farm planning process. This policy and planning strategy is  quite different compared to those in Ontario since municipalities and residents under the GEA had no  input in to or power to affect the wind farm approval process. This lack of local autonomy and  community participation generated public opposition to wind farm development.  The Ontario government is beginning to show signs of transitioning from an aggressive wind  farm developing government to a government willing to cooperate with the municipalities and  communities through its amendments to the GEA. The Liberal government may have realized it would  be beneficial to rebuild relationships with the communities that were subjected to wind farms in order  to increase wind farm acceptance for future potential communities. The original GEA approvals process  allowed wind farm developers to receive approvals without experiencing any public opposition and  conflict. This original policy, which has been imposed for the past five years, has created a large divide 

   

56 

 

between Ontario communities and the government. It may take time for communities to regain trust in  the government and change their attitudes to wind farm development in Ontario.   Incentives Community incentives are effective in gaining public acceptance for wind farm development.   Community incentives provide the opportunity for community ownership, an important factor, since the  benefits are distributed throughout the community which leads to acceptance and approval for wind  farm development. Community members are more involved and feel that they have a vested interest to  ensure the project succeeds. The case study of Zschadraß and Nossen demonstrated local acceptance of  wind farm development when there was community involvement, collective decisionmaking and  distributed benefits for the whole community. These incentives led to positive experiences and attitudes  and resulted in other communities wanting to join in wind farm developments. As stated earlier, over  100 German municipalities set community goals to use more locally produced renewable energy. In  order for these goals to be successful, it is essential for these municipalities to use the community based  approach to avoid the problems encountered in Nossen. This approach is effective for siting and gaining  public acceptance since it incorporates a proactive process in managing and preventing conflict.   In Ontario, wind developers typically interact directly with landowners who in turn receive  compensation. The result of this unequal distribution increases opposition since there is tension and  resentment from adjacent property owners. Further reexamination and amendments to the GEA to  address community distribution of benefits would provide more incentives for communities to accept  wind farm developments. The next priority for Ontario and wind farm developers is to create better and  more direct incentives for wind farm communities as demonstrated by their German counterpart.

Infrastructure&FeedInTariff In terms of infrastructure, both Germany and Ontario had the same goals to invest and upgrade  their existing transmission and distribution infrastructure. Germany and Ontario's FIT programs had  similar goals regarding innovation promotion, infrastructure upgrades, job creation, meeting  environmental goals and providing a guaranteed long term rate for renewable energy projects. The FIT  programs have been successful in developing wind energy within their respective jurisdictions. However,  it is important to note that policy, planning, and community incentive factors must cater to the public's  needs since they are vital in the successful implementation of FIT programs.  As provinces in Canada begin to adopt wind energy developments as elements in their  renewable energy policies, effective and ineffective strategies employed by Ontario and Germany could  serve as a template for other Canadian jurisdictions to learn lessons from these experiences to improve  their own wind farm development processes, gain public acceptance and mitigate opposition. Ontario's  wind farm development future remains uncertain since its past strategies may have created permanent  negative attitudes, and since it is uncertain whether current or future strategies will redeem the public's  trust in wind farm development.
