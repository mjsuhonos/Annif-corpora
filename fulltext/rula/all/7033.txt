Abstract Interpreting Bert Hardy's Photographic Collection at Art Gallery of Ontario Master of Arts 2017 Guanchen Yu Film and Photography Preservation and Collections Management (FPPCM) Ryerson University, Toronto

This subject of this thesis is a collection of Bert Hardy photographs donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) in 2007. Hardy (1913-1995), worked as a photojournalist for Picture Post from 1940 - 1957 during which time he covered many aspects of British life after World War II. Hardy's contribution to British visual culture is traced in three chapters beginning with a literature survey that covers the context of his work in post-war British society. The second chapter gives a full description of the collection and further analyzes the style of Hardy's photographs. The third chapter examines the history Picture Post and the context in which its editors worked. Looking at the the relationship between photographers and editors in the picture press, it examines how Stefan Lorant and Tom Hopkinson edited and captioned Bert Hardy's photographs for use in the Picture Post.

1. Introduction The collection of Bert Hardy (1913-1995) photographs at the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) was anonymously donated in 2007. The collection includes 387 gelatin silver prints along with 57 photocopied sheets of Picture Post magazine from different issues which included images by Bert Hardy, and spans from 1940 to 1959. There are three main parts of the collection: 276 photographs of British life during and after the Second World War, 30 photographs of the Korean War, and 64 photographs of daily life in Western Europe. In addition, there are 5 photographs of the Far East and 13 photographs from Cyprus in the AGO collection. This thesis focuses on how Hardy's photographs contributed to British visual culture. It will examine the style of Hardy's work in the collection at the AGO and how his work was reproduced in Picture Post in the 1940s and 1950s. Bert Hardy was a British photojournalist who worked for Picture Post between 1940 and 1957.1 When he was young, Hardy worked as a photojournalist for a bicycle magazine, Bicycle. He later joined the General Photographic Agency (GPA) then founded his own company, Criterion Press.2 Hardy's work covers several historical moments in the twentieth century, in different regions of the world. For example, he covered the D-Day landing of World War II, conflict during the Korean War, and the royal wedding of Queen Elizabeth II. Hardy was also assigned to photograph the condition of ordinary people's lives during and after the war.3 Three

of his photographs about ordinary people were selected for Edward Steichen's famous exhibition The Family of Man in 1955 an exhibition in which Steichen selected 503 photographs from 68 countries.4 Sir Tom Hopkinson, the second editor of Picture Post said that Hardy was a humanist photographer.5 The fact that three of Hardy's photographs were selected in the Family of Man exhibition emphasizes this point.6 This paper aims to explore how Bert Hardy's photographs contributed to British visual culture. It commences with a literature survey covering the context of te post-war society in Britain, photojournalism, and Bert Hardy's professional life before and during the Picture Post years. The second chapter, "Bert Hardy's Photographic Collection at the AGO," gives closer observations and descriptions of the AGO collection. The thesis continues by defining the style of Hardy's photographs. The last chapter, "Bert Hardy's work at Picture Post," examines the use of Hardy's photographs in the magazine to show the relationship between photojournalists and editors at the time and the role of Picture Post in the dissemination of visual news. An illustrated list of the full collection is included as an appendix.

Literature Survey This literature survey considers texts written about Bert Hardy's life and career, the context

in which he was working, and the magazine he worked for, Picture Post. Divided into three sections, this review examines the different contexts of the post-war British society, Picture Post, and Bert Hardy's professional life. First, the survey discusses the social and cultural background informing Hardy's work. Then, it analyzes the work in the context of photojournalistic practice and Picture Post, where Hardy's work was frequently reproduced. Lastly, the review gives a general context of Hardy's professional life. 2.1 Post-war British Society A knowledge of post-war British society contributes to the understanding of Bert Hardy's photographs, specifically his images of British civil life. What kind of subjects did he focus on, and why? The book Understanding Post-War British Society presents different perspectives from a group of distinguished sociologists and social historians who interpret British society during that specific period.7 In the book's essay "Poverty in Post-War Britain," Joan C. Brown discusses the status of the post-war British society and the common wish of the people at the time to "endow people with rights, emphasizing opportunities rather than coercion, social security, solidarity, and offering dignity to the poor."8 It provides a social context for Bert Hardy's photographic work by exploring the social background of Post-war Britain. Since the

subject of 274 photographs in the collection concerns the British people during and after the war, this book illuminates the characteristics of Hardy's work in a social perspective. The essay "The Social Eye of Picture Post" written by the political activist, sociologist, and cultural theorist Stuart Hall, analyzes Picture Post extensively in terms of its social role and characteristics in British photojournalism.9 The author argues that the photograph is only one aspect of the magazine. The use of captions within the magazine balances the photograph and the narrative about the event.10 2.2 Picture Post The book Photography and Society written by German photojournalist Gisèle Freund discusses the technological developments of photojournalism as well as works by different photographers in 1920s and 30s.11 In the chapter "The Birth of Photojournalism in Germany," the author discusses the emergence of illustrated magazines in Germany in the 1920s, and she uses examples of Berliner Illustrirte and the Münchner Illustrierte Presse to define the beginning of what many think of as the golden age of modern photojournalism.12 Picture Post editor Stefan Lorant is discussed extensively here, presented as the inventor and developer of the photostory format after he became the editor in chief for Münchner Illustrierte Presse in 1930.13 Freund claims him to be "the one who influenced photographers and began to fill entire pages of

the magazine with groups of photographs on a single subject... he was the first to realize that the public not only wants to be informed about famous personalities, but is also interested in subjects concerning everyday life."14 This idea became one of the factors in the success of Life, the American weekly picture magazine, founded later in 1936.15 Lorant became the first editor of Picture Post in 1938 after he left Germany for Britain. Freund's explanation of Lorant's ideas and his role as editor helps the reader understand the way Picture Post dealt with photographs. The book Photojournalism, published by Time-Life Books further recognizes the importance of Lorant to photojournalism. In the chapter "Stories in Pictures," the editors of the book show the evolution of the the photographic story format in picture magazines. Stefan Lorant is mentioned again in this volume for his contribution to "galvanizing the American publishers."16 And he is referred to as an individual who "pioneered photojournalistic techniques."17 Picture Post is mentioned as well as an example of "the new picture magazines" in the UK.18 It uses the example of Lorant creating a sequence of Robert Capa photographs of the Spanish Civil War by numbering each image, thus guiding the reader through the story.19 Kiosk: A History of Photojournalism edited by Bodo von Dewitz and Robert Lebeck contains a large number of illustrations, layouts, and historical narratives on photographic magazines from 1839 to 1973.20 In the chapter "Wartime reporting 1936-1945," Lorant is

mentioned as one of the innovators of the new designs for photographic publications.21 This book also states that the American magazine LIFE was modeled on the German illustrated magazine Berliner Illustrirte.22 Furthermore, in the chapter "The Postwar Years 1945-1949," the author points out that the style of international photojournalism after the war was influenced massively by German émigrés. Just as Lorant joined Picture Post from Germany, the German-born photojournalist Kurt Hutton and Felix H. William joined Picture Post as members of the photography team.23 Kurt Hutton also worked for Life, showing that there are similarities in their careers. The connection between Picture Post and other magazines therefore can be established. Picture Post is also the only British photographic magazine mentioned in this book, which shows the importance of Picture Post in the history of photojournalism. The book Getting the Picture: The Visual Culture of the News includes several historians' view of photojournalism from different historical perspectives. The essay "Never Alone: Photo Editing and Collaboration," written by Nadya Bair, discusses the collaboration between photographers, photographic agencies, and magazines.24 The author emphasizes the importance of reviewing not just the work of photographers when studying the field of photojournalism, but also photo editors and photographic editing. She believes that it is the "photo editors who shaped the content and form of photojournalism" and so the history of the medium as well.25 Picture

Post is also mentioned in a discussion about the use of a famous portrait of Robert Capa in the magazine to increase the recognizability and fame of the photographer in order to boost the publication's readership.26 The author also speaks about the relationship between photo editors and photographers. Photo editors would consider the personal interests and skills of photographers and request specific formats of photographs.27 Meanwhile, photographers would overshoot the assignments to please editors.28 This meant that photographers would photograph a lot more than what editors expected, giving them a lot more to work with. This source helps contextualize the relationship between photographers and magazine editors. In addition to the discussion of photojournalism during and after the war, the context in which Picture Post operated is very important in order to understand the historical role of Bert Hardy and the use of his work. The book Stefan Lorant: Godfather of Photojournalism, written by Michael Hallett, Lorant's biographer, documents Lorant's professional life from his early years in Hungary to his final days in the United States.29 In the chapter "A Symphony of Photographs," the author gives the historical context for the formation of Picture Post and speaks of Picture Post as "one of the earliest popular pictorial magazines in England." He further claims that "other pictorial publications targeted the upper classes but Picture Post `appealed to the common man.'"30 Hallett states that "Lorant puts his ideas on paper only after he developed

them in his head... and he made all the decisions by himself."31 According to Hallett, the power of the editorship resided with Lorant when he was the editor-in-chief at Picture Post. Hallett also states that Picture Post "was a continuation of Lorant's work as editor of the Münchner Illustrierte Presse, of the Sunday magazine Pesti Napló, and of Weekly Illustrated."32 The author gives credit to the editorial experience which Lorant brought to Picture Post. The thesis "Reading Magazines: Stefan Lorant and Picture Post, 1939-1941: A Study of the Picture Editor's Work from the Archive of Modern Conflict's Collection" discusses how Picture Post editors constructed visual stories in the magazine's early days.33 The author, Hila Cooper, compared the first and second editors of the magazine, Stefan Lorant and Sir Tom Hopkinson respectively. The author also discusses the arrangement and composition of photographic essays under Lorant's editorship, which had a significant influence on the editorship of Hopkinson afterwards.34 The thesis provides references about editors' power and the relationship between editors and photographers. It helps explain the use of Hardy's photographs in the magazine by analyzing the directions taken by different editors. The book Picture Post 1938-50 was edited by Sir Tom Hopkinson, Lorant's successor and the editor of Picture Post from 1938 to 1950.35 Hopkinson initiated Bert Hardy's connection with Picture Post. This book provides historical context for the magazine, and narratives about

the way Picture Post handled photographs under Hopkinson. It also gives Hopkinson's opinion on why Picture Post was ultimately closed. The rise of television accelerated the rate of decline of traditional media, but the poor management by decision makers was the real cause of Picture Post's closure.36 The conflict between editors and the owner of the magazine was intense and the price was changed often between 1951 and 1952 after Hopkinson's resignation.37 These inner changes caused the decline of Picture Post in the 1950s. Makers of Photographic History, a journal published by the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in association with the Hulton-Deutsch Picture Library contains a record of a symposium held in 1989. Harold Evans, the former editor of the London Sunday Times and the Times interviewed Bert Hardy and Sir Tom Hopkinson. They talked about some historic moments of Picture Post and their impact, both personally and professionally.38 Hardy and Hopkinson discussed opinions on the issues attending to the Korean War that Hardy photographed. The story covered caused a lot of drama. The way Hardy's photographs were used and the meaning they originally were intended to to convey was changed to express only the positive attitudes of the UN forces. The record of the interview shows their perspective on this incident. It also shows how a photograph's original meaning can be changed by editorship after the fact.

2.3 Bert Hardy Bert Hardy's autobiography titled Bert Hardy: My Life covers his personal and professional life in different stages and his first-hand perspectives on war and the people he encountered.39 The narrative of this book follows a chronological order, with relevant details. From this autobiography, it can be seen that Hardy was a passionate photojournalist..40 Graham Harrison wrote another essay that provides information on Bert Hardy's professional life in 2008, "The Life and Times of Albert Hardy (1913-1995)."41 This essay provides the context for several important historical points of Hardy's career: for example, the details of how he was introduced to Picture Post, the first work of Hardy's used by the magazine, and the controversy about his photographic stories covering the Korean War.42 In terms of analyzing the work of Bert Hardy, Glenn Jordan and Hardy's 'Down the Bay': Picture Post, Humanist Photography and Images of 1950s Cardiff explains why Bert Hardy's photographs are seen as humanist, using examples of photographs taken by Bert Hardy in Tiger Bay, Cardiff in 1950.43 These photographs focus on the people in this area, and the subjects generally emphasize the poor. The book Photojournalism 1855 to the Present: Editor's Choice, edited by Reuel Golden, gives an overview of photojournalism since 1855.44 In the introduction, Golden discusses the historical context of photojournalism. Several important photographers are

included, such as Lewis Hine, Robert Capa, and Henri Cartier-Bresson, among others. Bert Hardy is included as well as a figure in the history of British photojournalism.45 The author regards Bert Hardy's work as one of the high points of British photojournalism. For example, Golden gives credit to Hardy's ability to communicate with ordinary people and "make intimate and revealing images that seem like a slice of life was becoming all-important."46 This book helps clarify the style of Hardy's work. As a staff photographer for Picture Post, Hardy worked in the larger tradition of narrative photojournalism. In the history of photojournalism, there are other photojournalists and magazines that also transmitted and carried on this tradition throughout most of the 20th century. The book Photography Within the Humanities documented a symposium held at Wellesley College in the 1970s, which included presentations by and dialogues with photographers, filmmakers, editors and curators on photography.47 This symposium provided an important larger context for understanding Bert Hardy's work and its place in the history of photojournalism. The husband of Dorothea Lange, professor Paul Schuster Taylor, described how the famous photograph Migrant Mother was taken and the effects of reproducing the photograph in the different publications as an example of how photographs could move people and create unexpected influence.48 In the discussion with John Szarkowski, Taylor also mentioned Dorothea Lange and Migrant Mother. He mainly spoke about the use of this

photograph in publications and the editing choices made by those publications. The photograph was doctored in different magazines to emphasize certain aspects, such as the poverty of the subject, just as some of Hardy's photographs were edited before publishing. In another chapter, photographer W. Eugene Smith gave his opinion on why Life magazine folded, which he believed was caused by the lack of thoughtfulness and depth in the editing of the magazine.49 Smith also shows the conflict between him and Life on the content of stories he photographed.50 Examples like this help to contextualize the relationship between Hardy and Picture Post.

The Bert Hardy Photographic Collection at the AGO The AGO collection of Bert Hardy's photographs was donated in 2007 by an anonymous

donor who purchased the collection from Hardy's estate, overseen by his widow Sheila Hardy, in 2003. The collection consists of 387 black and white gelatin silver prints along with 57 photocopied sheets of Picture Post magazine, and spans the time period from 1940 to 1959. There are three main parts in the collection: 276 photographs of British life during and after World War II, 30 photographs of the Korean War, and 64 photographs of daily life in Western Europe. There are also 5 photographs of the Far East and 13 photographs of people in Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean.

Fig. 1: Nine boxes containing the photographic collection of Bert Hardy at the AGO.

The collection covers the entire period of Bert Hardy's photojournalistic work at Picture Post from 1941 to 1957. The photographs are contained in nine boxes in a chronological order (Fig. 1). There are six advertising photographs taken by Hardy in 1955 and 1959, and 10 photographs for Lilliput in 1958 besides photographs for Picture Post.

13

Three kinds of print formats can be found in the collection. The largest size is approximately 38cm x 30.5cm, the medium size is approximately 30cm x 25cm, and the small size is approximately 20cm x 16cm. On the back of the photographs, three kinds of stamps crediting Bert Hardy can be seen. One is a smaller size stamp of Bert Hardy's name in black ink, another one is a green stamp with his name and address, and the last one is printed "property of Bert Hardy" with address underneath in black ink. For the photographs taken for Picture Post, the credit stamp of Picture Post can be found as well (Fig. 2). Some photographs have more than one stamp on the back to indicate that the credit goes to both Bert Hardy and Picture Post.

Fig. 2: Bert Hardy stamps, and Picture Post credit stamp.

In addition to the stamps on the back, there is handwriting on most photographs (Fig. 3). The handwriting often regards the title of the photographs, location name, dates, a brief description, measurements, and enlargement percentages.

Image on left- Fig. 3: Handwriting on the back of photographs. Image on right- Fig. 4: Paper captions on the back of photographs

A few photographs also have paper captions stuck on the back (Fig. 4). These contain the number of the photograph in the sequence, a brief description, photographer's name, copyright, date, the use for which magazine, publishing status, and category. This information can help users track the photograph in the collection and how it was used in the magazine. 3.1 Photographs of British People during and after the War The largest part of the collection consists of 276 gelatin silver prints of the British people during and after the war and ranges from 1940 ­ 1959. These photographs were selected for use in 40 photographic stories in Picture Post published between 1940 and 1957. Besides the photographs taken for the magazine, six photographs were shot for advertisements. One is used for a Strand Cigarettes advertisement in London in 1959 (Fig. 5), and the other five were taken for Esso Petroleum at the River Thames in 1955 (Fig. 6).

In the collection, two photographs are mounted to paper boards (see Figs. 7 and 8). On the back of one mounted photograph, there is handwriting that reads, "Gorbals, Jan 31, 1948, p15 Lecture, A4617-57, Join up, and 2007/972." (Fig. 9) "Gorbals" refers to the poorest part of Glasgow, the location of the picture, the date refers to the issue of Picture Post, and "p15" refers to the page number of Picture Post that this image appeared on. "Lecture," however, is not understandable due to lack of information. It could refer to the use of the photograph. "A4617-57" refers to the donor's inventory number. "2007/972" refer to AGO's accession number. 3.1.1 British People during the War The photographs of British people taken during the war include nine photographs published in four issues of Picture Post between 1940 and 1942. Hardy was still working for his own freelance company, Criterion, in 1940, when he was commissioned to photograph for Picture Post.51 Hardy was also often sent to photograph the aftermath of the Blitz and the ruins of London during the war. Six photographs that Hardy took show the people in London after the bombing by the German Air Force in 1940 (Figs. 10-12). He focused specifically on citizens in different generations and their reactions after the bombing. Hardy recalled in his autobiography, "The spirit of the people was tremendous, and there was a strong determination to carry on as if nothing had happened."52 His images visualized the spirit of the British people during the war.

As illustrated above, Hardy photographed people of different ages. Hardy chose various shooting distances to show the people and the bombed ruins. In one image showing a woman and child, the shooting distance is relatively close, to focus on the expressions on their faces (Fig. 10). They look very worried and distressed. On the other hand, he also used greater shooting distances in order to show not only his subjects but the environment of the ruins (Fig. 12). The contrast between the ruins in the foreground and the complete houses in the background grounded by the small figures in the center of the scene emphasizes the situation after the bombing. Bert Hardy was recruited by Sir Tom Hopkinson and officially joined Picture Post on

20

March 3, 1940.53 One of the most recognizable photographs by Hardy shows firefighters in the London Blitz commissioned by Picture Post in 1941(Fig. 13).

Fig. 13: Bert Hardy, Two London Firefighters, 1941, Gelatin silver print, 29.8 x 24.3 cm. Collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario, 2007/949.

The firefighters stare in the same direction. Hardy chose to photograph the subject from below. This makes the two figures look bigger and gives clues to Hardy's attitude towards the subjects, showing their bravery and fearlessness. The subjects cover most of the background. There is a high contrast between the dark background and bright foreground; the light is mostly reflected by the faces and hands of the two firefighters. This also suggests that Hardy wanted to emphasize the faces of the firefighters rather than their surroundings. This picture earned Hardy the first

ever credit given to a photographer in Picture Post.54 Sir Tom Hopkinson ended with this caption when the images were published: "From the rule of anonymity we except these pictures. They were taken by A. Hardy, one of our photographers."55 3.1.2 British People after the War The photographs of post-war British people include 267 gelatin silver prints taken from 1947 to 1959. As mentioned before, six are advertising photographs in 1955 and 1959. 251 photographs were taken for Picture Post between 1947 and 1958, and ten photographs were used for the Lilliput magazine in 1958. Two years after Hardy joined in Picture Post, he became a photographer in the Army Film and Photographic Unit (AFPU) from 1942 to 1946.56 The photographs he took for the AFPU are not part of the collection at AGO. The photographs of the British people after the war in the collection were taken from 1947 onwards, after he returned to Picture Post. Hardy traveled to different cities and regions in the United Kingdom, such as Chelsea, Liverpool, Nottingham, River Tyne, Cardiff, and Glasgow. He photographed London the most because Picture Post and he were both based there. A photograph taken in the Elephant and Castle, London has a paper tissue covering its surface (Fig. 14).

Collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario, 2007/1167.

From these six photographs, it can be seen that Hardy photographed his subjects using different focal distance and from different positions. For example, Hardy shot the subjects with a
26

relatively wide perspective (Figs 19-21). The relationship between the subject and the environment is clear. The white hat and dress worn by the woman and the patient lying on the bed indicate the female subject is a nurse (Fig. 19); the aprons worn by the women and the building with chimneys in the background suggest that they are workers (Fig. 20); the hockey stick held in the man's hand and the ice floor underneath him would suggest the man is a hockey player (Fig. 21). Hardy used close distance to show the characteristics of the subjects (Fig. 22 and 23). Emotionally, this provides a kind of closeness between the audience and the subjects in the images. Hardy photographed the subject at a close distance to focus on the gesture and facial expression (Fig. 22). The light on her face creates a strong contrast with her black clothes and gloves. The close-up emphasizes the facial expression of the old lady. A high contrast between brightness and darkness also creates a kind of toughness in the subject. A lower point of view also creates a strong description of the old woman's facial characteristics (Fig. 23). By cropping the background, Hardy forces the viewer to focus on the subject. In figure 24, from a series of photographs of dancers, Hardy did not solely focus on the dancers dancing in the practice room or on stage (Fig. 25). Instead, he also chose to make photographs of intimate moments in the life of a dancer.

27

Fig. 25: Bert Hardy, Ann Sullivan in Rehearsals, 1952, Gelatin silver print, 30 x 38 cm. Collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario, 2007/1155.

He photographed the body of the dancer with a soft light shining through the window. A beautiful line of light is created on the body of the dancer through her negligee (Fig. 24). The audience thus could appreciate her identity as a dancer from another angle. In addition to people with different jobs and backgrounds in Britain, the lower class was what Hardy photographed the most. According to Hardy's autobiography, he went to photograph the poor in various places in the United Kingdom.57 For example, he went to photograph poor people in the Gorbals, Glasgow in 1948, and the Elephant and Castle area in London in 1949. One year later, he went to cover the conditions of the poor living at the River Tyne. After time spent covering the Korean War in 1950, Hardy went to photograph the poor areas in Cardiff,

57

Hardy, Bert Hardy, 104. 28

Wales in 1954 and Londonderry, Northern Ireland in 1955. All of these photographs can be found in the AGO collection. 85 photographs described above are among the 267 photographs in this section. Approximately one third of the photographs are of the poor. In the Gorbals series, Hardy photographed older men, African or Caribbean men, women, mothers holding infants, and children. Hardy's photographs show people smiling rather than focusing on the poor conditions and the extent of the poverty in that area. For example, one of the photographs is a close-up of a man smiling (Fig. 26). He appears happy and is smiling, but the wrinkles on his face, blurred eyes, and his tattered cap suggest that he was poor. The attitude of the subject is positive through Hardy's lens.

29

Among all of the photographs from the Gorbals series, the group that Hardy photographed most were the children. According to Hardy's autobiography My Life, he commented on an image of two boys in the street, "My favorite picture: this reminds me of what I was like when I was a kid. In this story I concentrated on the children, and how they kept their spirits up in conditions which were often dreadful."58 (Fig. 27)

Fig. 27: Bert Hardy, Two Boys Walking on a Gorbals Street, 1948, Gelatin silver print, 27 x 37.5 cm. Collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario, 2007/981.

The two boys are walking down the street and holding hands, looking naïve and curious. The lower point of view suggests an equal position with the subjects. He shows them as average children, playing and smiling, rather than as victims of poverty.

58

The locations that Hardy chose were also interesting. He focused not only on where the children were living and buying food, but also where they played, for example showing a child at the graveyard, playing leapfrog over the tombstones (Fig. 28).

A boy and a graveyard do not often exist simultaneously in the same picture in daily life. A graveyard often represents death and the end; here, however, it becomes the playground for a boy who should represent something quite the opposite. The high contrast between the subject and the environment makes this photograph impressive. Therefore, the environment is essential to Hardy's work. He used the environment to emphasize the characteristics of the subject he wanted to convey. In addition, a photograph of a young couple from the series made in the Elephant and Castle area also illustrates this point (Fig. 29).
31

Fig. 29: Bert Hardy, Couple in Love, Tenement Basement, Elephant and Castle, 1949, Gelatin silver print, 22.5 x 28 cm. Collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario, 2007/1003.

This photograph shows intimacy between a man and woman. The title states that they live in the basement, also clear through the view from their window. The decoration suggests that they live in poor conditions. Regardless of the environment of the place, the intimacy between the couple is evident. It shows a moment where the woman is staring at the man's face while leaning on his left shoulder. The sunlight shines through the window onto the cups, food on the plate, and faces of the couple. This creates a romantic atmosphere. This photograph is one of Hardy's three photographs selected for Edward Steichen's The Family of Man exhibition in 1955.59 This group of images suggests that Hardy did not only presented the facts of poverty at the time but showed Hardy's attitudes toward life as well. This reinforces what Sir Tom Hopkinson

59

See footnote #6, page 2 of this thesis for the name of the other two photographs selected for The Family of Man exhibition. 32

described about Hardy's photographs of the poor, "It was in his pictures of slum life and poverty, however, that Bert brought the whole of his nature and talent into focus. No one ever talked less than Bert Hardy about social conditions, in fact I doubt if he ever once used the words, yet few have done more to reveal them in a manner difficult to forget or overlook."60 It is the spirit of the poor who had been trying so hard to survive that Hardy captured in his photographs. Besides the photographs of the poor, Hardy chose to focus on people with various backgrounds. He used different points of view and shooting distances to show the identity and intimacy of subject. This aspect of his working method is something notable in his photographs. 3.2 Photographs of the Korean War In 1950, Bert Hardy and Picture Post writer James Cameron flew to South Korea to cover the story of the Korean War between North Korean and United Nations forces led by the United States.61 The collection of Bert Hardy photographs at the AGO contains 30 gelatin silver prints of the Korean War. They document various subjects including Korean civilians, North Korean prisoners, and the soldiers in the United Nations forces (Fig 30-32). There are six photographs of Korean civilians, three photographs of North Korean injured prisoners, and 20 photographs of war scenes from the side of the UN forces (Fig. 33).

35

Hardy photographed different aspects of the war. There are surrendering civilians walking down the street, an injured North Korean soldier being treated, and American soldiers resting in the battlefield and fighting during the war. These three aspects were shown from his work of the Korean War. He chose to use a wide shot to show the subjects and the environment surrounding them in order to show the extent of war. The ruins behind the civilians in figure 30 suggest the seriousness of the war, and the dug hole in figure 32 shows the poor conditions that the American marines were in.

Figure 34 documents a completely different moment than figure 33. Figure 33, shows the moment that the American Marines land in Inchon. A soldier is reaching for another soldier's arm during the landing. The darkness of the photograph and small depth of field create intense emotion. In figure 34, a captured North Korean soldier is holding iron bars in a window and
36

looking outside. The close shooting distance creates a kind of intimacy. The high contrast reinforces the facial expression of the prisoner while the faces in figure 34 cannot be recognized. Two photographs taken in the same war from different sides reveal completely different feelings. The common aspects of Hardy's style can be seen by comparing figure 34 to other images with different subjects. For example, Hardy could always immerse himself in the shoot. Hardy presented people from different cultures equally as can be seen by distance between him and his subjects. Hardy photographed Audrey Hepburn and the injured North Korean prisoner mentioned above in the same year (Figs. 22 and 34). Both were taken at a close distance with a medium focal length. For a single-figure photograph, Hardy often used moderate focal lengths to bring the figure in the picture closer to the readers, no matter who they were. The absence of environment again places the emphasis on the subject itself. Emotionally, it provides a kind of closeness between the audience and the figure in the story. The distance is less than ten feet in almost every photograph of the collection. It also suggests that Hardy's main focus was on the human subject itself. The subjects of the two pictures described above are totally different, but they both show the same focus and use of perspective. The Audrey Hepburn image was shot in the Kew Gardens, London while the North Korean prisoner was shot during wartime. However, they both convey the same theme, Hardy's concern and empathy for human beings. One focuses on the beautiful smile of a woman renowned for her elegance and beauty. The other shows a deep concern about the future of the

37

prisoner himself, instead of emphasizing his political identity and environment. One shows happiness and the other reveals the prisoner's concern for the future . Among the 30 photographs, there is a portrait of Bert Hardy and the writer James Cameron taken by Ralph Izzard, who was the foreign correspondent of the Daily Mail at the time.62 (Figs. 35 and 36) There is handwriting on the back of the photograph that reads "Bert Hardy and James Cameron, photo by Ralph Izzard," but a credit stamp of Bert Hardy is shown on the back of the photograph as well.

It may contain both handwriting that credited Ralph Izzard and a stamp that credited Bert Hardy because Izzard used Hardy's camera to take this picture. Izzard shot it, but the credit belonged to Izzard and Hardy. 3.3 People in Western Europe The photographs of people in Western Europe in the collection include 64 gelatin silver prints which cover the time period from 1948 to 1955. For this corpus, Hardy traveled to four different countries to make these images: twenty-five photographs were taken in France, fourteen photographs were taken in Spain, twenty-three were taken in Portugal, and two were taken in Ireland. Among the photographs taken in France, two represent villagers in Mont-près-Chambord (1948) and two show a black dancer named Bambi (1955). Besides these, most of the photographs of France were taken by Hardy for two picture stories: one story consists of six photographs of American boxer Sugar Ray Robinson in Paris (Fig. 37), and the other one includes fifteen photographs of ordinary people in cafés on a Sunday morning on the Champs-Élysées, Paris. Both stories were photographed in 1951.

Hardy implemented some new approaches and techniques in his photographs of people on the Champs-Élysées (Figs. 38 and 39). Hardy did not focus on people's faces in some images, but he chose instead to photograph close-ups of people's legs. For example, one shows a pet dog sitting next to its owner's legs in the sunlight. Part of the table and a glass is visible in its top left corner. This suggests the location is outside, at a café or restaurant. Another also focuses primarily on a woman and man's legs. The position of the legs in both pictures is similar, with one leg is crossed over on the other. It suggests the relaxed mood in which people usually cross their legs because they feel comfortable. In this way, these images represent the calm environment in the café in a Sunday morning. In the images from Spain, there are thirteen photographs of people in Barcelona taken in 1951 and a photograph of a British soldier watching a Spanish dancer in Gibraltar, Spain. Hardy not only photographed the city scene and policeman in the street, but also the poor in different generations. Just as he photographed children in the Gorbals, Hardy took pictures of the homeless children in the Barcelona streets (Figs. 40 and 41).

Finally, Hardy made eleven photographs of the peasant pilgrims to Fatima, Portugal in 1952 and the rice harvest in Portugal in 1955 (Figs. 42-45). As discussed before, various shooting distances can be seen in Hardy's photographs. Again, Hardy used the environment to emphasize the identity of the subject. He used the medium shot or close-up portrait to emphasize the characteristics of the subject itself. For example, Hardy lowered his viewpoint and took a medium-distance shot to focus on the moment when the woman closed her eyes and put her hand on her head (Fig. 42). The higher point of view allows the audience to see more of the entire scene, including the background. In this photograph, it shows countless pilgrims (Fig. 43). The environment also helps bring the visual attention to the subject in the foreground. In this way, the environment strengthens the viewer's understanding of the subject. Cardinal Tedeschini sitting in the wheelchair is who these people have gathered to see or meet. The Bert Hardy photographic collection at the AGO reveals a great deal about his style. First, it demonstrated that people were his principal subjects; almost all of the photographs focus on people. Only in the Korean War series do some of the photographs focus on the war scene in general instead of the individual people in the war. Second, Hardy often used high contrast in his photographs. Hardy used the high contrast in his prints to highlight the subject's facial features. For example, the shadow of wrinkles on a farmer's face strengthens his toughness (Fig. 45), or a bright face of a firefighter versus a dark background makes the viewer's attention focus on the firefighter himself (Fig. 13). Finally, Hardy utilized various shooting distances and points of view to achieve his purpose. A greater shooting distance captures both subject and background,
44

which allows Hardy to provide context for the subject. In this way, the audience can learn more about the subject, the subject's identity, or the specific situation depicted. Different points of view allow the audience to better understand the aspects of the subject that Hardy wanted to convey.

Bert Hardy's work at Picture Post

4.1 Post-War British Life Post-war British society urgently needed to be stabilized and there was a focus on people's livelihoods after the conflict. Historian Joan C. Brown writes how "the Beveridge Report in 1942 spoke of the need to conquer the five giant evils ­ want, disease, squalor, ignorance, and idleness ­ each an aspect of poverty and often mutually reinforcing. The years 1944 to 1948 saw a range of important legislation and the adoption of major policy goals intended to overcome these evils."63 There were five major policy goals: "a desire to endow people with rights, an emphasis on opportunities rather than coercion, social security, solidarity, and to offer dignity to the poor."64 This suggests the urgent need to find a solution for poverty. In addition to the traditional approach of creating jobs, the goal was to create confidence among people and bring them together65. It was important to stabilize the social atmosphere and recover from the war. The social status of Britons often serves as the subject of Bert Hardy's photographs. As part of an agenda of solidarity and bringing hope to the people of Britain, the subjects of his wartime and post-war photographs are mostly the working class and poor people. For example, the first story that Hardy photographed with Picture Post photographer Bert Lloyd, "The East End at War" focused on poor people's living conditions in the East End, the poorest part of London after the bombing by the Germans.66 Other stories include: "The Forgotten Gorbals," "Life in the

Elephant," "Slums under the Trees," "Millions Like Her," and "The Best, and the Worst, of British Cities: Cardiff."67 The stories Hardy photographed for Picture Post about the lower classes were taken after the war, from 1948 to 1954. According to Hardy, "there was a strong determination to carry on as if nothing had happened. After having taken so many `laid-on' pictures, I almost hesitated to photograph scenes like the girl in the clothing workshop still at work on her sewing machine, in case it didn't look `real' enough."68 Hardy chose to show a brighter and more positive side: the working-class working hard in factories, people fighting to survive, and poor children playing happily together. It is the spirit of post-war Britain that is reflected in his work as well as through the magazine. The story "Prince Philip Meets the Miners" directly reports on a visit of Prince Philip to the workers at the Mosley Common Colliery coal mine.69 It also shows the attention of the royal family to the working class and the solidarity of the British. 4.2 Picture Post and Its Editors Picture Post was a seminal British weekly magazine published from 1938 to 1957. It was founded by editor Stephan Lorant, who was an important figure in the history of British photojournalism. Lorant was a Jewish Hungarian magazine editor from Budapest. Because of his criticism of the Nazis during Adolf Hitler's rise to power, he was put in "protective custody" by

the Nazis for six and half months in 1933.70 After being released from Nazi custody, and with the help of the Hungarian government, Lorant joined an exodus of journalists, scientists, artists, and Jews from Nazi Germany and moved to London.71 Lorant's first job in London was to be picture editor at Odhams Press where he worked on the launch issues of Britain's first popular picture magazine, Weekly Illustrated.72 Lorant decided he was not appreciated at Odhams working under editor Maurice Cowan, and left determined to produce a picture magazine of his own. This was not Picture Post, but the pocket journal Lilliput which was launched in July 1937.73 In May of 1938, Lilliput was sold to Sir Edward Hulton, the British publishing magnate, who was inspired by the success of Lorant's "clever political juxtapositions" and later appointed Lorant to create a national weekly to add to Hulton's growing stable of titles.74 This time, the result was Picture Post. The first issue was released on October 1, 1938.75 A huge success, all the print run sold out. Less than a year after the first issue, Picture Post was able to run circulation figures of over 1,700,000 per issue in the summer of 1939.76 The readership of the magazine was over 80% of the population in Britain.77 The total number of the articles

commissioned for Picture Post was over 9,000 during its publication lifetime.78 Among these 9,000 articles, 2,000 were actually used in the magazine and the rest were filed away.79 Stefan Lorant was the magazine's first editor and Sir Tom Hopkinson, who was his assistant at the time, became the second editor of Picture Post when Lorant immigrated to America in 1940.80 According to Sir Tom Hopkinson's account, Picture Post dealt with "issues which most concerned the young and thoughtful people of its time. Such issues were dealt with far less adequately in the press of the forties and fifties than they would be today."81 Born during World War II, Picture Post campaigned strongly against fascism. At the time, the general public relied on print media, newspapers and magazines to inform them of world events. Picture Post soon became popular for millions of young men and women; it handled the subjects they talked and argued about among themselves.82 Magazines such as Picture Post were the hottest media at the time. Picture Post also provided a social history of Britain for the forties and fifties. "It is obviously not a complete social history nor anything like it. It is a vivid and compelling series of glimpses into a period of intense crisis in our country's life, followed by the five post-war years when Britain was recovering, taking stock, and trying to adapt itself to its new position in the world," stated Sir Tom Hopkinson.83 A social reality can be seen in the Picture Post issues.

Only staying at Picture Post for twenty months, Lorant made the new photographic magazine popular and famous. Lorant was in charge of "the picture side" and Hopkinson looked after the text and captions.84 It was Lorant who "decided on the stories, photographs, layouts and the space allocations."85 Under the editorial team of only five members with a secretary and two staff photographers, Lorant took the majority of the control. He believed that words were secondary to images. "Over half of the page count was dedicated to the weekly's photo essays...Picture Post utilized the photo essay format to report news events, both local and global, and used the photo essay format as its main vehicle of communication."86 As a former Hungarian refugee, Lorant conceived a strong view of anti-Fascism and had "a sort of genius with the art of visual exposition in a popular idiom," while Hopkinson "contributed a vigorous prose style, sharp observation, and a sensitive `feel' for the native qualities of English life." For example, Lorant had a unique way of editing images, which was to make a symmetrical format as illustrated in figure 46.

Fig. 46: "Prague Under German Rule," Picture Post, (April 29, 1939): 18-19.

A symmetrical format included putting images on each page and those two pages forming the whole concept of the story was another Lorant strategy seen in figure 46. The position of the picture and text mirrors that of the other page.88 Lorant's perspective on picture magazines emphasizes the use of photographs to convey messages and opinions instead of using words to make the point. After Lorant left Picture Post, Hopkinson implemented different ways of running the magazine. In an interview with Harold Evans, Hopkinson stated that he had neither the knowledge nor the technical ability to do all the things Lorant had done, so he did not choose the photographs and write the articles by himself.89 Hopkinson let photographers discuss ideas together and bring up their thoughts and proposals. He also fully respected them and would actually take their advice. "The team, under Hopkinson's guidance, offered, in print and picture,

88 89

Cooper, "Reading Magazines," 35. Ford and Fell eds, Makers of Photographic History, 5. 51

a staggering visual record of the impact of mass warfare and its aftermath on a civilian population."90 In the history of photojournalism, Picture Post is viewed as a one of the most important visual documents of the British people during and after the war. Hopkinson maintained the basic style and format of the magazine after Lorant's departure. He kept Lorant's symmetrical format and developed his own working style later on (Fig. 44). He reduced the magazine's length by half, but increased the number of images on a single page.91 This meant that although the page numbers in total decreased, the quantity of photographs on each page increased.

The symmetrical format was still used in the issue of 1949, but small details were changed in the story (Fig. 47). The images on top and two sides are symmetrical, but the words and small images in the center are symmetrical diagonally rather than horizontally. There are also more photographs on the two pages compared to Lorant's design. In 1950, the photographic story of the Korean war covered by Hardy and writer James Cameron did not leave Picture Post owner Sir Edward Hulton satisfied. The story specifically concentrated on the ill treatment of North Koreans by the South Koreans with the connivance of some of their American allies.92 However, at the time, any criticism of the western side could be regarded as anti-Western and would even be seen as "Communist propaganda."93 Hulton did not like the idea that Cameron's and Hardy's focus was on the ill-treatment of North Korean soldiers. The magazine's editor, Sir Tom Hopkinson, tried to convince Hulton, but he failed. The story was published in the end, but with a completely different meaning from the one that Hardy, Cameron, and Hopkinson wanted to express. Supporting Hardy and Cameron's story firmly, Hopkinson was forced to resign.94 His successor was Ted Castle, photojournalist and the former assistant of Hopkinson. At the time, Castle also wanted to leave the magazine because of the incident, but Hopkinson stopped him. Castle became the deputy editor of the magazine. He only stayed for 6 months and then left Picture Post in 1951.95 After that, the magazine went through several editors, but did not reach the glory of the previous ten years. Picture Post raised the price
92 93 94 95

Hopkinson, Picture Post 1938-1950, 12. Ibid. Ibid., 13. Ibid. 53

from £4 to £6 in 1951. However, "the annual report observes a very adverse effect upon circulation."96 The profit in the year of 1957 was only £11 383, comparing to £209,097 in 1949 before Hopkinson left. Hopkinson believed that Picture Post failed in the end not because of the challenge of television, but the "vacillation of the magazine," meaning that the way the board ran the magazine internally. Its interference was problematic and the content already did not appeal to the readers' reading habits at the time.97 The struggle to compete with the rise of television and rapid changes in editorial policy decisions at Picture Post caused low circulation after 1950. 4.3 The Use of Hardy's Photographs in the Magazine Bert Hardy joined in Picture Post one year after Lorant left for America. Sir Tom Hopkinson, who was the assistant to Lorant in the Weekly Illustrated and the second editor of Picture Post, worked closely with Hardy from 1941 to 1950, when Lorant resigned from the magazine. While format and style was changed with Lorant's departure, Hopkinson still was influenced by him ­ Lorant had set the tone since the birth of Picture Post. Not all the photographs in the AGO collection had been selected for the magazine and some images that were published in the magazine are not a part of the AGO collection. However, as described above, many of the photographs in the collection were published in Picture Post. These photographs were edited before they were published. For example, all of the photographs were cropped. Moreover, the caption of each photograph was rewritten to develop a story that

96 97

Hopkinson, Picture Post 1938-1950, 13. Ibid., 14. 54

the editor wanted to show the readers via photographs. For example, the photographs below were used for the story "Fish"98 (Fig. 48) and the cover (Fig. 20) of Picture Post.

Left - Fig. 48: Cover, Picture Post, no.5 (February 3,1951). Right - Fig. 20: Bert Hardy, Four Female Fishworkers in Aprons and Scarves Talking with Smoking Plant in Background, 1951, Gelatin silver print, 25 x 19.5 cm. Collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario, 2007/1091.

As can be seen, the original photograph was cropped for use on the cover. The fisherwomen are larger in the cover cropping and they can be seen much more clearly as the main subject without excess elements in the background. The extent of the cropping also depended on the position of the Picture Post logo. By going through all issues of the magazine in the same year, one can see that the logo of Picture Post was always put on the top left corner. Therefore, the photograph was cropped and enlarged so that the logo would not cover the subjects' face. The extent of the enlarging and cropping also left enough space at the bottom for captions and other

98

information about the magazine such as issue number, published date, price, and pages within the magazine. In the story, "The Forgotten Gorbals," two photographs formed a whole story.99 The editor flipped and cropped one of the originals (Fig. 49 and 51) and cropped the other (Fig.50 and 52), then printed them half size on each page, connecting the two pages as a visual unit and creating symmetry through the design.

Left- Fig. 49: "The Forgotten Gorbals," Picture Post, (January 31, 1948): 12. Right Fig. 50: "The Forgotten Gorbals," Picture Post, (January 31, 1948): 13.

Collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario, 2007/986.

The captions of each photograph were not related. The man in the bed was captioned "John an Ex-Serviceman lies in Bed Under His Army Greatcoat in a Decrepit Gorbals Tenement (Fig.51)." The image showing a girl at a table was captioned "Mary a 16-Year-Old Bakery Worker Sits Philosophically at Dining Table in Gorbals Tenement Front (Fig. 52)." The photographs as reproduced on the left page in the magazine was captioned, "In a Gorbals Back-room a Man Hangs on to His Dreams for as Long as He can (Fig. 49)." Under the caption, the sub-caption reads, "Out in the street is a fading chalk scrawl: `Welcome Home, John.' And here lies John, under his army greatcoat. It is 11 a.m. The rest of the family are long gone ­ his brothers to school, his 16-year-old sister to work. In a thousand rooms, no bigger than this, some Gorbals

57

folk sleep four to a bed (Fig. 49)." The right-hand image in the magazine was captioned "In a Gorbals Front Room, a Girl Finds Her Dreams Are Slipping Out of Her Grasp (Fig. 50)." The sub-caption reads, "Mary is sixteen. She works in a bakery. She has the fancies and foibles natural to a girl of her age. She dreams of nice clothes, handsome suitors, happy times. But already her life is colored by her surroundings. Already futility and frustration stretch ahead. Already her dreams are losing their battle against reality (Fig. 50)." By re-writing the captions in the magazine, coherence is created between the two photographs. The captions for the published photographs in the magazine gives a changed context for the photographs and further creates a relationship between the two subjects in the photographs that was not their originally. According to the story written under the two photographs, the two figures in the picture were related, but the events happening in the photographs did not take place at the same time and in the same space. The way that the editor flipped the photograph on the left created the illusion of a single space. It looks like the girl is troubled and worried about the man lying in the bed. In this way, the images invite the readers to wonder about the relationship between the people shown. As a result, the figures seem closer and more relatable to readers, allowing them to experience more sympathy for the difficulties the two figures have encountered. This is also what the editors wanted to accomplish ­ to resonate with readers' feelings elicited by the pictures. By flipping the photograph on the left, the direction of the man in the photograph turns to right from left. By cropping, flipping, and adjusting the composition, editors caused readers to draw conclusions
58

about the relationships between the figures. The editor's job was to develop a consistent story from the photographer's original pictures and captions. The same issue of "The Forgotten Gorbals," includes the photograph of the boy playing leapfrog in the cemetery mentioned above (Fig.53).

Fig. 53: "The Forgotten Gorbals," Picture Post, (January 31, 1948): 15.

The caption reads, "Favorite Playground for the Young is the Corporation Burial Ground in Rutherglen Road." The sub-caption reads, "Some see them as hooligans and vandals... Some see them as ordinary children, hungry for a decent place to play. The youngsters do not know whether the dead care. But they know that here is grass to play on, trees to climb. They know the cemetery is the only bit of green in the Gorbals." By reading the caption of the photograph, it is not difficult to comprehend the editor's purpose, which is to emphasize the actions of children, who play in a strange place that children do not usually play around, a cemetery, because they have nowhere else to play.

The original photograph in the collection however only captured a moment of a boy playing leapfrog on a tombstone. A single boy's actions cannot represent all of the children in the Gorbals. By combining several photographs of other children also playing at the cemetery, a more sympathetic image was created.

Comparing the two details of these two photographs, it also can be seen that a boy was added in the photograph shown in the magazine. In the original photograph, there were only abandoned tombstones to the left of the boy jumping on the tombstone, but a boy and a bright tombstone were added in the magazine (Fig. 54). Two aspects of the photographic editing were implemented. First, the captions of the photographs in the magazine have more context than the captions for the original photographs. More specific and coherent story lines further developed the expressive content of the photographs. By adding a detailed caption and sub-caption, the editors could emphasize details that readers could easily overlook from the photograph alone. Second, montage was sometimes needed for better visual illustrations. Its purpose was to support the point that the editor wants to make and help him to better emphasize the content that the photograph might otherwise not show to readers directly. The examples discussed above show how editors develop ideas and stories from original photographs. At this point, both editors and photographers had the same goal of creating a complete story using the photographs. However, sometimes the editors' ideas opposed those of the photographers. The owner, Edward Hulton did not want to show the public what Hardy and Hopkinson wanted to show about the ill-treated prisoners in the Korean War. As a result of this political interference, the meaning of the photographs was changed.

61

Collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario, 2007/1048. Right- Fig.55: "We Follow the Road to Hell," Picture Post, (September 16, 1950): 19.

The caption of the original photograph is "A Captured North Korean Soldier Wounded in the Arm is Fitted a Sling by a Medic while a Military Policeman Looks on," while the captions in the magazine is "A Man Who Had Expected His Captors to Shoot Him (Figs. 31 and 55)." The sub-caption reads, "He still can't get used to the idea that, instead of shooting him, they dressed his wounds. But there have been not a few cases, also, of brutal treatment and shooting of prisoners by both sides (Fig. 55)." The caption of the photograph only describes the content of the picture and the identity of the subjects. The soldier is a captured North Korean soldier and a medic is treating him. In the magazine, the caption emphasizes on the treatment of the captured North Korean soldier. Both caption and sub-caption refer to his belief that he would be shot after being captured and his
62

surprise at not only not being killed, but being treated instead. This cannot be communicated only through the image, it was the captions added in the magazine that gave the context to the reader. According to Hardy, he intended to show the ill-treated prisoners to the world with his photographs, but the magazine presented an entirely different angle by saying that prisoners were not ill-treated, and at least they were not killed by their captors, which was neither the truth nor what Hardy and Cameron wanted to convey.

Another image showing an injured man walking down a street demonstrates how editing and captioning changed the story presented by Picture Post (Figs. 56 and 57). The caption of the original photograph reads, "Old Man with Burned Hands and His Family Run from Along Street after Emerging from Strafed Town, Inchon." The caption and sub-caption written in the magazine reads: "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO HUMANITY WHEN IT IS LIBERATED
63

TWICE WITHIN THREE MONTHS" in capital letters. "When humanity gets given `the works,' in mid-twentieth century style, it passes beyond tragedy. Its old ones caper around like crazy young ones put out more crazy flags in a confused desire to please, its crazy infants surrender in advance, and its spokesmen utter their final crazy verdict: "sank you!" Which, being interpreted, means that humanity, with the best will in the world, can stand no more liberations like this." The old man and little girl might have surrendered to the "humanist force" of the South, but the sub-caption and caption exaggerated and emphasized the positive side of the South and the willingness of people to be liberated by the UN forces. Although the caption of the original photograph only described the scene, the captions from the magazine took sides and promoted a specific perspective. The conflict between the magazine's photographer, editor, and owner, the purpose of the biased captions is clear. A different narrative would give the photograph a whole new meaning and context. In conclusion, the photographs of Bert Hardy were edited for reproduction in the magazine to develop a story with the photographs and descriptive captions. At this point, the relationship between editors and photographers was complex. On the one hand, editing could develop a better story for the audience. On the other hand, it could also twist the photographer's intentions. The examples of Hardy's photographs and the use of them in Picture Post by the editors shows that editors can either support or disregard photographer's intentions through editing. A photographer's power is, in many ways, less than that of editors. Through photographic editing and captioning, editors can be seen as the second creators of photojournalists' photographs.
64

5. Conclusion Using the collection of his images at the AGO, this thesis addresses how Bert Hardy's photographs contributed to the British visual culture. Hardy's focus was on people. Landscape-only photographs can hardly be found in the collection. He used his camera to capture people of different class, ethnicity, gender, and age. One could see not only the Queen's royal wedding, but also the poor in the Gorbals, homeless people in Barcelona, farmers harvesting rice in Portugal, famous boxer Sugar Ray Robinson traveling in Paris, Audrey Hepburn smiling in an English park, people at a café on a Sunday morning on the Champs-Élysées, and intense battles in Korea, all through Hardy's eyes. In all of the environments and situations Hardy photographed, his purpose was to emphasize identity and enrich the reader's sense of the personality of the subject. He chose various points of view and shooting distances, and utilized high contrast to emphasize the characteristics of the people through his camera work and printing technique. In this way, he made the people in his photographs look vivid and interesting. His photographs in Picture Post were edited. Through cropping, flipping, and the use of montage, the compositions of his photographs were adjusted to serve the purpose of the magazine. By adding and editing the captions, the meaning of his photographs appeared to be more comprehensive. Readers were provided with more context from the captions of photographs in the magazine. Editors even directed this comprehension through the captions they wrote.

Picture Post is a visual documentation of the British people during and after World War II. This kind of visual documentation was different from other media of the time. Not only had significant historical moments been documented, but also the everyday life of the people. Bert Hardy's photographs are fine examples of this kind of visual record. Glenn Jordan states, "Picture Post photography was governed by a desire to get close, to discover, to understand and reveal the rich tapestry of everyday life."100 In addition to the anti-fascist value of the magazine, its central concern was humanism, both during and after the war. The contents of the photographs it published proved this point. As Jean-Claude Gautrand, the Parisian journalist and photographer stated, "This `humanist' photography, which reached its peak in the 1950s, would follow various paths, sometimes parallel but always maintaining, whoever the people concerned or whatever their behavior, obvious characteristics in common: a certain generosity, optimism, sensitivity to the simple joys of life, an empathy for people in the street caught in action, and for the symbolism of scenes which suggest a common sense of the wonderful."101 The photographs of Bert Hardy prove that this humanism was embedded in the magazine. In Sir Tom Hopkinson's words, "he took the pictures he did because he had made himself a fine photographer; but he got the chance to take such pictures because of the kind of human being he was."102 The subjects of the photographs and the stories in the magazine were the poor, little people, and the way they lived their lives after the war. However, it did not stop there. It was the

positive attitudes of these people despite everything that were shown in the stories, and this was what the magazine and its photographers wanted to convey. The photographs of Picture Post "make concessions to the goals of realism."103 This means that the photographs were not coded with any excess meaning, Sociologist Stuart Hall states that "what impresses us, at the first glance, about these photographs is their ability to bring the world of real events massively to our attention, apparently without the intervention of a code."104 The reality is simply shown in the photograph, "The pictures insist on their content ­ on the `what' of the events and subjects they document: there is some rhetorical correspondence between image and event."105 Picture Post can be seen as a bridge that connected the photojournalist to the added depth of the editor and his caption. The caption played an important role in developing the exact meaning that Picture Post wanted to convey with Hardy's images - either their anti-Fascist stance or their support for humanism during and after the war. Bert Hardy's photographs conveyed Picture Post's ideals. Through editing, cropping, and flipping his photographs, through montage, and the manipulation of captions, a story could be created and more clearly communicated. This narrative of a united Britain, and in fact a united humanity after a horrific war is the legacy of Hardy's images and his associated with Picture Post.
