ABSTRACT The Use of Indicators in Sustainability Reports Produced by Corporations Operating in the Canadian Oil Sands Industry Jennifer Adelina Dell'Aquila Master of Applied Science, 2016 Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University This thesis aims to explore and understand the use of indicators in sustainability reports produced by 13 corporations operating in the Canadian oil sands industry. The literature review demonstrated that little work has been done to understand the use of indicators and reporting within this industry. Three research questions are addressed through a content analysis of sustainability reports. The analysis shows that when looking at indicators based on the common themes or sustainability pillar they address, there appears to be consistency across the industry. However, when looking at indicators individually, there is a great deal of inconsistency making comparison of reports and benchmarking incredibly difficult. This research has a number of practical implications, particularly, it is the first comprehensive review of indicators being disclosed in the industry and can be used by a variety of stakeholders. Further, this research sets the foundation for a number of other possible streams of future research.

Introduction

1.1 Overview As conventional sources of crude oil diminish, the Canadian oil sands, mainly located in Alberta, have become an essential component to the ongoing challenge of providing viable sources of fuel for the ever growing needs of society not only in Canada, but globally. The Canadian oil sands are proven to be one of the largest oil reserves in the world, trailing only Saudi Arabia and Venezuela (Government of Alberta, 2016). However, the extraction of bitumen found in oil sands to produce synthetic crude oil is not without consequence. The process is carbon intense and can result in a negative impact on the environment. Given this impact, strict monitoring to not only ensure compliance with regulations to preserve the environment, but also to ensure corporations extracting these materials are doing so in an ethical and responsible way is essential. A key component to achieving this is the identification and use of sustainability indicators that will provide reliable, relevant and consistent information across the industry. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the use of sustainability indicators in sustainability reporting in Canada's oil sands industry. This will lead to an improved understanding of the consistency and comparability of reports being produced by key oil sands corporations. The literature review considered existing research in the areas of sustainability, sustainability reporting and the use of sustainability indicators. The literature review shows that, while there is relevant research in each of these areas, there is very little information on the use of sustainability indicators and the state of sustainability reporting at the industry level; specifically on the Canadian oil sands. This study is intended to document the relevant oil sands sustainability indicators and understand the consistency and comparability of sustainability reports across the industry. Further, the research aimed to understand if and how the industry has evolved

1

with reporting over a 4 year period. A content analysis was completed on reports produced by 13 key oil sands corporations in two time periods; 2010 and 2014. The results of this content analysis are a database of indicators used for each time period along with a comprehensive look at the consistency across corporations and the evolution over time. This provided the basis for an in-depth analysis and a set of recommendations for going forward.

1.2 Problem Statement In the 1980's, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly recognized that there was a serious issue with the damage being done to the environment and the depletion of our natural resources around the world (WCED, 1987). In response, the General Assembly established the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) (WCED, 1987). Long term preservation of the environment and the responsibility of all nations to ensure they are united in the goal of this preservation was the goal of the commission (WCED, 1987). Gro Harlem Brundtland, was tasked with leading this project and appointed as Chairman of the Commission (WCED, 1987). In October of 1987, the report "Our Common Future" was released (WCED, 1987). This document is credited with popularizing the phrase "sustainable development". The phase was defined as "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (WCED, 1987). Since the widespread acceptance of this definition, the concept of sustainable development has been further defined to include social, environmental and economic aspects. Since 1987, this term has gained momentum and is now used in industry, education, government and society. The concept of sustainable development is now one that is seen as the responsibility of all of industry and its players. Specifically, corporations have faced ongoing pressure from society to incorporate this idea of development into the core of their business operations. Success of corporations, and other entities, in meeting this overarching goal of sustainable development requires measurement. Key performance indicators identified
2

as sustainability indicators can be used to achieve this critical component. For the purpose of this research a sustainability indicator is defined as "indicators that measure progress made in sustainable growth and development" (UN, 1997). An indicator is defined as "a sign that shows the condition or existence of something" (MerriamWebster Dictionary, 2016) or "a device that shows a measurement" (Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 2016).Without measurement, there is no way to determine progress towards sustainable development and sustainability as a whole. Sustainability indicators are designed to establish baselines and measure progress and success in mitigating and rectifying the identified social, economic and environmental issues. Corporations have recognized the need for measurement and sustainability reporting, which encompasses both quantitative and qualitative, is becoming more widespread. Some tools are available to corporations to help guide the creation of these reports. For example, The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) released its most recent set of sustainability indicators, the G4 guidelines, in 2013 with additional sector level supplements. Other reporting initiatives include Environment Canada's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Program (GHGRP) and the Public Accountability Statements Regulations for banks, Insurance companies and Trust and Loan companies in Canada. However, despite programs and tools like these, corporate sustainability reporting continues to be largely a voluntary initiative. Thus, the type and quality of information amongst reports even in the same industry is largely inconsistent making comparison and practical use by stakeholders and society as a whole extremely difficult. Some work has been done to explore the use of indicators at a corporate level (Roca and Searcy, 2012) and the comparability of reports produced using the GRI guidelines in the mining sector (Boiral and Henri, 2015). However, little work is available on understanding the actual indicators being reported on, and the information being provided by the oil and gas sector. Further, little work has been done to understand the consistency of information being provided, specifically by different corporations in a given industry, and particularly over time.

1.3 Purpose and Research Objectives The purpose of this thesis will be to explore the use of indicators and the consistency of sustainability reporting across corporations operating in Canada's oil sands industry. Three key objectives support this purpose: 1. To explore what indicators Canada's oil sands industry is currently reporting on. 2. To analyze the consistency and comparability of sustainability reports across Canada's oil sands industry. 3. To determine how indicator disclosures, consistency, and comparability in the Canadian oil sands have evolved and changed over time

1.4 Scope This thesis was based on sustainability reports produced by 13 corporations operating in Canada's oil sands industry for the 2010 and 2014 reporting periods. For the purpose of this study a sustainability report was defined using the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD) definition from the report "Sustainable Development Reporting: Striking the Balance" which reads "We define sustainable development reports as public reports by companies to provide internal and external stakeholders with a picture of corporate position and activities on economic, environmental and social dimensions. In short, such reports attempt to describe the company's contribution toward sustainable development." (WBCSD, 2002). The research specifically focused on printable pdf formatted reports produced by each of these corporations. Reports included were any form of a sustainability, corporate social responsibility or equivalent report. If available, specific oil sands sustainability reports were used since the research was intended specifically to look at information availability for this industry.

1.5 Thesis Organization This thesis is organized into 5 remaining chapters. Chapter 2 contains a literature review exploring the evolution of sustainability and sustainable development. It takes a deeper look into corporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility and how
4

these have developed into what we see in modern day society. The literature review briefly explores the definition and roots of each of these themes. It then goes onto discuss sustainability reporting and the use of indicators for this type of reporting. Finally, the literature review touches on relevant literature pertaining specifically to reporting in the oil and gas industry, of which there is relatively little to date. Chapter 3 outlines the research questions and main objectives for this thesis. This chapter also details the methods used to complete the research. Chapter 4 reviews the results and provides an analysis of the information studied. This includes complete indicator databases for the Alberta oil sands industry for both the 2010 and 2014 reporting periods. The analysis looks at the emergence of themes among indicators across the industry for both periods and how this has changed over time. Finally, the analysis looks at the breakdown of indicators across the three pillars of the triple bottom for both time periods. Lastly, chapter 6 concludes the thesis with both a discussion and summary of the findings, along with contributions, limitations and recommendations for further research and a final conclusion.

Literature Review

2.1 Introduction The purpose of this literature review will be to explore and understand the use of sustainability indicators by corporations and, in turn, the use and purpose of sustainability reporting. The literature review will set the stage for a deeper analysis into the use of sustainability reporting and indicators across companies operating in Alberta's oil sands. The first section of the review will look at sustainability and how this is applied generally at the corporate level as it relates to corporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility. The second section of this review looks at motivations for reporting by corporations. This is followed by a section looking at how the concept of sustainable development applies in the extractive sector. The next two sections review sustainability reporting and the GRI along with the use of indicators and the role they play. Finally, there is a review of current literature on work completed looking at the oil and gas industry, followed by conclusions and motivations for research.

2.2 Sustainable Development As previously mentioned, the most widely recognized and accepted definition for sustainable development was released in the 1987 report "Our Common Future". This report defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (WCED, 1987). In the years following the release of this report, the idea of sustainable development was broadened to not only include the environmental aspect of development, but also the social and economic pieces of the puzzle (Steurer et al., 2005). The definition was again expanded to not only consider society on a macro level, but also at a micro level through the inclusion of the concept of "corporate sustainability" (Steurer et al., 2005). The idea of sustainable development is in essence a meeting ground and starting point for environmental and development groups (Dresner, 2002). Dresner (2002) outlines that the idea was intended to be a softer approach to relaying the environmental message which had typically been a much harsher doom and gloom approach. The hope was that the idea of sustainable development would help to ensure that environmental concerns would be incorporated into government policy (Dresner, 2002). Despite the acceptance of this definition it is important to note that there has been debate and controversy surrounding the idea of sustainable development. Dresner (2002) criticizes the definition for being vague and meaningless. Dresner (2002) outlines that this vagueness stems from uncertainty around what the term "development" really means. The 1987 report "Our Common Future" states that "If large parts of the developing world are to avert economic, social, and environmental catastrophes, it is essential that global economic growth be revitalized" (WCED, 1987). In other words, a strong economy is imperative to ensuring a healthy environment (Steurer et al., 2005). However, Daly in his 1996 book "Beyond Growth: The Economics of Sustainable Development" argues that growth, both population and production, must remain within the carrying capacity of the environment (Daly, 1996). Despite the criticisms, sustainable development seeks to achieve a balance between three distinct areas; economic, environmental and social performance (Elkington, 1998).

2.2.1 Corporate Sustainability Business and corporations play an integral role in sustaining economic and social development. However, corporations of all types are being faced with responsibilities and challenges that extend beyond financial commitments to their shareholders. Corporations are no longer looking at "if" they need to consider both the environmental and social impacts on the communities they operate in, instead they are faced with looking at "how" (Epstein, 2008). Freeman suggests that as the business environment has evolved, corporations are now accountable not only to their shareholders, customers and suppliers, but also to a broader group of stakeholders including, environmentalists, employees and local community organizations (Freeman, 1984). Today, there are many different definitions of corporate sustainability (Roca and Searcy, 2012). For example, the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) has defined it as "adopting business strategies and activities that meet the needs of the enterprise and its stakeholders today while protecting, sustaining and enhancing the human and natural resources that will be needed in the future" (IISD, 1992). Another definition is "company activities ­ voluntary by definition - demonstrating the inclusion of social and environmental concerns in business operations and in interactions with stakeholders" (Marrewijk, 2003). Despite the fact that there is no "one" definition, each of the examples share a similar theme. The key is that business operations must meet not only today's needs, but future needs as well. This extends beyond the economic and financial aspect of business operations and the impacts to its shareholders to include the environmental and social impacts to stakeholders as a broader group. Collectively the three areas of economic, environmental and social performance are often referred to as the three pillars of the "triple bottom line" (Elkington, 1998).

2.2.2 Corporate Social Responsibility Corporate social responsibility is closely associated with corporate sustainability. They have, however, been described as a "contradictions in terms" (Moon, 2007). Moon (2007) suggests two reasons for this, one being that a corporation by nature is not capable of enacting social responsibility, the second being that economic development and sustainability of the planet and of its resources cannot coexist (Moon, 2007). Further to this, there has been debate as to whether the ideas of corporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility are one and the same or, in fact, separate ideas (Moon, 2007). While some suggest that the two terms are separate ideas, others have considered them to be synonymous with each other (Marrewijk, 2003). In his work Marrewijk (2003), suggests keeping the two ideas separate. He describes Corporate Social Responsibility as looking at the union of people and the organization, including transparency and dialogue with stakeholders (Marrewijk, 2003). In other words, Corporate Social Responsibility is more about how transparent a corporation is with their stakeholders as well as how they interact with these stakeholders. Alternatively, Corporate Sustainability is more agency focused while providing more consideration to "value creation, environmental management, environmental friendly production systems, human capital management systems and so forth" (Marrewijk, 2003). Corporate Social Responsibility, like Corporate Sustainability, does not have one widely accepted definition. One definition presented by Commission of the European Communities in their paper "Promoting a European Framework for Corporate Social Responsibility" is that Corporate Social Responsibility is "a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis" (Commission of the European Communities, 2001). The Commission went on in their 2002 paper titled "Corporate Social Responsibility: A Business Contribution to Sustainable Development" to elaborate on the original definition. This addition considered that, while there are a number of approaches to Corporate Social Responsibility by corporations, there is agreement on the following key points (Commission of the European Communities, 2002). First, Corporate Social Responsibility is a behaviour extending beyond legal
8

requirements and taken on a voluntary basis as it is deemed a long term interest (Commission of the European Communities, 2002). Second, there is a definite link to Corporate Sustainability and third, that environmental, social and economic impacts must all be considered during operation (Commission of the European Communities, 2002). This is not something additional that a company takes on, but rather it is integrated into the way the corporation is run (Commission of the European Communities, 2002). The WBCSD is another organization that offers a definition for corporate social responsibility. In their 1999 report "Corporate Social Responsibility: Meeting Changing Expectations" they outline the definition as "the continuing commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as of the local community and society at large" (WBCSD, 1999). While the definitions vary slightly in their focus, what is consistent is that both definitions recognize the need for Corporate Social Responsibility to be rooted into the underlying strategy of a corporation versus being an add-on to. It must be an ongoing and living part of the corporation's planning and operational activities. Dahlsrud (2008) presents an analysis of 37 definitions of Corporate Social Responsibility. Dahlsrud (2008) concludes that while there are a number of definitions pertaining to Corporate Social Responsibility they all centre around 5 dimensions (1) The Stakeholder dimension, (2) The Social dimension, (3) The Economic dimension, (4) The Voluntariness dimension, and (5) The Environmental dimension.

2.3 Motivations for Corporate Sustainability "The Social Responsibility of business is to increase its profits" is the title and main argument presented by Milton Friedman in a 1970 article published in the New York Times Magazine. Friedman suggests that any executive in a corporation is an employee of the business owners whose main interest is usually to make as much money as they possibly can while following legal and social norms (Friedman, 1970). In the 45 years since this article was published, there has been a major shift in thinking surrounding the topic of corporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Moon (2007) discusses the reason for this shift in thinking and attributes it to the changes and
9

evolution of four main drivers in the business world. The first, market drivers, includes consumer demands, employee preferences, investors and business suppliers. The second, social drivers, consider consumers, employees and investors. Moon (2007) expands on this driver to also include pressures from non-governmental organizations, media, social expectations or norms and finally, different business associations. The third driver, government, can be a driver via endorsements by political figures or "soft regulations", which in turn drive a shift to sustainable business (Moon, 2007). Finally, globalization is a major driver in that it has completely changed the way information is shared. Modern technology has taken away any barriers that previously prevented information sharing. This ability for stronger interaction across the country and the world has led to a need for businesses to consider their impacts far more today than in the past (Moon, 2007). Vogel (2005) outlines that there are other reasons for a corporation to take on sustainability initiatives. For example, higher employee morale, or the idea that selfregulation may reduce the chances of government regulations coming into play (Vogel, 2005). Further, Vogel (2005) outlines that a corporation acting in a more responsible manner is likely related to the corporation recognizing this as a method of achieving a competitive advantage. But even today, with all the changes that have affected the business world, profitability is still identified as the most influential reasons why a corporation takes on sustainability initiatives (Vogel, 2005). These, and other, motivations for corporate sustainability are widely discussed in the literature. For example, Adams (2002) cites the most common motivations for reporting to be enhancing the corporation's image while also improving their credibility with stakeholders. Bebbington et al. (2009) describe motivations to be linked to a corporation's strategy for achieving differentiation, while Deegan (2007) explores the idea that reporting is undertaken to enhance a corporation's legitimacy with society. In addition to the above there are several theories which examine and shed light on the root issues that may drive a corporation to take on sustainability initiatives. These

10

organizational theories include stakeholder theory, resource dependency theory and institutional theory.

2.3.1 Stakeholder Theory By definition a stakeholder is "any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives" (Freeman, 1984). Stakeholder theory argues that a corporation which considers and acts in the interest of all its stakeholders will perform better than a corporation that ignores certain stakeholder groups (Hatch and Cunliffe, 2013). Roca and Searcy (2012) highlight the link between stakeholder theory and its influence on corporate sustainability. Hatch and Cunliffe (2013) further argue that "one important implication of stakeholder theory is that ethics obligates organizations to consider their impact on the wider social and physical environments from which they take their resources" (Hatch and Cunliffe, 2013). Application of this theory to the oil and gas industry would imply that the corporations that are most likely to be successful in achieving their corporate goals take the needs of their stakeholders into account in their operations. Sustainability reporting is one way for corporations to demonstrate how they have both considered and responded to the needs of each of their stakeholders; both internal and external. 2.3.2 Resource Dependency Theory Resource dependency theory is founded on the basis that all organizations require resources and that organizations rely on their environments for these resources (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). These required resources may be controlled by other organizations (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). Therefore, the survival and success of an organization is dependent upon its ability to obtain the resources they need while still managing the environment and its restriction (Pfeffer and Salancik 1978). Hatch and Cunliffe (2013) explain that dependence on resources is how the environment shows power over an organization and influences things like "competitive prices, desirable products and services, and efficient organizational structures and processes" (Hatch and Cunliffe, 2013). Within the oil and gas sector the environment asserts power over organization through the availability of a resource which, in the case of oil and gas is finite.
11

2.3.3 Institutional Theory The underlying idea behind institutional theory is that along with materials, labour and knowledge that organizations need to operate; their success is also dependent on the acceptance of the societies where they operate (Hatch and Cunliffe, 2013). DiMaggio and Powell explain that "organizations compete not just for resources and customers, but for political power and institutional legitimacy, for social as well as economic fitness" (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). DiMaggio and Powell (1983) go onto to outline three mechanisms which can trigger institutional isomorphic change as being (1) coercive ­ which responds to political pressures or legitimacy problems, (2) mimetic ­ which stems from response to uncertainty which can lead to imitation, and (3) normative ­ which stems from professionalism and workers with similar backgrounds obtaining a certain response (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). Hatch and Cunliffe (2013) further elaborate on this theory by summarizing the demands into two categories. The first being demands which are "technical, economic and physical" (Hatch and Cunliffe, 2013) in nature requiring organizations to produce goods and services which they can in turn trade on the market (Hatch and Cunliffe, 2013). The second set of demands are political, social and cultural demands as well as legal demands which need to be meet in order for the corporation to achieve the legitimacy they need to operate successfully (Hatch and Cunliffe, 2013). Institutional theory applies to sustainability reporting in the oil and gas industry. Sustainability reporting in and of itself is not regulated, nor is it a mandatory act. However, as we will go onto see, organizations take this reporting on as it allows them a mechanism with which they are able to showcase their integrated social, economic and environmental performance, which addresses the broader concerns of the societies in which they operate.

2.4 Sustainable Development in the Extractive Sector Cowell et al. (1999) outlines that one of the major issues surrounding the idea of sustainability is how this fits into and is managed by the primary extraction sector.
12

Reasons outlined for this include these resources being finite in nature and the potential access (or lack of access) to current and future generations, environmental impacts of both using and extracting these resources, the economic benefits, and the social impacts which can be either positive or negative (Cowell et al., 1999). This idea of unsustainability of finite resources can be dated back to Thomas Malthus in his 1798 paper "An Essay on the Principals of Population" in which he wrote: "Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio. A slight acquaintance with numbers will shew the immensity of the first power in comparison of the second" (Malthus, 1978).In other words, Malthus was arguing that if population continues to grow without limits humans will eventually deplete finite resources. Another classic study of this topic includes the popular study "Limits to Growth", conducted by an interdisciplinary team of professionals who looked at five areas (population, agricultural production, natural resources, industrial production and pollution) which can limit growth (Meadows et al., 1972). The study models different scenarios for growth to show the importance of finding an equilibrium state in which all factors are balanced (Meadows et al., 1972). When looking to understand how the idea of "sustainability" or "sustainable development" fits into the extractive sector, Tilton (1996) more recently introduced two main paradigms. The first is the "The Fixed Stock Paradigm", in which Tilton outlines that scientists, ecologists and engineers are concerned with the finite nature of these resources and suggests that current and rising demands cannot be supported (Tilton, 1996). The second is the "Opportunity Cost Paradigm", in which economists argue that as cost of these resources go up due to depletion; other efforts will be undertaken in the way of new technology, market incentives, public policies or substitutions of resources (Tilton, 1996). As such, as resource availability changes so too will the operations of these corporations, potentially to the point of developing different resources to meet needs. A 2005 report sponsored by the World Bank outlines some of the significant contributions that can be made by the extractive sector to the economic development of
13

a country particularly through allowing for foreign investment opportunities, development of the private sector, generating government revenues, foreign exchange earnings and employment opportunities (Liebenthal et al., 2005). However, despite these economic benefits, the growth of the extractive sector in many countries has been linked with social and environmental issues. For example, Auty (2004) outlines that resource abundant countries generally fall into a staples trap as policy in these country does not promote diversification; this in turn can lead to a long and challenging recovery period when the resource is no longer sustaining the economy (Auty, 2004). Given that oil is a non-renewable resource and, that non-renewable resources are finite, it is arguable that there is no way to sustainably develop this resource as it will eventually be depleted as outlined in the "The Fixed Cost Paradigm" described by Tilton. Although the end result may seem dismal regardless of all efforts, this argument is not without another perspective and coming to that conclusion leaves out some very important pieces of the puzzle. The positive social and economic benefits that arise because of access to oil as a resource should be considered. For example, in Canada specifically the oil and gas industry plays a major role in funding health, pension and education programs through the taxes and royalties being paid to both provincial and federal governments (House of Commons Canada, 2014). Furthermore, recall that as we advance technologically we often find new sources of energy, new exploration and extraction process, which can often be more efficient and, substitution of resources (Nooten, 2007; Tilton, 1996). For example, in the United States between 2000 and 2010 oil and gas companies invested around $9 billion in renewable energy technologies (Switzer et al., 2013). This amounted to almost 20% of total investments in renewable energy for that time period (Switzer et al., 2013). Specifically when looking at Canada's oil sands industry this trend can already be seen with the creation of industry associations like the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) who are "focused on accelerating the pace of improvement in environmental performance in Canada's oil sands through collaborative action and innovation" (COSIA, 2016a). To date COSIA cites their member companies as having already
14

shared 814 different innovations and technologies which cost around $1.3 billion to develop (COSIA, 2016a). COSIA has outlined 4 main focus areas being land, tailings, greenhouse gases and water (COSIA, 2016b). With the potential for improved efficiency and alternative technologies it is possible that the levels at which we currently consume oil and other non-renewable resources may not be the same levels that future generations will require. Hayward argues that a planner in the 1900's would not have secured oil for our generation but instead would have focused on securing horses for transportation needs, whale oil or fire wood for lighting and heating and rock salt to be used for refrigeration (Hayward, 2002).

2.5 Sustainability Reporting Sustainability reporting has grown due to the recognition by companies that attention is required to reporting on environmental and social issues in combination with the financial aspects of their business (Daub, 2007). Corporations have experienced an increased level of scrutiny around the impacts of their operations, not only on the bottom line but on the environment and society as a whole (ACCA, 2004). This trend has, in turn, placed pressure on corporations to incorporate the idea of sustainability into their core strategies and to place a focus on becoming more transparent by providing publically available information to showcase how they are working towards achieving the overall goal of sustainability (ACCA, 2004).

2.5.1 Sustainability Reports As previously outlined, the WBCSD (2002) defines sustainability reports "... as public reports by companies to provide internal and external stakeholders with a picture of corporate position and activities on economic, environmental and social dimensions. In short, such reports attempt to describe the company's contribution toward sustainable development." The Global Reporting Initiative similarly defines a sustainability report as being a "report published by a company or organization about the economic, environmental and social impacts caused by its everyday activities. A sustainability report also presents the organization's values and governance model, and

15

demonstrates the link between its strategy and its commitment to a sustainable global economy" (GRI, 2016b). At this time, there are few mandatory Sustainability Reporting requirements for companies in Canada. However, there has been some legislative activity that has encouraged reporting (CGA, 2005). For example, as of 1999 the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) requires that companies disclose and provide information on certain emissions to the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) (CGA, 2005). The NPRI tracks over 300 substances and requires that owners or operators of facilities that meet specific NPRI requirements produce a NPRI report (Government of Canada, 2013). Further, while there are no set requirements for the Oil and Gas industry, in 2002 the "Public Accountability Statements Regulations" were created requiring that all banks, insurance companies and trust and loan companies produce a Public Accountability Statement annually (Government of Canada, 2016).

2.5.2 GRI Guidelines While mandatory sustainability requirements are limited, there are a variety of initiatives that exist to help guide corporations in the reporting process. For example, the Global Reporting Initiative, which was founded in 1997, released their G4 guidelines for reporting in 2013 (GRI, 2016b). As another example, Stratos (2008) released a best practice guide on Canadian Corporate Sustainability Reporting; the report outlines best practices in sustainability reporting by 7 leading corporations. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development released "Sustainable Development Reporting: Striking the Balance" in 2002, which aims to demonstrate the value reporting can offer a corporation and provide guidance on how to report. Further to that, the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPICEA), in partnership with the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), released their third edition of voluntary reporting guidelines for the oil and gas industry in September of 2015 (IPIECA, 2016). That said, the GRI guidelines are by far the most widely used set of guidelines today.

16

The GRI framework quickly expanded from environmental reporting to include social and economic mechanisms as well; making it a rounded framework for sustainability reporting and not just environmental reporting (GRI, 2016b). Since its first release, there have been 3 updates. The most recent generation of guidelines, the G4 guidelines, was released in May 2013 (GRI, 2016b). The GRI also has a set of sector specific disclosure documents intended to help guide the unique needs of these identified sectors in the implementation of the G4 guidelines (GRI, 2016b). Sector specific supplements have been created for oil and gas, food processing, media, airport operators, electrical utilities, mining and metals, non-governmental organizations, financial services, event organizers and construction and real estate (GRI, 2016a). As of June 2014, over 5000 organizations had used the GRI guidelines and as of September, 2014, 20,000 reports had been registered in the GRI's Sustainability Disclosure database (GRI, 2014). According to a 2013 study completed by KPMG, 78% of global N100 companies sampled worldwide refer to the GRI guidelines in their corporate responsibility reports (KPMG, 2013). This is a 9% increase since 2011 (KPMG, 2013). The GRI guidelines aid an organization in developing their sustainability report by providing guidance on determining the aspects and boundaries that will be used during the creation of their report and by providing guidance on the information to be included in the report along with a set of indicators to be reported on by the corporation (GRI, 2013a). The G4 guidelines outline 91 indicators; 9 economic; 34 environmental; and 48 social indicators broken into 4 sub aspects, including human rights, product responsibility, society, and, finally, labor practices and decent work (GRI, 2013b). Reporting frameworks such as the GRI are beneficial to sustainability reporting as they aid in creating consistency in the reports being produced across companies making them easier to compare and provide companies with the credibility of a recognized guideline (KPMG, 2013). The GRI guidelines have been regarded as a result of successful institutional entrepreneurship aligned with the idea of institutionalization described previously (Brown et al., 2009). The key to the success of the GRI has been attributed to two main areas. The first is the timing of its release when the idea of social, economic and environmental reporting was at a forefront as well as the role of different
17

players (Brown et al., 2009). The second is the balance found between different pieces of the initiative, including collective versus individual interests or inclusiveness versus broader consultation and building something new versus challenging the institutions already in place (Brown et al., 2009). However, despite the benefits and success of these guidelines, critics offer feedback on the lack of an "explicit definition or reference to a definition" (Moneva et al., 2006) on sustainable development and the lack of indicators that look at an integration of each of the pillars of the triple bottom line (Moneva et al., 2006). Gray and Milne (2002) suggest that currently there is no sustainability reporting being done anywhere at this time. They argue that the only way to potentially report on a corporation's sustainability would be through "...a complete and transparent statement about the extent to which the organisation had contributed to - or, more likely, diminished- the sustainability of the planet. For that to occur, however, as we have seen, we need to have a detailed and complex analysis of the organisation's interactions with ecological systems, resources, habitats, and societies, and interpret this in the light of all other organisations' past and present impacts on those same systems" (Gray and Milne, 2002). In other words, they are arguing that truly reporting on a corporation's sustainability is much too complex a process. At best, Gray and Milne (2002) suggest that reporting we see to today is not sustainability reporting but rather "triple bottom line reporting" (Gray and Milne, 2002). McElroy et al. (2008) take this notion one step further, suggesting that reporting guidelines such as the GRI and other reporting initiatives fail to actually aid corporations in measuring and reporting on the sustainability of their operations. They elaborate to explain that this is because guidelines, like the GRI refer to the term "sustainability context" (McElroy et al., 2008). The GRI defines "sustainability context" as "The underlying question of sustainability reporting is how an organization contributes, or aims to contribute in the future, to the improvement or deterioration of economic, environmental and social conditions, developments, and trends at the local, regional or global level. Reporting only on trends in individual performance (or the efficiency of the organization) fails to respond to this underlying question. Reports should therefore seek to present performance in relation to broader concepts of sustainability" (GRI, 2013b). McElroy et al. (2008) suggest that, while this definition exists, the GRI does not clearly articulate how a corporation can
18

include "sustainability context" in their reporting, and as a result this is often missing from sustainability reports (McElroy et al., 2008). Nonetheless, sustainability reporting is still a necessary first step towards providing stakeholders with information that will allow them to understand the impacts a corporation has on each of the identified pillars. 2.6 Sustainability Indicators Sustainability indicators are tools that can be used by not only corporations but industry to help with not only assessing performance but also with planning and improving their operations (Al-Sharrah et al., 2010). Epstein (2008) outline that companies face challenges when it comes to demonstrating the link between a company's actions and their environmental, social and financial performance; indicators allow for this link to be quantified (Epstein, 2008).

2.6.1 Indicators Key performance indicators help to measure and provide transparency around the progress a corporation is making when it comes to achieving the goals and milestones they have set out (PwC, 2007). Indicators aid in understanding by allowing for the simplification of complex information, like the environment and society (Turnhout et al., 2007). Measuring the corporation's performance against indicators allows for the communication of this information to both internal and external stakeholders; indicators can aid both employees and investors in making decisions about the corporations, as well as help communities and governments to better understand the impacts of the corporation (Keeble et al., 2003). According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), a challenge faced when developing performance indicators is ensuring that they allow for both decision makers and readers to effectively understand and assess if the corporation is meeting its outlined strategy (PwC, 2007). Further, it is important to note that performance indicators will vary by corporation depending on the industry they operate in and their strategy (PwC, 2007). For a performance indicator to be classified as a sustainability indicator "they must convey information concerning any of the dimensions of sustainable development except purely financial ones; this would include indicators capturing sustainable
19

development, sustainability, sustainable production, environmental performance, social performance, and eco-efficiency" (Palme and Tillman, 2008) and they must also "be connected to a vision, goal, or target of sustainable development" (Palme and Tillman, 2008). It is important to note that sustainability indicators have been criticized for condensing large and complex processes into what may seem as a quite simple measure (Bell and Morse, 2008). Sustainability indicators looking at the environment, often try to simplify scientific and ecological knowledge, specifically related to the relationship of "cause and effect", which in and of itself is a highly complex system making it very difficult to measure within limited parameters (Thurnhout et al., 2007). Ironically, this very piece of criticism is also one of the benefits of any performance indicator as outlined above. When developing sustainability indicators it is important for the corporation to understand the needs and requirements of both the internal and external stakeholders as their interests can vary (Keeble et al., 2003). The final set of indicators determined by a corporation should ensure they consider the needs of both groups (Keeble et al., 2003).

2.6.2 Corporate Sustainability Indicators As outlined above, one of the biggest challenges faced by any corporation related to sustainability actions is "quantifying the link between corporate actions and environmental, social and financial performance" (Epstein, 2008). The implementation of indicators at the corporate level aids in drawing this line so that corporations have a better understanding of the overall impacts of their initiatives. Some work has been done to establish indicator guidelines at the corporate level. For example, as previously noted the GRI G4 guidelines present 91 indicators to be used by corporations (GRI, 2013b). As outlined by Azapagic (2004), when considering the development of corporate sustainability indicators it is critical that industry specific sustainability issues are considered and that the indicators reflect those issues. The GRI has recognized this through the development of its sector specific supplements.
20

Many companies do still develop their own set of indicators. As noted by Searcy et al. (2008), in doing this, the first step would be to develop what priorities the corporation chooses to focus on as this will set the stage for the remaining pieces of development. Other work worthy of consideration in the area of corporate sustainability indicators include a study aimed specifically at identifying the most common corporate sustainability indicators (Rahdari and Rostamy, 2015). To do this the study focused on existing frameworks, reporting guidelines, management systems and rating systems for corporate governance, corporate social responsibility and sustainability (Rahdari and Rostamy, 2015). Rahdari and Rostamy (2015) found that environmental indicators accounted for nearly half (48.63%) of the indicators. PwC (2009) sponsored a report examining corporate sustainability reporting in Canada through surveys. The intent was to identify issues and best practices related to voluntary reporting across a number of industries (PwC, 2009). One of their key calls to action was a need for industry specific standardized reporting (PwC, 2009). Further, work has been done on the process for developing corporate sustainability indicators, reports and frameworks. For example, Searcy et al. (2008) which looks at the process of identifying priority areas for action within a corporation and the process leading to the development of indicators; Searcy and Buslovich (2014) who interviewed experts from 35 Canadian corporations to understand how these corporations both develop and use sustainability reports; Azapagic (2004) which proposed a generic framework for sustainable development indicators to be used by mining and mineral corporations; and Adams and Frost (2008) who conducted interviews with 3 Australian and 4 British corporations to collect information which would allow them to better understand how corporations develop performance indicators and use these indicators in decision making. The study concluded that across the 7 corporations there were varied approaches to indicator selection, reporting and the use of indicators in decision making (Adams and Frost, 2008). This finding is consistent with the other studies noted. Other areas of focus have been the specific indicators disclosed within sustainability reports. For example, Roca and Searcy (2012) completed a content analysis of 2008
21

sustainability reports produced by 94 Canadian corporations. In completing this content analysis, they examined both the specific indicators used in the reports along with the use of GRI indicators in these reports (Roca and Searcy, 2012). Gallego (2006) looked at 19 Spanish corporations spanning 4 different sectors who report environmental, social and economic information as per the GRI guidelines. The aim was to verify how the corporation used these GRI indicators and how this in turn can impact sustainable development (Gallego, 2006). They conclude that knowledge of the information provided by these reports through the indicators disclosed can impact sustainable development positively (Gallego, 2006). However, in order for this to happen, all firms in all sectors and countries must provide this type of information (Gallego, 2006).

2.6.3 The Role of Indicators Indicators are critical tools used by corporations to measure success towards its outlined goals, further, indicators allow for a corporation to understand their current positon as it relates to these goals so that they can develop new strategies if required (Brockett and Rezaee, 2012). Daub (2007) suggest that performance indicators represent "the heart of a sustainability report", and places more emphasis on the inclusion of this quantitative information over qualitative information since indicators provide solid measureable information. PwC (2007) further outlines the importance of performance indicators and their link to the corporation's strategy and objectives, however, they outline that this quantitative and qualitative information must be presented together to ensure a complete understating of the information by the reader. Keeble et al. (2003) address how sustainability indicators can be used at both the corporate and project level by examining 2 case studies. The first study aims to measure sustainability performance across a corporation (Keeble et al., 2003). The second study aims to measure project activities and their alignment with sustainable development principles (Keeble et al., 2003). They conclude with 3 main findings. First, that debate within an organization when developing indicators should be encouraged as it is part of the learning process (Keeble et al., 2003). Second, stakeholders external to the corporation should be involved in the process however, in the end it is critical that
22

those accountable within the organization understand how they can aid in reaching the desired results (Keeble et al., 2003). Finally, using frameworks and developed standards can be helpful however, the process of developing indicators by internal stakeholders helps to develop a feeling of ownership over the results (Keeble et al., 2003). In essence, indicators play a role within an organization far beyond acting solely as a communication tool, they help to establish accountability and develop a mindset. Bassen and Kovács (2008) suggest that the performance of a corporation extends beyond just the financials and that indicators addressing sustainability are critical for comprehensive firm evaluation by investors.

2.7 Reporting in the Oil and Gas Sector Both the size and geopolitical stability of the oil sands in Alberta make them ideal for development (Poveda, 2015). Nonetheless, they are also the focus of much attention due to the potential social and environmental impacts which are currently receiving attention worldwide (Poveda, 2015). That said, the majority of major industry players have taken up the process of sustainability reporting; which, as previously discussed allows for transparency and communication by the industry with its stakeholders. As such, it is no surprise that there has been research completed looking at the oil and gas industry specifically as it relates to the context of sustainability and sustainability reporting both globally and in Canada. At the global level, Schneider et al. (2013) looked at 10 oil and gas corporations to evaluate their progress towards sustainability of environment, health and safety (EHS) initiatives. To complete the study the EHS policies of each corporation were analyzed. This included mission and vision statements as they related to EHS, metrics reported, legal compliance and overall EHS initiatives (Schneider et al., 2013). The study concluded that while the industry has made progress toward sustainability, benchmarking, as it relates to the EHS categories examined, continues to be an issue due to inconsistencies in the reporting (Schneider et al., 2013). Another report by Asaolu et al. (2011) completed a content analysis of reports produced by 6 oil and gas corporations operating in Nigeria. Corporations were ranked against one another based
23

on a rating system developed using the GRI and IPICEA guidance for voluntary reporting to determine the extent to which these corporations were reporting against international best practices (Asaolu et al., 2011). Sun (2011) completed a study examining the stock performance of sustainability leaders in the oil and gas industry as identified by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. He concluded that sustainability leaders in this industry have a stock which outperforms those of lagging corporations, suggesting a positive reaction by investors to corporate sustainability (Sun, 2011). As it relates to Alberta, Poveda (2015) looked at the information being reported by 6 oil sands operators/producers for the 4 most common environmental impacts associated with the industry (i.e. land use, greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, tailings ponds and water use), outlined by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). The intent of the research was to give a broad understanding of the state of each of these areas based on the statistics provided by the individual corporations (Poveda, 2015). Poveda (2015) concluded that while regulatory requirements were being met, the lack of standardization across the 6 corporations made benchmarking on the 4 areas examined challenging. A thesis completed at Trent University in 2012 examined sustainability reports for 4 oil sands corporations with the aim of addressing the question "Should the energy industry operating in the oil sands follow and commit to a more normative approach of the natural-resource based view in their sustainable development strategies, and thereby become more responsible corporate stewards?" (Eve, 2012). The report previously cited by Roca and Searcy (2012) examined indicators disclosed in sustainability reports from 94 Canadian corporations across a variety of industries. Roca and Searcy (2012) found that the oil and gas industry reported the largest number of different indicators in their reports, followed by the mining and transport industries. This same study also found that of the 13 oil and gas corporations included, 46% or 6 of them, highlighted GRI indicators in their reports (Roca and Searcy, 2012). As highlighted by Roca and Searcy (2012) these findings line up with Deegan and Gordon (1996) who also found there to be larger disclosures by firms who worked in environmentally high impact industries and suggested that these disclosures were used
24

to provide legitimacy of the corporations operations. Adams and Frost (2008) found there to be similarities on the issues receiving focus across corporations operating within the same industries and outlined that environmental issues were of strong focus by corporations operating in environmentally high impact industries. However, they did note that while environmental issues were of strong focus for these corporations, there were inconsistencies in the type and amount of specific information being provided, even amongst those operating in the same industry and country (Adams and Frost, 2008).

2.8 Conclusions The literature review demonstrates that substantial work has been completed on understanding the idea of corporate sustainability and how sustainability reporting and sustainability indicators are used as tools by corporations to communicate and show their progress in achieving their overall corporate sustainability goals. The review also demonstrates that the GRI is the most widely used reporting guideline by corporations when preparing their reports. However, very little work has been done at the sector level, specifically within Alberta's oil and gas industry, to understand the consistency and comparability of reports being produced. This is an area which should be explored further in order to truly gauge the effectiveness of reports in achieving their overall goal of reporting on corporate sustainability. While the sharing of a corporation's environmental, social and economic performance is important in and of itself, it lacks any real usefulness in creating change and identifying leaders and laggards if it cannot be compared and benchmarked to that of its peers, and related to the broader sustainability context in which the firm operates.

2.9 Motivations for Research The purpose of this literature review was to understand and document the available research in the areas of sustainability reporting, sustainability indicators and reporting within the Alberta oil sands industry in Canada. What this research has shown is that, while there is wide availability of research looking at each of these topics on their own, little information is available on the use of indicators within the Alberta oil sands industry
25

or the consistency and comparability of reporting and indicator use in this industry. In order for reporting and the use of indicators to drive the common goal of achieving sustainability, stakeholders need to be able to understand how each of these corporations measure up to one another. This is the gap this research seeks to address. While standards, such as the GRI, do exist for corporations to use, there is no mandatory set of reporting guidelines or industry specific indicators. This leaves reporting and indicator development entirely up to the discretion of the specific corporation producing the report. The motivation for completing this research is, therefore to understand how the industry has progressed in this area by looking at the use of indicators across the industry and the consistency of both reporting and indicator use. It is suspected that there will be large variability in the information produced across the industry, making it difficult for stakeholders when reading these reports to understand the impacts of the industry and how these corporations measure up against one another.

2.10 Research Questions This research intends to explore both the current state of sustainability reporting as well as the evolution of sustainability reporting within Canada's Oil and Gas industry.

2.10.1 Central Question The central question for this research study is: How consistently are corporations operating in the Canadian oil sands industry measuring and communicating their sustainability performance to stakeholders?

2.10.2 Sub Questions The following sub questions have been developed to help answer the central question.

26

1. What indicators are currently being reported by the corporations operating in the Canadian oil sands industry? 2. How consistent is reporting and indicator use across corporations operating in the Canadian oil sands industry? 3. How has the use of indicators and the consistency of reporting across the industry evolved over time?

3 Methods This research focused on a content analysis of the sustainability reports produced by 13 companies operating as producers in the Canadian oil sands. A qualitative analysis of reports produced by these companies in both 2010 and 2014 provided a database of indicators reported on by the industry for both time periods. Reviewing reports for both time periods also provided insight to the evolution of the industry in this area over time. An overview of the research approach is provided in Figure 1.

3.1 Content Analysis Qualitative content analysis provided the basis for this research. For the purpose of this research the definition of content analysis offered by Krippendorff (2013) was used. Krippendorff (2013) states that content analysis is "a systematic reading of a body of texts, images, and symbolic matter" and defined as "a research technique for making replicable and valid inferences from texts (or other meaningful matter) to the contexts of their use" (Krippendorff, 2013). Krippendorff (2013) also describes qualitative content analysis specifically as being "interpretive" and outlines that this method of analysis involves the close reading of a small amount of text (Krippendorff, 2013). Krippendorff (2013) outlines three points which may spark a researcher to take on a content analysis: 1) Text Driven Content Analysis ­ this type of analysis stems from a researcher's interest in a certain set of texts (Krippendorff, 2013). 2) Problem Driven Content Analysis ­ this type of analysis stems from a researcher's interest in a certain question that they believe they may be able to answer by analyzing specific texts (Krippendorff, 2013). 3) Method-Driven Content Analysis ­ stems from a researcher wanting to apply analytical practices to an area not yet explored using those specific practices which however, have been explored via other means (Krippendorff, 2013). This research stemmed from a belief that there may be inconsistency in the information being provided in sustainability reports produced by oil and gas corporations operating in Canada's oil sands industry. This was based on the fact that the literature review conducted has shown inconsistencies in sustainability reporting to date. This is therefore, a problem driven content analysis. Krippendorff (2013) provides nine steps an analyst may take to achieve the inferences they set out for. An inference is defined as "the act or process of reaching a conclusion about something from known facts or

28

evidence" (Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 2015). Table 1 shows the 9 steps outlined by Krippendorff (2013) and how they were addressed for this research. Table 1: 9 Steps for Content Analysis ­ Krippendorff (2013)
Step: 1. Formulating a Research Question Description: The research question set out to be addressed is: How consistently are corporations operating in the Canadian oil sands industry measuring and communicating their sustainability performance to stakeholders? Several sub questions were also outlined earlier. 2. Ascertaining stable correlations Sustainability Reports are becoming the commonly used method of communicating sustainability performance by corporations. It is believed that these reports can provide the necessary information to draw a conclusion on the effectiveness of the information being measured and communicated by the Canadian oil sands industry. As such, these reports will act as the focus texts for the content analysis. As outlined above, Sustainability Reports produced by corporations will be the focus of the content analysis. These reports are publically available and were retrieved from the selected corporation's websites. For the purpose of this study, the entire pdf of the Sustainability Reports were studied for each corporation. Indicators were extracted from tables, charts and performance scorecards/indicator summary sections or similar areas within the reports. Description: Sample texts were identified as sustainability reports produced by the 13 corporations who make up Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA). Further details are provided in section 3.3. Sample Selection.

3. Locating relevant texts

4. Defining and identifying relevant units in texts

Step: 5. Sampling the texts

6. Developing coding categories and recording instructions 7. Selecting an analytical procedure

Reports were read in full and indicators, as defined earlier were recorded as anything found in a chart, table or an Indicator Summary/Performance Scorecard section or similar. Spreadsheets were developed for each corporation for each time period. As indicators were identified they were recorded in the appropriate spreadsheet. These raw data spreadsheets can be found in Appendix 1 and 2 for 2010 and 2014, respectively. Further information on the analytical procedures can be found in section 3.4 Data Analysis. In order to ensure that the same methods were employed for each report examination, a test for reliability was completed. Further information on this test can be found in section 3.2 Reliability. Not applicable for this study as there was only one analyst.

3.2 Reliability In any form of research, showing reliability in the methods is critical to establishing confidence in the data (Krippendorff, 2013). When it comes to content analysis, Krippendorff (2013) outlines three types of reliability: (1) Stability ­ proving that the research methods employed will achieve the same results at different times (Krippendorff, 2013). (2) Replicability ­ proving the extent research methods employed can return the same results regardless of the analyst and under different situations (Krippendorff, 2013). (3) Accuracy ­ comparing the research methods employed to the results of other research methods designed and considered to be correct methods (Krippendorff, 2013). For the purpose of this thesis, and based on the resources available, only stability was measured using a test-retest method as recommended by Krippendorff (2013). Two of the corporation's sustainability reports were analyzed in full and then re-analyzed using the exact same method one week later. The reports were Cenovus and Imperial Oil for the 2014 reporting period. The test-retest showed that the research methods employed yield the same results by the same analyst when completed one week apart. All indicators captured in the initial review were also captured in the retest. This confirmed that using charts, table, and indicator summary sheets to extract indicators was a effective method of data extraction.

3.3 Sample Selection This study examined industry associations in order to determine the sample for analysis. This was a clear way of bounding the analysis. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) was the first association reviewed. It had 81 registered producer companies of oil and natural gas in Canada. However, the issue with using this association was that it does not isolate out oil sands producers. As such, the second industry association examined was Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance
30

(COSIA). COSIA's focus is on environmental improvement in the industry through collaboration and innovation; and is made up of 13 member companies who account for 90% of oil sands production in Canada (COSIA, 2016c). The 13 member companies outlined in Table 2, along with employee's counts for both time periods, formed the basis for this analysis. Employee counts were pulled from the associated reports or annual reports. Table 2: Sample

3.4 Data Collection and Analysis The content analysis for this study looked at the entirety of the reports published by each corporation for two time periods, 2010 and 2014. While corporations do use any reporting standards like the GRI, not all corporations apply the standards in the exact same way, as such, all indicators reported were included in this study. Only reports published in a downloadable pdf format were included. In some cases, corporations produced a "summary report" which is available for download while remaining aspects of the report could be found on their website. In those cases, this was noted and only the summary report was examined. While these reports were titled summary, they were the downloadable report available for public use. Table 3 summarizes how the research questions were addressed.

The following assumptions were used to answer and address each of the research sub questions:
(1) What indicators are currently being reported by these corporations?

Reports were reviewed in their entirety for "indicators". Indicators are defined as "A set of quantifiable measures that a company or industry uses to gauge or compare performance in terms of meeting their strategic and operational goal" (Investopedia, 2016) and were extracted from tables and charts throughout the report, along with indicator summary/performance summary sections or similar areas of the report. Each time an indicator was identified, the name of the indicator was placed in a company specific spreadsheet. The measurement unit/area, page number and section title were also recorded. An example is provided in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Indicator Recording Sheet Two spreadsheets were maintained; one for each reporting period. Each spreadsheet had company specific tabs. The first step was to review the reports for all corporations during each time period. Once this was complete, spreadsheets were compiled and the indicator database was developed. This was done by manually cross checking each
32

corporation's indicator spreadsheet and developing a master spreadsheet for each time period. To streamline data and avoid double counting when identifying indicators, the indicator at a high level was captured and in the "measurement unit/area" section of the spreadsheet any business areas or geographies were noted. For example, if a company reported "Indirect GHG/CO2e Emissions" and reported it for 3 different business areas the business areas were noted in the "measurement unit/area" section. To ensure that this information was not omitted, both a "category" and a "subcategory" were identified during the creation of the master spreadsheet. Figure 3 shows the use of the indicator "Gas Flaring" as an example. This indicator was determined to be reported by 7 corporations in 2014. Of those 7 corporations, 4 reported the indicator as a total number, while the other 3 reported the indicator as a business operation/area specific number. Nonetheless, the indicator was determined at a high level to be "Gas Flaring" regardless of how the company chose to report. The subcategories were then determined to be "Total" and "By Operation/Business Area". If a company reported on a specific indicator in more than 1 sub-category group it was recorded. However, when summing up the total number of reports including that indicator it was only counted once (to eliminate double counting). Appendix 3 and 4 outline all indicators and sub categories of indicators for 2010 and 2014 respectively. They also specifically identify which corporations reported each indicator and by what specific sub category they reported.

In order to analyze consistency in reporting across the industry above and beyond the actual indicators themselves relevant themes associated with each pillar of sustainability were outlined. Themes were not predetermined. Instead to eliminate bias, themes emerged through an inductive analysis during indicator retrieval. This led to the identification of 12 themes for the 2010 reports and 13 themes for the 2014 reports. Table 3 outlines each of the 13 themes and their associated sustainability pillar. Note that during the 2010 reporting period the Aboriginal theme was absent. Further details including definition for each theme are outlined in the analysis and discussion in section 4. Table 4: Themes and Pillars
Environmental Emissions/Air Energy Water Land Waste Environmental Violations/Other Social Communities/Charitable Involvement Business Integrity Employees Aboriginals Health and Safety Economic Financial Operations

Once indicator extraction was completed themes were determined by examining indicators for similarities. Once a list of themes was determined an additional column was added to each corporation's recording worksheet to identify the theme of each indicator. See Figure 4.

(3) How has the use of indicators and the consistency of reporting across the

industry evolved over time? The analysis methods described above for questions one and two were replicated for reports produced by each reporting corporation in both 2010 and 2014. This information provided the basis for analysis and comparison of reports over time. Indicators recorded in the indicator databases for both 2010 and 2014 for all corporations were compared and analyzed. Section 4 outlines the result and analysis for both time periods. An analysis of reports at a high level was completed followed by an analysis of indicators on the individual indicator level, the theme level and finally the pillar level.

Results and Analysis

4.1 Sample As outlined previously, this analysis was made up of 13 member companies of COSIA who account for 90% of oil sands production (COSIA, 2016c). Table 5 outlines each corporation along with the corporation's international headquarters and the availability of a report for each time period. The reports reviewed are reports published in 2010 reviewing 2009 data and reports published in 2014 reviewing 2013 data. For 2010, reports were available for 11 out of the 13 corporations; 2 of the 11 corporations did not have specific reports reviewing 2009 data. For those corporations, ConocoPhillips and Syncrude Energy, the 2008 and 2008/2009 combination reports were used, respectively. For 2014, reports were available for all 13 corporations. However, note that 2 of the reports, ConocoPhillips and Devon Corporation, were combinations of 2013/2014 data. Of the 13 corporations, 8 have their corporate headquarters in Alberta, Canada; 2 are headquartered in the United States of America; 1 in the United Kingdom; 1 in Norway and 1 in France.

4.1.1 Report Presence and Type The study consisted of a content analysis of reports published by oil sand production corporations related to their sustainability performance in an attempt to understand the availability of industry specific information. As such, a variety of different reports across corporations were identified. When available, specific oil sands reports were used. However, if this type of report was not available the corporation's general sustainability report was used. During the analysis a number of different naming conventions were recognized. Figure 5 and 6 show the naming conventions of reports produced by companies in 2010 and 2014, respectively. The data shows that over the 4 year time period, the number of companies producing some form of a standalone Sustainability report or similar increased from 11 companies out of 13 to 13 out of 13. However, the naming conventions used and the subsequent information included continue to vary. The largest number of the reports produced, 55% in 2010 and 38% in 2014, used the term "Sustainable" or "Sustainability" report or review. In 2010, the remaining 45% of reports produced spanned varying naming conventions, while in 2014 23% of the remaining reports were titled as "Corporate Responsibility" or "Corporate Social Responsibility". Finally, in 2010 only 1 company was producing a specific report covering oil sands, while in 2014 this number increased to 2 companies or 15% of the sample. While reports had different naming conventions, the general subjects and scope of the reports was fairly consistent at a top level. However, the depth in which they covered oil sand specific information was quite variable and appeared to be dependent on the presence of their company in other global markets and types of operations. Further, the varying report names may be reflective of differing interpretations of sustainability by each of the corporations operating in Canada's oil sands industry.

Figure 6: Breakdown of Reports by Type ­ 2014 4.1.2 Report Lengths For each report type, and the reports as a whole, the mean, median, minimum and maximum lengths were calculated and documented in Table 6 and Table 7 for 2010 and 2014, respectively. Note that the length of reports was determined by the number of pages end to end of the downloaded pdf document. The average length of reports increased over the 4 year period from 45 pages in 2010 to 56 pages in 2014. Outliers to this data include a 2 page report by Cenovus in 2010. This report highlighted only some basic performance and had 0 indicators. On the longer side of things, was the report produced by Teck. This report sat at 118 pages in 2010 and increased to 134 pages in 2014. Teck is a global company with operations and projects spanning North and South America and corporate offices on 5 continents; this report covers the entirety of their operations. In terms of reports falling within the "Sustainability/Sustainable Development Report/Review" category, the average length
37

of report followed the same trend as all reports, increasing from a mean of 59 pages in 2010 to 72 pages in 2014. If Teck is removed from the data as an outlier, the average page length of reports in this category sits at 48 and 57 pages in 2010 and 2014, respectively. This is much closer to the average for all reports during that time period. Reports falling within the "Corporate Responsibility/Corporate Social Responsibility Report" category were on average 57 pages long, with the shortest being 52 pages and the longest being 64 pages in 2014. Due to 2010 having only 1 report in this category, year over year comparisons do not lead to any tangible conclusions. Table 6: Report Length by Type ­ 2010

4.2 Indicator Presentation The data contained in this section shows at a high level, the way in which these corporations are presenting indicator data in their reports and how this has changed over time.

4.2.1 Indicator Summaries For each report available in each time period the report was manually searched to check for the presence of an indicator summary or table of indicators. This would be any section in the report in which the company specifically summarizes their list of indicators. Figure 7 shows the number of reports with this type of summary or table. It shows that in 2010 only 5 of the 11 companies, or 45%, of the companies reporting summarised their indicators. This number increase to 7 out of 13, or 54%, just over half summarising their indicators in 2014. The total number of companies using this type of summary increased over the 4 year period from 5 to 7. However, it is noteworthy, that 1 of the 5 companies with a summary sheet in 2010 no longer included this summary in their 2014 report. As such, over the 4 year period, 3 net new companies began including this type of summary in their report.

Figure 7: Presence of an Indicator Summary Upon closer review of the indicator summaries, it was noted that naming varied by report. Naming conventions in 2010 were "BP in Figures", "Statistics", "Business
39

Highlight Data and Citizenship Performance Data", "2009 Performance Indicators" and "Performance Overview". In 2014 naming conventions included "BP in Figures", "Performance Scorecard", "Performance Data", "Performance Report Data", "Our Performance", "Key Performance Indicators" and "Performance Overview Table". Nonetheless they all followed a similar pattern of highlighting the indicator name and measurement down the left side of the page and included the data by year across the remaining columns. Since a large number of reports did not include this type of indicator summary for both time periods, reports were searched in their entirety for any additional tables or charts that highlighted performance data. This allowed for a comprehensive list of indicators to be developed taking into account that each of the companies chose different methods of presenting their data. Figure 8 shows the breakdown of where indicators were found (Summary Sheet, Table or Chart) in reports by year.

Figure 8: Breakdown of Indicators by Presentation In both timeframes it is evident that the majority of indicators identified were found in a summary sheet. In 2010, tables made up the second most common area to find indicators. In 2014 this switched to charts.

4.3 Database of Indicators The first research question focused on determining what indicators the industry is currently reporting on. To answer this question reports for each time period were manually searched in full to identify and compile a database of both high level indicators and associated sub-categories of indicators. These can be found in Appendix 3 and 4 for 2010 and 2014, respectively.

4.3.1 2010 Reports For the 2010 time period, the 10 companies analyzed resulted in a total of 453 indicators being reported. This is on average 45 indicators per report. Cenovus was excluded from this part of the study as their report did not actually report on any indicators, and as stated above, amounted to a 2 page fact sheet. As such 2010 numbers are based on 10 reporting corporations. The indicators were cross referenced and compared to identify overlap in the indicators and sub-categories of indicators being used by multiple corporations. This comparison lead to the identification of 272 unique high level indicators being reported on across the industry. Of the 272 indicators, 221 or 81% of the indicators were only reported by 1 corporation. The remaining 51 indicators, or 19%, were reported on by at least 2 corporations. Of the 51 indicators that were reported by 2 or more corporations only 9 indicators, or 3% of the total, were reported on by more than half of the corporations. Table 8 summarizes all of the indicators which were reported on by 2 or more corporations for the 2010 reports. A complete list of all indicators can be found in Appendix 3. Note that multiple indicators were addressing essentially the same core issue in many cases, for example, ghg emissions.

4.3.2 2014 Reports For the 2014 time period, the 13 companies analyzed resulted in a total of 528 indicators being reported. This is on average 41 indicators per report. These indicators were cross referenced and compared to identify overlap in the indicators and subcategories of indicators being used by multiple corporations. This comparison lead to the identification of 272 unique high level indicators being reported on across the industry. Of the 272 indicators 199, or 73% of the indicators, were reported by 1 corporation. The remaining 73 indicators, or 27%, were reported on by more than one corporation. Of the 73 indicators that were reported by 2 or more corporations, only 5 indicators, or 2% of the total, were reported on by more than half of the corporations. Table 10 summarizes all of the indicators which were reported on by 2 or more corporations for the 2014 reports. A complete list of all indicators can be found in

Appendix 4. Again, note that many of the indicators were used to measure essentially the same core issue in many cases, such as for ghg emissions once more. Table 10: 2014 Indicators Reported on by 2 or More Corporations

For 2014, Syncrude Canada Ltd. once again reported the most number of indicators, 145. The report with the least number of reported indicators, 8, was produced by Devon Canada Corporation, which had not produced a report for the 2010 reporting period. Table 11 shows the number of indicators by report.

4.3.3 Database of Indicators - Year over Year Comparison The purpose of this section is to look at a year over year comparison of the indicators reported to see how these have changed over time. Table 12 shows the indicators reported on by 2 or more corporations during both reporting periods. Recall, that in 2010 51 indicators had been reported by 2 or more corporations, and in 2014, this number increased to 73 indicators being reported on by 2 or more corporations. This shows a positive trend in the industry towards consistency of indicators being reported in the industry. After cross-referencing, it was evident that there were 41 indicators which were reported by 2 or more corporations in both time periods. In other words, of the 51 indicators reported on by more than 1 corporation in 2010 only 41 were also reported on by more than 1 corporation in 2014. Of the remaining 10 indicators, 6 were reported by 1 corporation in 2014 and 4 were not reported at all in 2014. Also noteworthy, is that in 2014 73 indicators were reported by 2 or more corporations, and as we know 41 of those indicators were also reported on by more than one corporation in 2010. Of the remaining 32 indicators, 18 had been reported on by 1 corporation in 2010, and 14 were new indicators in 2014. Seeing as these net new indicators were all reported on by at least 2 corporations, this could indicate some degree of alignment across the industry for emerging areas requiring reporting attention.

4.4 Indicators by Theme This section examines how indicators span major themes in the oil sand industry. All of the indicators were divided into theme groups and then each theme group was associated with one of the pillars of sustainability. As outlined in the methods, theme groups were determined once indicator extraction was completed by examining indicators for similarities. Once the list of themes was determined, indicators were grouped accordingly. From reviewing the reports, 12 themes emerged for the 2010 reporting period and 13 themes emerged for the 2014 reporting period. All indicators fit into 1 of these themes. Table 13 outlines a description of each of the themes.

48

Table 13: Themes and Descriptions
Theme: Emissions/Air Description: Indicators on emissions to air. This can be emissions by different types or air exceedances. It also includes carbon credits or offsets. Indicators on energy usage, energy costs, sources of energy or energy generation. Indicators relating to water usage. For example, quality, type or treatment, recycled water and water use or outputs to water. Indicators relating to spills and non-compliance issues. Anything related to land disturbances, abandonments, wildlife, wells, tailings and waste rock. Indicators relating to waste production, treatment or waste types. Indicators relating to number of incidents or fines and penalties paid out for environmental exceedances, noncompliance or environmental accidents. Indicators related to community, charitable or educational investments. This includes time investments, programs or initiatives the corporation is involved with and monetary investments. Indicators related to ethics or integrity committees or complaints as well as programs or hotlines. Indicators related to total employees or employee diversity. This includes employees by job types, employee recognition or development and training. Indicators directed specifically at spending or involvement with aboriginal communities. While this could be grouped into communities and charitable involvement these are separated due to the emphasis on this theme specifically for the 2014 reporting period. Indicators relating to health and safety initiatives and performance. For example, indicators related to wellness programs or injury frequency. Indicators relating to expenses of a company. Examples include payment of taxes and royalties or shareholder payments. This can include salaries, bonuses and other capital expenditures. Indicators related to the operations of a company including total production, exploration, offices or procurement of goods and services.

For the 2010 reporting time period the most common themes to emerge amongst the indicators were (1) Employees, (2) Emissions/Air, and (3) Health and Safety. Fifty three percent of the indicators reported in 2010 fell into one of these three categories. The only theme for which all 10 companies reported on was the "Emissions/Air" theme. Even though "Employees" emerged as the top theme for number of reported indicators, only 8 out of the 10 reporting companies reported on an indicator in this theme. Both Suncor Energy and Shell Canada did not report on an indicator in this theme. "Health and Safety", which emerged as the third most common theme, only had 9 of the 10 reporting companies. Shell Canada also did not report on an indicator falling into this theme. While the three themes identified above had the most number of indicators reported, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean that all companies are aligned on reporting themes. When looking at the number of companies reporting on a specific theme, the top three themes were (1) Emissions/Air, which has all 10 corporations reporting on this theme, and (2) Land, Waste and Employees which all had 8 corporations reporting. As an example of how a theme was comprised of individual indicators consider the "Emissions/Air" theme. For the "Emissions/Air" the 82 identified indicators fit into 44 high
50

level indicators with a variety of sub-categories. Only 10, 23%, of these high level indicators were reported on by 2 or more corporations. Table 15 outlines these 10 high level indicators and sub-categories. The remaining 34 high level indicators, were only reported on by 1 corporation, and can be found in Appendix 3 along with the identified sub-categories.

Table 15 demonstrates that at the indicator level, there is a lack of alignment across corporations. Only 1 high level indicator "GHG/CO2e Emissions" had all reporting corporations providing the same data; a company total. The remaining high level indicators may have had multiple corporations reporting, however, there was inconsistency in the way in which the indicator was reported. For example, the "NOx Emissions" high level indicator was reported on by 5 corporations. Of those, 3 corporations reported it as a company total, and 3 reported it for specific business areas or operations within the company. Only 1 of the 5 corporations reported it in both ways. Complete breakdowns of counts and reporting corporations can be found in Appendix 3.

For the 2014, reporting period the most common themes to emerge amongst the indicators were (1) Emissions/Air, (2) Employees, and (3) Health and Safety. The indicators identified in each of these 3 themes accounted for 50% of the reported indicators. While "Health and Safety" was the third most popular in terms of number of indicators it was the only theme which was represented across all 13 corporations. "Emissions/Air" which was the most popular in terms of number of indicators reported; representing 18% of the total reported indicators was only reported on by 12 of the 13 corporations. Devon Canada Corporation did not report on an indicator within this theme. The "Employees" theme which represented 17% of the total reported indicators was only reported on by 8 of the 13 corporations. When looking at themes based on the number of reporting corporations the top three themes become (1) Health and Safety, with all 13 companies reporting on an indicator in this theme, (2) Emissions/Air and land, which both have 12 of the 13 corporations reporting on an indicator in this theme. As an example of how a theme was comprised of individual indicators consider the "Health and Safety" theme. For the "Health and Safety" theme, the 76 indicators fit into
52

27 high level indicators with a variety of sub-categories. Only 8, 30%, of these high level indicators were reported on by 2 or more corporations. Table 17 outlines these 8 high level indicators and sub-categories. The remaining 19 high level indicators, were only reported on by 1 corporation, and can be found in Appendix 4 along with the identified sub-categories.

Table 17 once again demonstrates inconsistency at the indicator level. In 2014, none of the high level indicators for the "Health and Safety" theme were reported on by all corporations in the same way. "Recordable Injury Frequency/Rate" was the most commonly reported high level indicator, with 12 of the 13 corporations reporting. However, only 10 corporations reported on this as a company total. The remaining 2 corporations were Imperial Oil, which reported for 2 sub-categories ­ "Employees" and "Contractors", and Canadian Natural Resources, which reported for 1 sub-category ­
53

"by Operation/Business Area". Interesting to note is that of the 12 reporting corporations on this indicator, 8 reported on the indicator strictly as a total number and 2 reported across multiple sub-categories. These 2 were Statoil, which reported this indicator as both a total number as well as for specific business areas/operations, and Syncrude which reported the indicator as a total and also as an employee number and contractor number, touching 3 of the sub categories. Similar widespread inconsistencies can be found among all indicators spanning all themes. Complete breakdowns of counts and reporting corporations can be found in Appendix 4.

4.4.3 Indicators by Theme - Year over Year Comparison This section looks at a year over year comparison of the identified themes to understand how reporting on these themes has evolved over time. Specifically it looks at the number of indicators per theme and number of corporations reporting on each theme. Table 16 highlights the number of indicators reported for each theme for each time period as well as both the absolute number and percentage change over the 4 year period.

When looking at the number of indicators being reported by theme there was relatively little change over time, as the top 3 themes reported remained the same. During the 2010 reporting period, the themes reported with the most number of indicators were "Employees", "Emissions/Air", and "Health and Safety". For the 2014 reporting period, while the top three themes remained the same, they did change in order to become "Emissions/Air", "Employees", and "Health and Safety". This shows some stability in terms of the issues the industry is focusing their reporting efforts on. The "Aboriginal" theme was a theme that emerged when reviewing the 2014 reports and was not a reported theme in 2010. This is likely due to growing recognition for the need to address concerns from this particular stakeholder group. This recognition is further emphasized by the fact that in 2014 6 of the 13 reporting corporations reported on this theme; almost 50% of the industry. It is interesting to note that the "Water" theme experienced over a 100% increase in the number of indicators reported between 2010 and 2014. The increased emphasis of this
55

theme is further underlined by the increase in the number of corporations reporting, going from 7 reporting corporations in 2010 to 10 reporting corporations in 2014. The "Business Integrity" theme experienced the greatest drop over time in terms of the number of reported indicators, from 8 in 2010 to only 5 in 2014, a 38% decrease. However, when looking at the number of reporting corporations on this theme, the number remained constant at 4 corporations. Of those 4 corporations only 2 were the same for both reporting periods, Teck and BP. Table 19: # of Corporations Reporting by Theme - YoY Change
# of Themes Theme Land Health and Safety Water Financial Energy Emissions/Air Communities/Charitable Involvement Operations Business Integrity Employees Environmental Violations/Other Waste Aboriginals 2010 8 9 7 6 7 10 6 6 4 8 6 6 0 2014 12 13 10 8 9 12 7 7 4 8 5 4 6 Absolute Change YoY 4 4 3 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 -1 -2 N/A % Change YoY 50% 44% 43% 33% 29% 20% 17% 17% 0% 0% -17% -33%

A review of the data related to the number of corporations reporting on a theme again indicated that there was very little change over time. In 2010 the top three themes were "Emissions/Air", "Health and Safety", and "Employees" and "Land" (tied for the 3rd most common theme). In 2014 the top themes remained the same, although once again changed order to be "Health and Safety" with 13 corporations reporting, followed by "Land" and "Emissions/Air", both with 12 corporations reporting. Again this signifies not only consistency over time for these specific themes, but also demonstrates agreement and consistency across the corporations in this industry for reporting on these themes.
56

Finally, when looking at both the number of indicators per theme and the number of corporations reporting on a specific theme "Emissions/Air" and "Health and Safety" were in the top 3 for both time periods.

4.5 Indicators by Pillar This section looks at how indicators span the 3 pillars of sustainability: Social, Economic and Environmental. Once indicators were grouped into theme groups, each group was further divided into the pillars of sustainability. Table 20 shows each theme and its associated pillar. Table 20: Themes and Pillars
ENVIRONMENTAL Emissions/Air Energy Water Land Waste Environmental Violations/Other SOCIAL Communities/Charitable Involvement Business Integrity Employees Aboriginals Health and Safety ECONOMIC Financial Operations

4.5.1 2010 Reports Figure 9 shows the breakdown of indicators by pillar for the 2010 reporting period. Indicators associated with the environmental pillar made up 42% of the reported indicators. The social pillar of sustainability was almost equal at 40% of the reported indicators. Economic was the least represented pillar with only 18% of the reported indicators.

Figure 9: 2010 Indicators Reported by Pillar Upon reviewing the pillars based on the number of reporting corporations it is clear that the majority of reporting corporations covered each of the three pillars of sustainability in a broadly similar way. Every reporting corporation included indicators within the environmental pillar. All except 1 corporation, Shell Canada, reported an indicator in the social pillar of sustainability. Finally, all but 2 corporations, Shell Canada once again and Conoco Phillips, reported on an indicator covering the economic pillar of sustainability. Figure 10 shows a breakdown of reporting corporations by pillar for 2010.

The social pillar of sustainability was covered by all 13 corporations. Finally, the economic pillar was reported on by 10 of the 13 reporting corporations. Shell Canada, Conoco Phillips and Total did not report any indicators spanning the economic pillar. Figure 12 shows a breakdown of reporting corporations by pillar for 2014.

4.5.3 Indicators by Pillar - Year over Year Comparison This section looks at a year over year comparison of each pillar by both the number of reported indicators per pillar and the number of reporting corporations per pillar. The intent is to understand how reporting on each pillar has evolved over time. Table 21 and 22 show the year over year change in the number of indicators reported per pillar and the number of reporting corporations per pillar, respectively.

Table 21: # of Indicators by Pillar - YoY
Environmental Social Economic 2010 42% 40% 18% 2014 49% 37% 14% Change 7% -3% -4%

The environmental pillar remained the pillar with the greatest number of reported indicators for both time periods, but grew to include 7% more of the total indicators for the 2014 reporting period. Previously, the social and environmental pillar had been almost equally represented in terms of indicators reported. However, what is interesting about this trend is that while fewer of the reported indicators accounted for the social pillar in 2014, the number of corporations reporting grew from only 90% of reporting corporations, in 2010 to 100% in 2014. Further, while the environmental pillar accounted for more of the total reported indicators in 2014, the number of reporting corporations dropped from 100% to 92% or 12 of the reporting corporations. As previously mentioned, Devon Canada did not report any indicators across this pillar for 2014. However, the actual content of their report did cover this theme. For both time periods the economic pillar accounted for the fewest number of reported indicators with a year over year decline of 4%. A similar decline was seen with number of reporting corporations dropping from 80% to 77% in 2014. Table 22: # of Reporting Corporations by Pillar - YoY

Discussion and Conclusion

5.1 Discussion Our world today, more than ever before, is facing the ever growing challenge of balancing new ways of growing economies, while simultaneously decreasing the impact on the environment. There is more awareness today than ever before on the need to find new and innovate ways to manage our resources, and to minimize adverse environmental and social impacts. This growing awareness and concern globally has forced corporations, particularly those having visible impacts, to reassess how they are managing these impacts. A review of the literature clearly indicates that corporations have not only been forced to recognize the potential adverse consequence of their actions, but have now taken on accountability to a group of stakeholders much broader than just their shareholders (Freeman, 1984). Moreover, there is no doubt that corporations operating in the Canadian oil sand industry have both recognized and responded to this need. In 2010, 77% of the corporations studied produced a sustainability report. By 2014, the total had grown to 100%. However, while there seems to be agreement across the industry regarding the need to report, the results presented in chapter 4 show that there is very little alignment within the industry on what exactly they should be reporting and how.

5.1.1 Key Findings on Indicator Frequencies In both time periods, well over half of the indicators reported were only reported by 1 corporation. While there was a decrease in the number of indicators reported by 1 corporation only, from 81% in 2010 to 73% in 2014, it is still astounding. Furthermore, for both 2010 and 2014 there was not even one indicator that the industry unanimously reported on. Recordable injury frequency was the indicator reported by the most number of corporations in both time periods. For this indicator, the number of reporting corporations increased, from 80% in 2010 to 85% in 2014. However, even on this indicator there are issues with reporting consistency. Recall, indicators are intended to not only measure, but to also provide transparency around the progress a corporation is making toward achieving their goals (PwC, 2007). Keeble (2003) also outlined that indicators are intended to help stakeholders with understanding the impacts of a
61

corporation. However, understanding on the impacts of a corporation are limited if a stakeholder is not able to accurately benchmark the corporation against its peers. Consistency in the calculation and reporting of the indicators are critical in these regards. These findings line up with similar findings of inconsistency in reporting amongst corporations studied by Poveda (2015), Adams and Frost (2008), PWC (2009), and Roca and Searcy (2010). The lack of mandatory regulations around sustainability reporting as previously discussed in the literature review, might offer one explanation for the great range of reporting practices. These inconsistencies are further exacerbated by the apparent differences in the way corporations are presenting indicator data, which becomes evident when examining the sub categories associated with each of the indicators. For example, the differences in how a corporation reports the same indicator "Total" or "By Operation/Business Area" as demonstrated by the "Gas Flaring" example presented in section 3.4. While these inconsistencies make comparison challenging they can likely be explained by the diversity of each corporations operations beyond just the oil sands industry in Canada. 5.1.2 Key Findings on Indicator Themes The disconnect on indicator alignment across the industry is quite clear based on the research conducted and results presented. As such, the need for grouping indicators into themes was necessary in order to further investigate parallels and trends across the industry. As previously outlined, for the 2010 reporting period 12 themes emerged, with one additional theme emerging in 2014. In 2010, only 1 of the themes was reported on by all corporations. Of the remaining 11 themes, 10 of themes were reported on by more than half the corporations and only 1 theme had less than half the corporations reporting. In 2014, again only 1 theme was reported on by all corporations. Of the remaining 12 themes, 9 of them were reported on by more than half of the corporations. What is interesting to note is that the newly emerged theme in 2014, aboriginals, was one of the themes reported on by more than half the corporations. Searcy et al. (2008) found that Aboriginal issues were prominent when looking at key issues surrounding Canadian electric utilities. The findings of this research suggest the same is true for the Aboriginal stakeholder group as it relates to the Canadian oil sands industry.

62

While the theme level does not indicate total alignment across the industry, it does suggest similarities across corporations regarding the broad types of information they have determined is important to report on. This may be partially explained through the lens of institutional theory. When you look at the themes reported on by the greatest number of corporations over time, the most common themes remained the same, namely "emissions/air", "health and safety", "land" and "water". These, issues generally align with the issues the oil sands faces the most pressure on (Poveda, 2015). As Poveda (2015) explained, the oil sands are receiving worldwide attention for the potential social and environmental impacts they can be associated with. Regulatory and stakeholder pressure arising from this attention may be viewed as a form of coercive pressure as outline by DiMaggio and Powell (1983). DiMaggio and Powell (1983) also outlined mimetic mechanisms as a trigger for institutional isomorphic changes. The likelihood of this taking place in the industry is less clear through the results found. It is evident in some respects when you look at the growth in reporting corporations for most of the themes over time. Ten of the 12 themes present for both time periods experienced a growth in the number of reporting corporations over the 4 year period. This trend was consistent with the findings of Adams and Frost (2008) who found that corporations operating within the same industries tended to display similarities in the issues they placed focus on. DiMaggio and Powell (1983) outlined one final potential mechanism, normative. The presence of guidelines such as the GRI and professional organizations like COSIA who have outlined certain focus areas would lend to the idea of normative mechanisms being present. Specifically, 3 of the 4 main focus areas outlined by COSIA land, greenhouse gases and water (COSIA, 2016b) were also the same themes reported on by the greatest number of corporations. Further, trends in growth and the addition of the new aboriginal theme in 2014 would suggest some indication on stakeholder theory. Growth in certain categories could be the result of increased stakeholder attention. Note that stakeholder groups can include groups represented both internal to the corporation as well as external.

63

5.1.3 Key Findings on Indicator Pillars The greatest level of alignment across the industry becomes apparent when looking at the three pillars of the triple bottom line and how the indicators reported span these pillars. This is once again likely due to factors of institutional theory. For both time periods the environmental pillar by far represented the largest number of indicators reported and the largest number of reporting corporations, this was followed by the social pillar, again for both time periods. This trend can once again be linked back to coercive pressures. As outlined above, all 4 of themes reported by the greatest number of corporations, align with the areas Poveda (2015) outlined as receiving the most worldwide attention. Of these 4 themes, 3 fall into the environmental pillar, while the remaining themes can be categorized as falling into the social pillar. In producing these reports the individual corporations are seeking to achieve legitimacy and acceptance by environmental groups, surrounding communities and other stakeholder groups so that they can operate successfully as Hatch and Cunliffe (2013) outline. Adams and Frost (2008) noted that corporations operating in environmentally high impact industries placed a larger focus on indicators spanning the environmental theme. Adams and Frost (2008) also noted that the specific information being provided, even by corporations operating in the same industry and country, tended to be inconsistent. Not only a shocking conclusion, which is further enforced by the findings of this research, but also a conclusion which would reinforce the lesser impact that mimetic mechanisms may have played. Finally, the heavy weight placed on the environmental pillar would once again suggest that normative pressures may have played a role here. This is evident when you observe that the 4 key focus areas outlined by COSIA are all environment related (COSIA, 2016b). Further to note is that the three pillars in which each of these indicators was categorized suggests alignment with Gray and Milne (2002) who argue that sustainability reporting is too complex a process. Instead Gray and Milne (2002) suggest that what we see being produced by corporations today are "triple bottom line reports"; in other words they argue these reports examine each of the pillars separately as opposed to looking
64

at of each of them as they interact with each other. Often, these reports were broken out into distinct sections or indicators focusing on issues addressing only one of pillars at a time. There were few indicators that addressed the broader sustainability context in which the corporations operate.

5.2 Summary The central research question addressed in this study was "how consistently are companies operating in the Canadian oil sands industry both measuring and communicating their sustainability performance to stakeholders?" The three subquestions were: 1. What indicators are currently being reported by these corporations? 2. How consistent is reporting and indicator use across companies operating in the Canadian oil sands industry? 3. How has the use of indicators and the consistency of reporting across the industry evolved over time? In order to address these three questions a content analysis of sustainability or equivalent reports was conducted. Thirteen reports, produced by corporations representing 90% of oil sands production (COSIA, 2016c) were reviewed. In order to address the first question, "what indicators are currently being reported by these corporations?" a database of indicators was created for both 2010 and 2014. The database of indicators outlined both high level indicators and sub categories of indicators being reported by each corporation studied. These databases can be found in Appendix 3 and 4, for 2010 and 2014, respectively. The second question, "how consistent is reporting and indicator use across companies operating in the Canadian oil sands industry?" was addressed through categorizing the identified indicators into 13 different theme groups and then further into the 3 pillars of sustainability. This was necessary because of the vast and differing indicators presented by each corporation, which shed light on a lack of consistency across the
65

industry. Through categorizing the identified indicators into themes, and the subsequently into each pillar, it was found that the environmental pillar made up the largest representation of indicators. This was followed by the social pillar for both 2010 and 2014. Within each of the these pillars the most commonly reported themes were "emissions/air", "health and safety", "land" and "water". These remained the same for both time periods. The third question, "how has the use of indicators and the consistency of reporting across the industry evolved over time?" was addressed through a comparative analysis of the indicator databases, theme assignments and pillar assignments for both reporting periods, 2010 and 2014. The research conducted allowed for the creation of a database of 453 indicators broken into 272 high level indicators, and 528 indicators broken into 272 high level indicators, for 2010 and 2014, respectively. After analyzing each set of indicators and cross comparing it was evident that little change had occurred over time towards achieving a streamlined and consistent set of indicators across the industry. However, what was noted was the increase to 100% of corporations included in this study completing a report in 2014, up 23% from 2010. It was concluded that while there was a definite recognition and acceptance for the need of producing a sustainability report, extensive work still needs to be done to ensure that corporations across the industry are providing the same information in the same way so that it can be easily understood and interpreted by stakeholders.

5.3 Contributions The literature review took an extensive look into the information currently available with respect to sustainability reporting and indicators, particularly in the context of the Canadian oil sands industry. What was found was that, while there has been extensive work completed looking at sustainability reporting and sustainability indicators, little information was available specifically looking at the use of these tools and the evolution of these tools over time in the Canadian oil sands industry.

66

This research provided the first comprehensive database of indicators disclosed by corporations operating within this industry. This is important given the enormous economic, environmental and social impacts, both positive and negative, associated with this industry. Additionally, this research can act as a baseline for a number of potential streams of future research. The research documented critical issues surrounding the use of indicators in sustainability reporting across this industry. It outlined that, while the industry has recognized a need for producing a sustainability report and has taken steps to address this need, there is still progress to be made. As uncovered by this research, there is a great deal of diversity and inconsistency amongst the indicators each company has reported on. Also concerning, were the inconsistencies in the way these corporations reported indicators that they were seemingly aligned on. This research provides an understanding of the current state of sustainability reporting and indicator use across this industry and, as such, can help to spark a shift towards more consistent and streamlined reporting by each of these corporations. This shift can take place either through the implementation of consistent reporting requirements on a specific set of indicators across the industry or via widespread agreement and collaboration across the corporations operating in this industry to each use one of the already recognized set of voluntary guidelines available in a consistent way.

5.4 Limitations While the research conducted represents a comprehensive look into the use of indicators and sustainability reporting across the Canadian oil sands industry, some limitations have been identified. When looking at the sustainability reports produced by these companies, only pdf documents were included, and in some cases the summary report. As such, the study did not include information that each corporation may have included in other areas of their websites or their financial reports. Further, these reports generally covered the entirety of a corporations operation and as such pulling out oil sands specific indicators was not possible. A second limitation lies around the corporations included in this study. As outlined in the methods, COSIA member corporations were chosen as the corporations to be included in this study since they
67

make up 90% of oil sands production in Canada. Corporations accounting for the remaining 10% of production were not included. This study looked strictly at corporations working in Canada's oil sands industry and did not look at similar corporations operating in other types of oil production, or oil sands projects in other places of the world. Finally, the study relied solely on what the corporations chose to publicly share. It is possible additional indicators are used internally.

5.5 Recommendation for Future Research This research provides a basis for many streams of potential work in the future. First, a similar content analysis can be completed on corporations operating in other streams of oil production. For example, off shore or corporations making up the production of oil sands in other areas of the world, like Venezuela. This would allow for benchmarking across countries. A second potential stream of work could focus on reaching out to oil sands corporations either through the use of questionnaires or via interviews to understand how corporations determine what indicators to disclose in their sustainability reports. This work could provide a basis for understanding some of the recognized trends identified in the content analysis above. Finally, the most pressing piece of future research could focus around collaborating with oil sands corporations along with their key stakeholder groups to put together a proposal for a consistent set of sustainability indicators for the Canadian oil sands industry. This is by far the most critical piece of work which needs to take place in order to ensure that corporations operating in the industry are addressing and communicating information on the most pertinent issues facing the industry. One area of particular need is the development of indicators linked to the broader sustainability context in which the industry operates.

5.6 Conclusion The study showed little consistency in terms of which indicators are being reported by corporations operating in the Canadian oil sands industry. The study did demonstrate some consistency between the themes and pillars represented by the indicators. Reports are covering similar themes and almost all reporting corporations are spanning each pillar. As discussed, this may be due in part, to the institutionalization of reporting
68

in the industry. This can also be attributed to stakeholder theory, suggesting corporations are responding to the needs of their stakeholders, internal and external, by providing certain information. With respect to the themes and pillars, each corporation has recognized and responded to a need for communication on certain issues to stakeholders and have done so in a way similar to that of their peers. However, this does not extend to the individual indicators themselves. Not only do the indicators vary a great deal, but even for those indicators that are consistently being reported, the manner in which this is done varies widely. This makes any type of cross comparison among industry players and benchmarking nearly impossible. For a stakeholder trying to understand how these corporations measure up against one another, the information is difficult to decipher. It is clear that while there are voluntary tools available for corporations to use when reporting; the lack of comparability is impeding the ability of these reports to provide meaningful and actionable information for stakeholders. Based on the findings, and as previously outlined, the most pertinent area for future would be working with the industry to collaborate on a set of consistent indicators to be reported and measured in the same way. This would provide stakeholders with comparable information which can in turn create action towards mitigating adverse impacts.
