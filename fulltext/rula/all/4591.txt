Abstract: Conventional ice navigation in the sea is manually operated by well-trained navigators, whose experiences are heavily relied upon to guarantee the ship's safety. Despite the increasingly available ice data and information, little has been done to develop an automatic ice navigation support system to better guide ships in the sea. In this study, using the vector-formatted ice data and navigation codes in northern regions, we calculate ice numeral and divide sea area into two parts: continuous navigable area and the counterpart numerous separate unnavigable area. We generate Voronoi Diagrams for the obstacle areas and build a road network-like graph for connections in the sea. Based on such a network, we design and develop a geographic information system (GIS) package to automatically compute the safest-and-shortest routes for different types of ships between origin and destination (OD) pairs. A visibility tool, Isovist, is also implemented to help automatically identify safe navigable areas in emergency situations. The developed GIS package is shared online as an open source project called NavSpace, available for validation and extension, e.g., indoor navigation service. This work would promote the development of ice navigation support system and potentially enhance the safety of ice navigation in the Arctic sea. Keywords: sea ice; Arctic; navigation; GIS; Isovist

1. Introduction Navigation in the sea is quite different from the way we navigate on land through road networks. A road network includes fixed walkable or drivable connections to navigate with the help of navigation system and service. On the contrary, a navigable sea area is continuous and always changing due to variations of sea ice coverage over time. As a result, ice navigation requires great patience. Conventionally, navigation in the sea requires well-trained ice navigators to plan and handle ship routes between origin and destination (OD) in such areas where navigable conditions are constantly changing [1], whose experiences are heavily relied upon to guarantee the ship's safety. According to Transport Canada (1998) [2], at least one experienced ice navigator must be on-board while a polar ship navigates in the sea. The navigators consider many factors (e.g., ice condition and ship movement) and sometimes needs to change ship route and speed under unexpected situations [3]. However, the required skills of ice navigators are not expected to fully guarantee the safety of ships in that area. According to the statistics from [4], shipping accidents have occurred in the last decades. Despite advances in information and communications technology (ICT) to facilitate navigation, conventional ice navigation is somehow manually operated, especially for ship route planning. To provide safer ice navigation and better guide ships in the sea, an automatic ice navigation support system is desirable. Clearly, sea ice information plays a key role in the design and development of such a system. Researchers and practitioners have long realized the direct connection between spatio-temporal ice database models and ice information systems and services. Related ice studies in the past decades

have fallen into three groups: the first is to design spatio-temporal database models for storing and manipulating large-scale sea ice data for related studies [5­9]. The second focuses on using GIS and web tools to deliver ice information services such as online visualization and data access to end users (e.g., [10­13]). Meanwhile, a number of government agencies and research centers also provide online sea ice services and interoperable web services (e.g., [14­19]). The third is dedicated to sea ice related environmental issues such as identification of sea ice patterns (e.g., [20­22]). Despite numerous studies in ice database models and ice information system, policy-makers and ice navigators do not have tools to adequately visualize navigable sea areas and assist automatic ship navigation in real time, even if such ice data is available. The few studies that do consider sea ice navigation (e.g., [3,23,24]) are limited to the assessment and visualization of ice conditions and variation, not a practical and automatic ice navigation support system. Some existing marine navigation software tools (e.g., [25]) only focus on GIS visualization by overlaying multiple information layers such as seafloor, tide and ship location. This study fills that research gap by proposing a novel GIS methodology that aims to develop an automatic ice navigation support system. We propose a virtual road-like-graph in the sea that is built based on the delineation of navigable sea areas and unnavigable sea ice regimes or obstacles. We apply the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm and adopt the visual analytical Isovist method, and then we develop an integrated analytical GIS package, which we call NavSpace. NavSpace is an open source GIS project that is available for extension and validation in related ice studies. By applying the NavSpace to GIS vector-formatted ice data from the Canadian Ice Service, we demonstrate how the GIS-based ice navigation support system allows us to: (1) assist automatic ship route planning; (2) automatically identify navigable sea areas in case that emergency situations may begin to occur; and (3) interactively map for the purpose of higher visual and analytical navigation services. As a result, an automatic ice navigation support system may be achieved in real time at an operational level. The study is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our proposed GIS-based methodology, including the delineation of navigable sea areas and generation of Voronoi Diagrams for unnavigable ice regimes, followed by the description of the ship routing algorithm and the visualization method Isovist. Section 3 presents some implementation results using digital sea ice charts from the Canadian Ice Service. Section 4 offers some concluding remarks. 2. Methodology The main objective of this study is to develop integrated analytical GIS-based tools to support ship route planning, visualization and navigation services, so that the potential for improving sea ice navigation safety may be achieved. This section illustrates in detail our proposed GIS-based methodology by using artificial data for the sake of convenience. 2.1. A GIS-Based Two-Stage Solution A GIS-based two-stage solution is proposed to this problem (Figure 1). First, it is straightforward to divide navigable sea areas and unnavigable sea areas based on the calculation of ice numeral (IN) of vector-formatted digital sea ice data. The IN serves as an indicator of whether or not it is safe for a type of ship to enter a sea ice area, which means we are able to divide sea areas into two parts: navigable sea areas and unnavigable sea areas. The calculation of IN will be discussed in detail in Section 2.2. Second, the generation of skeleton for navigable sea areas is a process that discretizes a continuous open space into many individual lines or segments. The skeleton lines can be used to create a road-network-like graph, based on which we can apply any route planning algorithm to assist navigation in the sea. The generation of Voronoi Diagrams for ship routing will be discussed in Section 2.3. We implement this GIS-based two-stage solution as a GIS package and prove that the generated ship routes are not only in consistent with the recommended routes, but also the shortest-and-safest routes. The main advantage of this method is that such a simple and elegant ship routing method can provide the safest option.

where Ca is the concentration in tenths of ice type a, and IMa is the ice multiplier (IM) for ice type a, and the rest can be done in the same manner. IMs are used to indicate how much weight can be given to an ice type for a type of ship (see Table 1).

If the ice numeral calculated for a type of ship is zero or positive, the ship can navigate through that ice regime. Conversely, if the ice numeral is negative, this type of ship cannot navigate through that ice regime unless an alternative plan such as using ice breaker to assist the ship is to be adopted. For example, suppose that an ice regime consists of 8/10ths total ice concentration, of which 1/10th is old ice and 7/10ths is thick first-year ice. While doing the calculation, remember to incorporate the 2/10ths open water [27]: Type A ship : p1 ^ ´4q ` p7 ^ ´1q ` p2 ^ 2q " ´7 pNegative regimeq CAC 4 ship : p1 ^ ´3q ` p7 ^ ` 1q ` p2 ^ 2q " `8 pPositive regimeq (2) (3)

The calculated INs reflect how they fluctuate for the same ice with structurally different ships. In the above example, Type A ship cannot navigate through the ice regime, while Type CAC4 ship can navigate it through safely. In this way, we are able to delineate navigable sea areas for different types of ships by using GIS vector-formatted digital ice charts. 2.3. Generating Voronoi Diagrams for Ship Route Planning When navigating in the sea, ice navigators must be aware of where, what type and how much of ice regime is around them. Theoretically, ships can navigate at any location in positive regimes. However, to select the safest ship route, the best strategy is to keep them as far as possible from the negative regimes with high concentration [27]. In Figure 3, there are 14 artificial obstacles in black that are unnavigable sea areas, and the minimum bounding rectangle is used to describe their boundaries. We generate Voronoi Diagrams for these 14 obstacles, which are colored areas in Figure 3a. Based on the mathematical definition of a Voronoi Diagram, the distance between each point within a Voronoi Diagram and the obstacles is shorter than the distance between the point and any other obstacles. As a result, the boundary (blue lines in Figure 3b), which we call skeleton, of a Voronoi Diagram is the bisector of the space between any two obstacles, and any point on the boundary has the farthest distances to all the closest obstacles at the same time. Because of this, skeletons fully comply with the safest navigate principle in the sea.

Noticeably, according to [27], it is also important that the ships should navigate along the Noticeably, according to [27], it is also important that the ships should navigate along the coastlines coastlines as much as possible in the sea. To solve this problem, a weighted shortest path algorithm as much as possible in the sea. To solve this problem, a weighted shortest path algorithm is developed is developed in NavSpace. In weighted shortest path algorithm, rather than using the geometric in NavSpace. In weighted shortest path algorithm, rather than using the geometric length of each length of each skeleton, we use weight of each skeleton line to calculate shortest route. The weight is skeleton, we use weight of each skeleton line to calculate shortest route. The weight is calculated in the calculated in the following way: we simply calculate the closest distance between each skeleton line following way: we simply calculate the closest distance between each line segment and segment and coast line, and the weight to each skeleton line is justskeleton in inverse proportion to coast such line, and the weight to each skeleton is just inverse proportion to suchthe normalized distance. normalized distance. It means that theline closer the in skeleton line is to coast lines, higher the weight It means that the closer the skeleton line is to coast lines, the higher the calculate weight ofthe theshortest skeletonpath line of the skeleton line segment has, and vice versa . After that, when we segment has, and vice versa . After that, when we calculate the shortest path between OD pairs, we also between OD pairs, we also obtain the weight of each possible path. To satisfy the above two obtain the weight of each possible path. To select satisfysuch the above two navigation safety regulations, navigation safety regulations, we can just a path that has the highest weight and we its

4. Conclusions In this study, we make several important new contributions to the literature on automatic ice navigation support service in a time-geographic context. From a methodological perspective, we formalize algorithms for automatic ship routing and visual analysis based on ice numeral, and develop an analytical GIS package. It is available as an open source tool (link available for downloading at [31]) for validation and extension. This easy-to-use ArcGIS tool is also useful for interested readers in relevant research, for example, indoor navigation study. The methodology is demonstrated using the Canadian Ice Service Archive data. A number of future studies can be conducted. We have demonstrated the capacity to automatically navigate in the sea in real time and implemented it in an open source GIS package. An online version with a real-time dashboard is to be designed for sea ice navigation agency by integrating live data feeds and other types of real-time sea events for managing operations, which will offer researchers new insights in real-time sea ice navigation support. As for the validation of the methods and results, especially using real ship routes, it will be our future work as long as we have access to real navigation data.
