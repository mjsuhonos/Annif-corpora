IMPLEMENTATION OF PREISACH-KRASNOSELSKII HYSTERESIS MODEL WITH THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS

ABSTRACT

Accurate modeling of hysteresis is essential for both the design and performance evaluation of electromagnetic devices. This project proposes the use of feedforward neural networks to implement an accurate magnetic hysteresis model based on the mathematical definition provided by the Preisach-Krasnoselskii (P-K) model. Feedforward neural networks are a linear association networks that relate the output patterns to input patterns. By introducing the multi-layer feedforward neural networks to Hysteresis modeling, the proposed multi-layer perceptron neural network and radial basis function neural network both are capable of modeling hysteresis accurately. The feedforward neural networks make the hysteresis modeling accurate without estimation of double integrals. Simulation results provide the detailed illustrations. The comparisons with the experiments show that the proposed approach is able to satisfactorily reproduce many features of observed hysteresis phenomena and in turn can be used for many applications of interest.

INTRODUCTION
1. Introduction

1.1. M otivation

The accurate and effective modeling o f hysteresis is crucial to the prediction o f the perform ance o f electromagnetic devices. Ferro-magnets, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt etc, will tend to stay magnetized to some extent after being subjected to an external magnetic field; this tendency to "rem em ber their m agnetic history" is called hysteresis.

M agnetic materials are usually described in terms o f a single valued B-H curve (magnetic flux density - magnetic field) in finite element analysis.

The industrial applications range from modeling o f recording heads, to m odeling the behavior o f magnetic cores, a single-valued B-H curve m ay adequately characterize the magnetic material. In many instances, it is im portant to have a good model o f hysteresis in order for the core loss to be accurately predicted since hysteresis loss can be a significant component o f the total loss.

In m any electronic devices, such as motors and generators, the behavior o f the device is strongly influenced by the behavior o f the magnetic com ponents (e.g. inductors, transformers). Hysteresis then can have a powerful influence on both

devices perform ance and losses. The use o f phenomenological mathematical m odels of hysteresis is a well-established approach for describing

m agnetization phenomena. [1] A typical example o f such models is the classical Preisach model that is a scalar model o f magnetic hysteresis based on the physical mechanisms o f magnetization. [2] Attempts to separate the physical meaning o f magnetism from the Preisach model have resulted in the Preisach-Krasnoselskii model. [3] The P-K model is a mathematical tool that can be used for the mathematical description o f hysteresis o f any physical nature. This purely mathematical model takes a macroscopic point o f view to hysteresis phenomena and provides no insights into the physical causes o f hysteresis. Owing to this characteristic, the P-K model becomes a very pow erful and effective tool for designing devices with hysteresis features.

Recently, artificial neural networks have been widely used to model a wide range o f systems for which mathematical models either cannot be defined, or are ill defined. It has been successfully used in those applications involving pattern matching [4] and systems modeling [5]. This success was the main m otivation behind some attempts to utilize ANNs in the area o f magnetic hysteresis. Innovative techniques for the accurate modeling o f hysteresis phenom ena will have very important practical significance.

1.2. Feasibility

This project proposes the use o f artificial neural networks as functional approximation tools with local memory capabilities that will be suitable for the construction o f a P-K model. The exploration o f the working hypothesis in this po q ect is that both P-K model and the ANN model have local mem ory, and

both

exhibit

fault

tolerance

capabilities.

Furthermore,

they

both

are

m athem atical tools, which take a macroscopic approach to the problem.

Specifically, this paper considers the applications o f multi-layer perceptron (M LP) and radial basis function (RBF) networks that are already proven to be universal approximators, and will show that there is a natural correlation between; (i) the coefficients o f the P-K model and the connection weights in A N N m odel and, (ii) the Preisach operators and A N N 's activation functions. In this respect, this project treats the magnetic hysteresis system as a black box and the mathematical tools as means for the identification o f the unknown input/output relation governing the system.

1.3. Summary

In summary, P-K model research can bring up alternative mathematical tools to ensure the accurate and effective modeling of hysteresis.

In this research paper, a review o f P-K model and neural networks in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 will uncover that multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function netw orks as universal approximators can be used to reconstruct the P-K model. N ext, m y new MLP and RBF neural network implementations using Square Perm alloy 80 at different frequencies including DC, 1 kHz, 3 kHz, and 6 kHz w ill be described in detail followed by modeling and analysis o f the im plem entations in Chapter 4. The simulation experiments are also provided for illustration purposes. Finally, the conclusion section will show the research contributions o f this work by presenting a new m ethodology for accurate and effective modeling o f hysteresis.

HYSTERESIS & PREISACH-KRASNOSELSKII MODEL
2 Hysteresis & Preisach-Krasnoselskii Model

2.1. Hysteresis

The process o f magnetic hysteresis is basically a sequence o f Barkhausen jum p. The Barkhausen effect consists o f discontinuous changes in flux density during sm oothly changing magnetic field. They are known as Barkhausen jum ps and are caused by the sudden irreversible motion o f magnetic domain walls as they break away from pinning sites.

W hen we detect a jum p, the system is leaving a metastable state in favor o f some other state o f lower energy. Two energy terms are involved in the event, the free energy change AF from the initial state to the final state and the amount o f energy AE dissipated as heat during the jump. If we can keep track o f the energy changes while the jump sequence proceeds, we would have at hand quite a general description o f hysteresis. The main difficulty behind this picture is that we do not know the general principles controlling the statistics of Barkhausen jum p and those determining in what proportion the work performed by external sources is subdivided into stored and dissipated energy in the jum p sequence. This brought to us F. Preisach; the German physicist gave the idea o f describing a generic hysteresis system as the superposition o f m any bistable units and gave this idea an elegant and illuminating graphical representation.

In the 1970 s, the Russian mathematician Krasnoselskii came across Preisach*s m odel and understood that it contained a new general mathematical idea. As a result, a new mathematical model was revealed which can be used for the m athem atical description o f hysteresis o f any physical nature.

2.2.

The Preisach Approach

W e shall first discuss how the Preisach approach fits in with the general interpretation o f the magnetization process as a sequence o f Barkhausen instabilities, and on this basis we shall introduce the Preisach-Krasnoselskii M odel. 2.2.1. Preisach Units The simplest energy profile giving a clear representation o f a Barkhausen instability is shown in Fig 2.1. The term preisach unit is. refers to a system characterized by an energy profile of this kind. The state variable m represents some characteristic magnetic moment involved in the problem, to be identified case by case. The system is confined to the interval - Am < m < -I-Am (Am > 0 ). The free energy o f the unit, F^(m) is determined by its values at the points - Am,0,4-Am . It is convenient to express these values in the form -//oA^Am,//oA^Am,/^oA^Am, where and are appropriate fields. The three

points are connected by straight segments, which give the two characteristic energy gradients, A ^ --A ^ for m > 0, and A ^ -i- A ^ for m < 0 . At last, we assume that the unit is coupled linearly to the magnetic field H , in the sense that the stability o f the unit is controlled by the Gibbs energy Gp(m;H) = F' p (w)-/^oH^« (2-1)

The presence o f the field gives rise to a Gp profile o f the same form as the Fp one, w ith --H ) in the place o f (see Fig 2.1). Other more realistic energy

profiles m ight be considered, the distinctive features o f the description are provided as: i. The position, ± Atn , o f the two energy minima is independent of the field H ; ii.The height o f the energy barriers separating the two minima depends linearly on H. Depend on the relative values of A,,,A^,and H, G p{m-,H) may exhibit one or two local minima. When H >h^ + , only one minima exists, at m = +Am . is a minima. In the

Analogously, when H < h ^ - h ^ , only m = - A m interm ediate case, - h ^ < H <h^ +

, two minima, one stable and one

m etastable, exist if A ^ > 0. We will not consider the case A ^ < 0 , because the potential then has one minimum under any arbitrary field, and the unit exhibits a reversible response to the field, which can be separately treated with no difficulty. The stability condition just listed can be expressed in graphical form w ith axes A ^ and A,,. A given Preisach unit is identified by the representative point o f coordinates (A^,AJ in this plane; Let us subdivide the half-plane A ^ > 0 into the three regions show in Fig 2.2. The boundary o f region II is the bifurcation set where Barkhausen jum ps may occur.

Fig 2.3 the Square Hysteresis Loop

The energy representation given in Fig 2.1 shows that, when a Barkhausen ju m p occurs, the energy G^(m ;H) suddenly decreases by If^Jn^b^n . This is the amount o f energy dissipated as heat in the jump. At the same time the free energy F^{m) changes by the amount and at the jump. We see that

energy. In subsequent sections, we sometimes use the square loop switching fields,

In the next section, the starting point o f the Preisach model is usually the idea that a system should be described by a collection o f elementary square loops o f the kind shown in Fig 2.3. This is mathematically appropriate because the

elem entary loops are actually a pictorial representation o f elementary hysteresis operators that can be superposed, to build up hysteresis nonlinearities w ith a m ore complex structure. The basic physical aspect o f the approach is to introduce the two variables, dissipated energy. and , describing stored energy versus

2.3.

The Preisach-Krasnoselskii Model

The phenom enon o f hysteresis is encountered in many areas o f science. But the interpretation o f hysteresis differs from one area to another and from paper to paper. This led us to rigorous mathematical definitions o f hysteresis in order to avoid confusion and ambiguity. The definition provided in [3] is o f particular interest. According to this definition, a function is called a static hysteresis function if its input-output relationship is a multi-branch non-linearity for w hich a branch-to-branch transition occurs after each input reaches a minimum or m axim um (Fig 2.4). The term "static" implies that branches o f hysteresis are determ ined by the past extremum values o f the inputs, while the speed o f input variation between extremum values have no influence on branching. This definition highlights two key attributes of the hysteresis phenomenon. One is that hysteresis behaves sequentially and can be specified by following a predeterm ined sequence o f states which the output is a function o f input and internal states. Another is that hysteresis is inevitably associated with memory.

The P-K model can be used as a mathematical tool to represent description o f m agnetic hysteresis [1]. This model can be represented by using a finite set o f hysteresis binary operators, f^p (with a and (3 corresponding to up and down sw itching values o f the inputs), serves as a local memory (Fig 2.5).

to be determ ined from some experimental data. The geometric interpretation o f model (2.3) is based on the fact that there is one-to-one relationship between operator y^p and points (cr,/ 7) o f the h alf plane a > P . Using this fact, it can be concluded that at any time the triangle T is subdivided into two sets (Figure 2.6). w hich y^pH(t) = \ and S~{t) consists {t) consists o f points (a ,/7 )fo r of points {a,p) for which

y^pH(t) = - \ . It can be shown that the interface L{t) between S* {t) and S~{t) is a staircase line whose vertices have a and p coordinates coinciding w ith local m axim a and minima of input at a previous time. The final link o f L{t) is attached to the line a = P and moves when the input changes. W hen the inputs increase, this link is a horizontal one and moves up, and it is a vertical one, and moves from right to left when the input decreases.

U sing this interpretation, the model (2.3) can be presented as:

^ (0 =

P)H{t)dadp -

P)H {t)dadp,

(2.4)

From the expression (2.4), it follows that an instantaneous value o f output depends on the shapes o f the interface T (t), which is determined by the extreme values o f input at previous instants of time. As a result, the past extremum value o f inputs shape the interface Z,(t), and with which they leave their mark upon the future.

The unknowns o f this model may be systematically found using f-o reversal curves (Fig 2.7). This can only lead to good prediction results. This can be done by first bringing the input value to states such that the outputs o f all operators 7ap equal to -1. If we now gradually increase the input value, it will follow will be used for

Summary

The P-K model above is shown to satisfy the formal definition o f hysteresis provided. First, the P-K model uses the binary units to form the local memory capability. Secondly, it is shown, that this model stores information not in particular separate units, but some groups o f the units which together keep each piece o f information related to hysteresis. As a result, if some o f the units are destroyed, the stored information still might be preserved [1]. This, so called,

fault tolerance property is similar to that o f the memories in biological systems, and to the memory capability o f an ANN,

Neural Networks Structure

Artificial Neural networks, commonly known as "neural networks", can be defined as a model o f reasoning inspired by biological neural interaction in the natural world. The human brain consists of a densely interconnected set o f nerve cells, neurons. Similarly, a neural network is a computer system made up o f a num ber o f very simple and highly interconnected processors, also called neurons, that process information in parallel by that dynamic state response to external inputs [5].

A neuron is the basic information-processing unit o f a neural network. A neuron k , from input to output can be described using the following two equations:

This model is a simple, yet useful, approximation o f a biological neuron and can be used to develop different neural structures including feedforward networks. A typical network consists o f an input layer, one or more hidden layer and an output layer o f neurons. A multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer is shown in Fig 3.2.

The neurons o f one or more hidden layers o f MLPs are not part o f the input/output o f the networks. These hidden neurons provide the learning capability for the networks.

Error-correction Learning Law

To derive the error-correction learning law, let us consider the three-layer netw ork shown in Fig 3.3. The indices i, j and k refer to neurons in the input, hidden and output layers, respectively. Input signals, are propagated through the network from the left to

right, and error signals, e ,,e 2 ,...,e,,from right to left. The symbol Wy denotes the weight for the connection between neuron i in the input layer and neuron j in the hidden layer, and the symbol W j^. the weight between neuron j in the hidden layer and neuron k in the output layer.

To propagate error signals, we start at the output layer and work backward to the hidden layer. The error signal at the output o f neuron k is defined as:

This can be achieved by employing the method o f gradient descent, also known as the steepest descent method. We can adjust the weight values as following :

Error Back-propagation Training

The best known supervised learning algorithm. The learning algorithm was first developed by Werbos [5] and latter rediscovered by Rumelhart et al. [ 8 ]. The learning is done on the basis o f direct comparison o f the output o f the network w ith know n correct answers. The back propagation algorithm is an efficient

3.4. Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks

A m ulti-layer perceptron network (ML?) represents a class o f feedforword neural networks that contain one input layer with one output layer, together representing the system inputs and outputs, respectively, and one or more hidden layers providing the learning capability for the network [7](Fig 3.7). The basic element o f a M L? network is an artificial neuron whose activation function, for the hidden layer, is a smooth, differentiable function (usually sigmoid). The neurons in the output layer have a linear activation function. The back-propagation algorithms based on error-correction learning rule can be considered as an extension o f the "mean least square" algorithms [10]. This learning algorithm works by continuously presenting batches o f input vectors and their associated desired outputs and then iteratively changing the values of the network weights and biases in the direction of the steepest decent with respect to the relative error. One way of determining when to stop is the average error over the entire training set reaches a defined error or any other convergence criterion. A MLP network function can be formulated as:

3.5. Radial Basis Function Neural networks

In general, Radial basis function (RBF) network exhibits similar properties as M LP networks, such as generalization ability, fault tolerance and robustness. It therefore can be treated as an alternative tool for learning in neural networks.

34

RBF networks also have a fast learning capability comparing with other feedforward neural networks [9], The architecture o f the RBF network is sim ilar to a MLP network and consists of a fully connected two-layer network; the hidden layer and the output layer. The hidden layer is a collection o f neurons with radial basis activation functions, typically one of "Thin Plate Spline", Gaussian, Multi-Quadratic or Inverse Multi-Quadratic functions [9]. There are two parameters, the center c and the width, r , work with RBF neurons. They are similar to the weights and biases o f the hidden layer in a M LP network. The output layer is just an "adder" that sums a weighted inputs using the output connection weight, w , that represent the strength o f these connections (Fig 3.8) A RBF network function can be formulated as:

Summary

A ccording to the review, a neural network is massively parallel & distributed processor that works in a fashion similar to the human brain. It resembles a biological brain in two respects; first, the knowledge is acquired through a learning process, & second, inter-neuron connection strengths known as w eights are used to store the knowledge. The learning process involves m odification o f the connection weights to obtain a desired objective. Two kinds

36

o f neural networks that we specifically mentioned are MLP and RBF networks. They are all feedforward neural networks. Feedforward networks can be considered as linear association networks that relate output patterns to input patterns. Among the advantage of feedforward neural networks, the following features are especially important to the proposed implementation of Hysteresis phenom enon: 1) function approximation (I/O mapping): nonlinear function to the desired degree 2) Learning and generalization: ability to learn I/O patterns, extract the hidden relationship among presented data, & provide acceptable response to new data that the network has not yet experienced. 3) Fault tolerance: due to their highly parallel/distributed structure, failure o f a num ber o f neurons to generate the correct response does not necessarily lead to failure o f the overall performance of the system. ability to approximate any

RECONSTRUCTION OF P-K HYSTERESIS MODEL
4 Reconstruction o f P-K Hysteresis Model

In this paper, two major kinds o f neural network architectures, namely multiLayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks, are proposed to model the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). The reconstruction o f the PK M odel is achieved using the normalized data representing the hysteresis loops for Square Permalloy 80 at different frequency including DC, 1 kHz, 3 kHz, and 6 kHz. Square Permalloy 80 is materials consists of 80/20 alloy o f nickel and iron that can be easily magnetized and demagnetized. The perform ance criteria by which neural network-based models can usually be m easured including the training time, number of epochs, size of the network and accuracy. The first three criteria measurements are straightforward except the accuracy. In order to investigate the accuracy of implemented neural networks, comparisons between experimental data and the output o f the netw orks are made. The error index used for the comparison is non-dimensional index error (NDIE) that is the mean square error (MSB) o f hysteresis modeling norm alized by the standard deviation of the experimental data.

The dim ension o f the input vector and output vector is 1. The numbers of hidden layer neurons will vary. The corresponding simulation software program is coded in Matlab 6.5. The computer system used for the implementation is Pentium ® 4 CPU 2.4 GHz, 512 MB of RAM.

The configuration o f the hysteresis MLP is controlled by a script file. The configuration script file controls the parameters such as the dimension o f the input and output vectors, the dimension of the hidden layer, the learning stop condition and learning rate etc. The activation function is a sigmoid function. The training algorithm is the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm that was designed to approach second-order training speed without having to compute the Hessian m atrix [17]. The weight and bias are all set to an identical initial value before

39

training. A t the same time the inputs are normalized to between 0 and 1 so that the neural network will be sensitive to the input pattern.

The M LP network implementation is the matter o f finding the following m atching factors that attributed to failure in learning: 1) adequate numbers o f training cases; 2) sufficient numbers o f hidden neurons; 3) non-deterministic relationships between inputs and outputs. The second one is o f particular interest in the simulation.

The EAF sample used for simulation experiments is illustrated as Figure 4.1.

The RBF network implementation is a matter of finding the proper radial basis function and the appropriate learning algorithm. It has been shown theoretically and practically, that the performance of the RBF network does not depend on the choice o f the function [8] and hence, Gaussian functions are usually chosen. Therefore, the learning problem is to select adequate number o f RBF neurons, funetion centres and widths. In this paper, the learning was implemented using the orthogonal least squares algorithm that provides a systematic approach to the selection o f RBF centres while using forward regression procedure [10].

CONCLUSION

In the project, the source o f the problem is to consider the potential possibility o f applying neural networks for the reconstruction o f P-K based hysteresis phenomena. The review o f both P-K based hysteresis and neural networks demonstrates the feasibility o f modeling P-K based hysteresis using neural networks. T h e contribution of this project is to provide an interpretation of the Preisch-Krasnoselskii model that can be readily implemented by means of neural network methodology. The analysis of the simulation shows that the num ber o f hidden layer neurons plays an important role in the design. It directly effects the training time and accuracy of the modeling. The results o f the simulation show that MLP and RBF neural networks are both capable o f m odeling P-K based hysteresis phenomena.

In summary, based on the formal definition of the P-K based hysteresis provided, the P-K based hysteresis model has several similarities shared with artificial neural network characteristics for reconstruction of P-K model. First o f all, the proposed MLP and RBF neural networks both have ability to approximate any nonlinear function to the desired degree, to learn I/O patterns, extract the hidden relationship among presented data, and provide acceptable response to new data that the network has not yet experienced. This enables neural networks to provide models based on imprecise information. Secondly, they both have local memory, and due to their highly parallel/distributed

56

structure, failure o f a number o f neurons to generate the correct response does not lead to failure o f the overall performance o f the system. In fact there are m any magnetic field applications that will consider the proposed neural netw ork practical. Every time the design of electronic devices is applied, the proposed neural networks could be helpful. Further research work about applying different type of artificial neural networks in the magnetic related fields will provide more valuable information for the design o f electronic devices with hysteresis features. Furthermore, we can consider the following approach; 1) 2) Add noise to the validation data set as the training set remains unchanged. Use Leave-one-out (Jack-Knife) method in the training and validation.
