This book is very aptly named, for it was Alan Plaunt, more than any other individual, who set the philosophical and organizational foundations of the CBC and its progenitor, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission.
Plaunt's pivotal role in the genesis of public broadcasting in Canada was initially set out by Michael Nolan as his doctoral study for the University of Western Ontario where today Nolan teaches at the Graduate School of Journalism. CBC Enterprises published Nolan's work along with several other books in the fall of 1986 in celebration of CBC's 50 years of public broadcasting service. The 162 page narrative is enhanced by its thorough footnoting and seven pages of reference sources on Canadian broadcasting history.
