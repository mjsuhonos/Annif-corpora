On April 15th, 1989, at the F.A. (Football Association) Cup semi-final football match, Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield (U.K.), ninety-six men, women and children were crushed to death. Now known as the Hillsborough Disaster, this event is the worst sporting disaster in the history of England. My twenty-one year old brother, Thomas Steven Fox, was one of those ninety-six victims.

New inquests into the deaths of the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster opened in 2014. My documentary film, “Our Steve” is a forensic look at the inquest into my brother’s death in an attempt to document this process as it was happening. As the new inquests into Hillsborough re-entered the public sphere through media, television and political platforms, my need to represent this story and that of my family became the impetus for this project
