    The following thesis will explore the contemporary meaning of ‘Place’ and the lost relationship between human sensitivity -both emotional and physical- and the setting, which together would form the very definition of a place, and will make an attempt to re-define this relationship. By returning to the basic definition of place, this paper emphasizes the fact that place without memory is simply space without meaning and that unlike places of our time that put little emphasis on the embodied memory, memory of place is experienced through not only mind but also the entire body.
    The paper will take a bottom-up approach where ‘Space’ as a fundamental element of ‘Place’ and its transformation to place is discussed. There will be a comprehensive discussion on place itself and the role and ability of embodied memory in creation of place. Each section will make an effort to consider the current circumstances of ‘Place’ and how they might be transformed to establish a relationship between embodied memory of space and the physical location. Here, senses, movement and basic orientation of the body will be discussed as elements empowering the embodied memory and having the ability to transform spaces–or non-places- of our time into place.
    Movement if not one of our five senses, inspires us to engage our whole body; we see, touch and smell what surrounds us, and also understand the setting in the sense that we engage or interact with it. The design project will explore the act of movement as the fundamental element of forming embodied memory of ‘Space’ and transforming it into ‘Place’. Element of path, which links two significant nodes - one known as a place and another a non-place- will be incorporated to represent the act of movement and its impact on creation of a ‘Place’.
