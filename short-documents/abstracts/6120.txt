Downtown vitality has become an important planning issue as commercial retail evolves, development continues to sprawl, and global economic restructuring impacts North American economies. This paper reviews the literature on downtown revitalization and examines the process behind municipal planning led downtown revitalization and vitality retention approaches. Case studies of Brockville and Oakville, Ontario are used to understand a regulatory approach, in the form of a downtown strategic review. In-person interviews with municipal and community officials were undertaken to gain insight into the process of these two initiatives. While both of the approaches have positive aspects, a combination of the two is identified as most favorable in addressing downtown vitality.
