The mobile device industry has changed dramatically over the last 10 years. The world is swiftly adopting mobile devices, and Apple and Google have become major players in an industry that now encompasses a burgeoning mobile-fashion marketing business. This research project sought to help apparel retailers understand more about apparel consumersâ€™ usage of mobile devices and perceptions of mobile marketing strategies, and to shed light on better business practices. The study used a quantitative research method, along with cross-sectional, descriptive, and non-probabilistic sampling techniques. An online questionnaire survey was designed to collect data with a sample of 390 mobile device users in the Greater Toronto Area. SPSS was used for coding and analyzing the information.
