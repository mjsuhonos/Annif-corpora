Ciprofloxacin is a fully synthetic antibiotic developed in 1987 and remains among the
most widely used antibiotics worldwide
Excessive usage has resulted in small quinolone concentrations found in aquatic sources 
Environments with subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations and high microbial diversity
and nutrient loads (e g wastewater) foster the development of antibiotic resistance
genes 
qnr genes conferring quinolone resistance were first found in 1998 and have since been
observed on a global scale
