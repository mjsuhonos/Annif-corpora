The purpose of this poster is to provide insight into the processes involved in making a unique fashion research and teaching collection discoverable in an online environment at Ryerson University. The online collection will provide a means for the users to identify what artifacts are available for research purposes and facilitate teaching in the classroom. The poster will highlight effective metadata standards and elements, cross-domain metadata uses, metadata mapping and implementation.
