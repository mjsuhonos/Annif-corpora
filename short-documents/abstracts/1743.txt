    Energy efficient operation is a critical issue that has to be addressed with large-scale wireless sensor networks deployments. Cluster-based protocols are developed to tackle this problem and Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is one of the best-known protocols of this type. However, certain aspects of LEACH offer room for improvement. One such aspect is the arrangement of wireless sensor network with the fixed base station location. In this thesis we purpose Fuzzy Logic for Mobile Base Station (FLMBS) protocol that is based on LEACH but uses a Fuzzy Inference System driven approach to adjust the location of the base station. FLMBS produces reasonable improvement over LEACH in a network area greater than 1000 x 1000 m2. We also compare FLMBS to another protocol that uses Particle Swarm Optimization in order to find the location of base station. PSO outperforms FLMBS in 1000 x 1000 m2 but the difference is marginal, especially considering the larger complexity of PSO compared to FLMBS.
