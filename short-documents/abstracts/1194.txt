    This paper investigates employment experiences faced by 8 Japanese immigrant professionals in the Greater Toronto Area, including 3 Japanese-educated professionals, 3 both Japanese and Canadian-educated professionals, and 2 exclusively Canadian-educated professionals. This study attempts to examine whether Japanese credentials are recognized in licensing and hiring processes, and whether Canadian education improves the employment experience among Japanese immigrant professionals. In the case of the Japanese immigrant professionals in this study, barriers to licensing they experienced differ from profession to profession. Despite licenses, participants also experienced barriers to employment in their professions even if they were Canadian-educated, Japanese professionals. Except in one case, it appears that obtaining Canadian degrees in their professions facilitated practicing their professions in the mainstream labour market. Most of the participants were also benefited by some form of Canadian education in addition to their professional knowledge.
