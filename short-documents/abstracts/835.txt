    Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is three-dimensional imaging technique, capable of producing high resolution cross-sectional images through homogeneous samples, such as biological tissue. Real-time acquisition rates are a significant advantage in OCT. However, when images are generated by first acquiring data and then postprocessed on PC to extract information this advantage is cancelled out.
    In this project a system which can provide estimation of pixel values for three imaging modes: Structural, Color-flow Doppler and Velocity Variance is designed. The proposed system is standalone data processor using FPGA. The system was designed to process recorded data for verification purposes; however, it can be easily modified to process real-time data. Since the system has three modes of visualization it can be used for detecting in vivo blood flow. The proposed system was completed at MATLAB, Xilinx System Generator (XSG) and VHDL levels and the results show consistency between theoretical results, MATLAB, XSG and VHDL.
