In a digital age, we try to be innovative and creative when interacting with our audience. With an interest in written poetry, I went to look for ways to present poetry in an interactive way. This paper/project explores the potential of poetry in a digital form. It explains the process of combining visual art with technology and digital sensory to communicate poetry in a new format. This paper will explain the idea behind the project, the methodology used to apply it, the materials, and the technology embedded in it.
