    First paragraph:
      Youth Moves, an anthology edited by Nadine Dolby and Fazal Rizvi (Routledge, 2008)
      Youth Moves , a new collection of critical essays, seeks to create a sketch of today’s global youth. To begin, editors Nadine Dolby and Fazal Rizvi tell a story about a young woman criss-crossing the globe from the U.S. to South Africa and back to the U.S. to visit relatives. With this image of the “global soul” in mind, Dolby and Rizvi open the conversation into different types of youth movements: both physical and figurative within the milieu of the  ever-increasing pace of commodity, culture, and idea generation of today’s networked world.
