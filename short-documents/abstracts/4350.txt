Multicast is an important routing service for many of fundamental applications such as Webcasting, Video Streaming or Conferencing, Online Games. On the other hand, as much as Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are growing and become more complex, the need for modification of Multicast Routing for WMNs with different constraints are increased as well. Therefor Researches on multicasting in WMN is still in initial stage.
We focused on Multicasting over Single Channel WMNs with multiple group flows scenario. The main challenge on this scenario is the impact of interference between multiple flows on the performance of multicast flows. By increasing number of receiver nodes in a single channel area, the interference caused by multiple simultaneous flows in the network cannot be fully avoidable, but implementing a proper routing helps to improve the performance of the flows.
In this research, we develop a new interference-aware routing metrics and implement it in our purposed routing scheme (IMRP) for multicasting multiple flows in WMNs. Our purposed metrics takes some new defined attributes of routing path into account. The purposed scheme is evaluated by simulating on Riverbed Modeller 17.5. Simulation and testbed experiments show that our proposed routing significantly improves the total Throughput as well as total Packet Delivery Ratio of multicast flows compared to existing standards.
