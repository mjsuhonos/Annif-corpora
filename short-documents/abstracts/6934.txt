The Niagara Region contains land that is ideal for agricultural practices. This thesis strives to
illuminate whether or not urban growth in the Niagara Region is a detriment to agricultural land
use. Using Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI-TIRS satellite imagery, spatial statistics, called landscape
metrics, will be utilized to determine growth and loss of urban and agriculture land uses. Satellite
imagery will be classified based on researched methods in order to create land class maps. These
maps will then be utilized for landscape metrics using the Patch Analyst extension for ArcMap.
Change detection methods will also be observed. The above methods will be done for the overall
landscape of the Niagara Region. This study will find that agriculture in the Niagara Region is
changing and endeavors to highlight how urban sprawl is part of the cause. Fragmentation will be
discussed as part of the issues due to urban sprawl.
