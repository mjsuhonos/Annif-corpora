This research concentrated on the nonlinear finite element (FE) modeling of one-way composite floor slab system comprising of profiled steel deck and two types of concrete namely, Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) and Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC). Two FE models were developed based experimental results of composite slabs subjected to in-plane monotonic loading. The simulated load-deflection response, moment resistance, and shear bond capacity using two FE models were in reasonable good agreement with experimental results. The FE models were used in a comprehensive parametric study to investigate the effect of numerical model parameters such as mesh size, dilation angle, steel sheet-concrete interaction contact, material properties and composite slab span. In addition, FE models were used to determine shear bond parameters of ECC and SCC composite slabs that can be used for design purposes.
