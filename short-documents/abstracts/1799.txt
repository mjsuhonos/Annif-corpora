    Tactical urbanism initiatives working to combat the presence of vacant storefronts are not yet commonly found in Canadian cities. This paper reports on an interview study investigating the potential for tactical urbanism to enhance the vibrancy of commercial corridors in Toronto, Canada, and how such an initiative may affect a variety of potential stakeholders as well as its compatibility with municipal governance and planning practice. Results show popularity of concept amongst potential stakeholders, the need for changes to provincial legislation and the evolving role of the Toronto planning professional to tap into the experimental enthusiasm of local community players.
    Key words: tactical urbanism; vacant storefronts; Toronto.
