Across a breadth of disciplines, the criticism of automobile dependence and the re-conceptualization of mass transit infrastructure have become critical matters of concern. This thesis recognizes these concerns as architectural issues, and argues that design methodology can integrate solutions which respond to the challenges of our decentralized and fragmented urban landscape.

The following thesis is an investigation of the relationship between infrastructure and architecture, which explores and identifies opportunities within the unique challenges posed by transportation within the context of the rapid densification of the Greater Golden Horseshoe Area. Rather than subscribing to the utilitarian foundation of infrastructure, this thesis recognizes the significant design potential within this operative system and morphology. In doing so, the thesis project proposes a disciplinary hybrid, which calibrates and synthesizes landscape, infrastructure and architecture.
