The purpose of this poster is to highlight cross-domain metadata uses, metadata mapping, and success measures at the Ryerson University Library and Archives. The Library is highly involved in Ryerson-based proposals for interdisciplinary projects, especially in the Digital Humanities. Designing an online environment for the preservation and analysis of illustrated texts for children and Canadiana is a collaborative effort that involves cataloguing, metadata mapping, digitization, and website design.
