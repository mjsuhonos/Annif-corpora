    Using power electronic converters with reduced capacity in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbines make them vulnerable to over-current during grid disturbances. This thesis aims to analyze the behaviour of doubly-fed induction generators based wind farm for various timing schemes of crowbar deactivation and resumption of rotor side converter (RSC) in the case of grid fault. Also, usage of a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) for the purpose of stabilizing the grid voltage after a three-phase fault is studied in this these. Moreover, finding minimum capacity of STATCOM which ensures low-voltage ride through (LVRT) of wind farm is studied. Finally, coordination of reactive power from wind turbine generators and STATCOM in steady-state condition is performed. All the results in this thesis show that STATCOM improves low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability of wind farm and assists for an uninterrupted operation of wind turbine generators during grid faults.
