The intention of this research is to explore the feasibility of incorporating aggregates of low or marginal quality, such as Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) and aggregate with high sulphate content, in U-fill mixtures. It has been determined that where RCA is used, water dissipation may be hindered due to the increase in fines caused by abrasion, hence causing an increase in hardening time. To reduce this effect, addition of natural aggregates may be necessary. Moreover, through a series of investigation it has been found that high percentages of sulphate may cause severe damage due to Ettringite and Thaumasite formation; however by incorporation of supplementary materials such as slag the deleterious effects of internal sulphate attack can be reduced. The effects of using Na2SO4 and gypsum in the presence of slag have also been investigated. Results indicated that due to the lower available calcium content within bars containing Na2SO4 expansion rate is low.
