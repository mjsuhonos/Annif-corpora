In architecture, atmosphere is a term that is used to describe an intangible characteristic that permeates our built environments. The feeling of atmosphere is a direct result of one’s perceptible circumstances, which are shaped by what architects design and how they go about designing it. But for a construct that is grounded in the reality of the buildings architects design, there is a clear lack of consideration and discourse on the subject of atmosphere in the design of architecture. As a result, atmosphere in architecture has been relegated to a default atmosphere by architectural processes that focus on the conceptualization of buildings as ideal objects. In order to consider atmosphere in architecture designers must acknowledge in their designs the importance of a building’s temporal nature, its effect on one’s corporeal presence, and the surrounding environment. This thesis work is an evolving exploration into designing an architecture of atmosphere
