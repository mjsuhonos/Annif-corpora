The purpose of this study is to examine the number, health, and species of trees in the gentrifying neighbourhood of the Junction Triangle. In this research, the tree inventory and questionnaire method were used. The questionnaire results show that respondents who moved in prior to 2007 view gentrification more negatively than residents who moved in after. The study found that there is a net growth of trees in the study area. Many invasive species have been removed, while more city recommended species have been planted. This research went on to find that trees in front of homes are in better condition than those planted on public land, and trees in front of improved homes are in better condition than those in front of unimproved homes. This is evidenced by the visible tree care and maintenance activities that are occurring on trees in front of housing but is absent from trees on public land.
