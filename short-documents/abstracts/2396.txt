    Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Wi-Fi WLANs have achieved widespread applicability in different application domains. However, tag range of RFID systems is very short. Hence, integrating RFID with WLAN networks can contribute to wider application of RFID since Wi-FI nodes have much larger communication range. However, both RFID and WLAN use the same frequency band and incurs interference by [sic] each other for channel utilization.
    In this thesis, an efficient approach to solve the coexistence and integration problem of RFID and Wi-Fi WLAN is proposed. This solution allows these networks to access the medium in a time sharing manner by making the WLAN Access Point (AP) aware of the RFID neighboring network at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Thus, it is possible to locate and identify the RFID tags in the physical space, with co-located Wi-Fi WLANS. Simulation results show that both networks work together by maintaining the performance such as higher throughput and lower collision probability, as is desired.
