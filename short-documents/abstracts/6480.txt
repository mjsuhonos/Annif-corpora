This study focuses on the perspectives of kindergarten children regarding their perceptions of gender appropriateness of play materials. The theory of gender performativity has been used as a theoretical lens for the study. Six kindergarten children between the ages of four and five were individually interviewed about whether they believed toys to be gender-specific or gender-neutral. Results indicated that children displayed gender-stereotype knowledge as well as an understanding that toys can be gender-neutral, however, they were generally perceived to be gender-specific. Themes found include: perceptions of play materials as gender-neutral, perceptions of play materials as male-appropriate, perceptions of play materials as female-appropriate, notions of gender stereotypes, gender-role flexibility, contingent gender-role flexibility and external knowledge sources. Implications of these results regarding both gender-conforming as well as gender-non conforming children are provided and recommendations for educators are suggested.
