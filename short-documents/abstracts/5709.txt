In a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) system, when the heating and cooling loads are not balanced, the ground temperature may migrate up or down after a few years of operation. This change in ground temperature can lower system efficiency because of the ineffective heat transfer temperatures. The present work contributes to fundamental understanding of thermal imbalance in borehole design. Long term ground temperatures were simulated using finite element methods to imitate the performance of GSHP systems. Borehole field configurations are explored and different aspect ratios of borehole layouts were compared. In addition, an alternative borehole configuration was studied, which involves alternating the length of individual boreholes within a single system. The results of the studies expressed potential in alleviating the effects of thermal imbalance by changing borehole field layout and potential in reducing borehole separation distance by altering individual borehole lengths.
