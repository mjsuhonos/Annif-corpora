This thesis addresses two groups of photographs by the multi-disciplinary Canadian artist Charles Gagnon (1934-2003) from the Art Gallery of Ontario’s collection. The first are 21 SX-70 type Polaroid colour prints made between 1976 and 1979. The second are 18 small black and white photographs taken with a Minox camera between 1977 and 1978. This currently represents the largest collection of these works by Gagnon. This thesis investigates their position and role within the larger context of the artist’s oeuvre. The apparatuses used in the production of these photographs are very particular and differ from traditional 35mm film photography. The traces of these characteristics emerge in the photographs and illustrate a connection to Gagnon’s work in other mediums that is rooted in his philosophical dispositions as an artist.
