Metastasis, the migration of tumor cells, occupies the lymphatic system via populating inside lymph nodes and forming secondary tumors. Hyperthermia is a treatment modality that eradicates cancer cells based on the denaturation of proteins and plasma cell membrane at temperatures above 40 Â°C. Magnetic nanoparticles have been used to determine nodal cancer stage due to their natural deposition into lymph nodes post-injection. Magnetic hyperthermia involves the application of magnetic nanoparticles under the influence of an alternating magnetic field in order to generate elevated temperatures within a target location.
This study aims to investigate the cell killing effect of magnetic hyperthermia in MDA-MB-231 cells in a lymph node in vitro model based on its geometric conditions, promising magnetic nanoparticle concentration, and feasible alternating magnetic field parameters. Evaluation was performed with trypan blue exclusion, annexin-V APC / PI flow cytometry and MTT assays.
