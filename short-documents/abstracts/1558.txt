    The treatment of latex paint wastewater with ultrafiltration allows for the reuse of the filtrate as process water or for cleaning purposes, as well as the potential for reclamation of the valuable paint solids. In this study, the utilization of polycarbonate membranes for the ultrafiltration of dilute latex dispersions was evaluated. Hydrophilic, flat sheet ultrafiltration membranes with a mean pore size of 0.1 μm were used. All filtration experiments were conducted under constant pressure operation, in a circular, centre-fed, cross-flow filtration cell.
    The effect of feed flow rate was investigated, and the steady-state permeate flux achieved showed an increase of 294% between 1.0 and 3.0 L/min. Increasing the operating pressure also resulted in an increased permeate flux, with a 320% increase from 1.5 to 5.5 psi. Also considered was the effect of the feed solid concentration on the permeate flux. When compared to the clean water flux (0% solids) of 5.5×10-2 m3/m2.s, increasing the feed solid concentration to 0.21% led to a decrease of 290% to 4.04×10-2 m3/m2.s steady-state permeate flux.
    Surfactant-enhanced ultrafiltration was also studied, with concentrations ranging from 25% to 200% of the literature values of the surfactant's critical micelle concentration (CMC) in pure water. The addition of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), reduced the effectiveness of the filtration. However, the addition of a cationic surfactant, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), increased the permeate flux of the latex dispersion up to 130% when twice its CMC was used, with evidence of a reduction in the effect of fouling of the membranes. This may be due to repelling interactions between the surface of the membrane and the surface of the formed micelles, as well as a reduced cake resistance due to the larger particle size of the constituents forming a less dense cake layer.
