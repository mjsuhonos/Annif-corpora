Internet access is being seen more and more as a basic human right. Yet the Internet remains inaccessible for many. Guidelines on accessibility exist, as do penalties for noncompliance, yet 84% of startup websites remain inaccessible. Accessibility is the capacity for individuals to equivalently use goods and services. The purpose of this research is to determine if exposure to an online resource focusing on how to make startups accessible, rather than why, impacts the willingness of individuals to adopt accessible strategies. Through the use of pre- and postsurveys, the impact on willingness was measured and compared to pre-exposure levels. The results suggest that startups may be willing to adopt accessibility guidelines after explicitly being shown how, however a gap still remains between willingness and execution.
