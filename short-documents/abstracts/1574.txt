    In this study, a new bone remodeling model which combines mechanical loading and bone metabolism factors is used to predict the evolution of bone density after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). A 3D finite element (FE) model of the distal femoral bone, coupled with a new thermodynamic-based theory (BRT), was developed in ANSYS. An axial load of 3000N was applied to the FE model, and the bone density distribution in the femoral bone was calculated. The results were then compared with those obtained from the strain energy density (SED) model and the clinical observations. This comparison showed that the bone density distribution predicted by the thermodynamic-based model before and after TKA is consistent with the structure of the distal femur obtained from X-rays. Furthermore, the predicted bone density distribution using BRT showed a gradual and uniform evolution contrary to the SED model, where there is no gradual bone density evolution.
