    Diagramming languages are heavily used in design and system analysis. Different languages have varying impacts on the effectiveness of designers. The author believes that there is no appropriate diagramming tool that is of substantial benefit to designers, especially in the early, pre-geometry stages of product development. A new tool, design schematics (DS), is introduced to fulfill this need. The general benefits of diagramming are outlined and the potential of diagramming tools is explored. Advantages and disadvantages of some existing diagramming methods are discussed. Analysis of diagramming methods motivates the development of DS. DS is consistent with the generic design process developed by Salustri. Several interrelated examples demonstrate how DS can capture important information during design stages. A detailed example of a coffee maker is carried out. It is executed as if the author were actually designing a coffee maker. Interrelated diagrams of the design highlight how DS helps in designing during the early stages. Computer support for development and full exploitation of DS is needed. The author believes that DS can be of great benefit to practising engineers. While there is not yet any quantitative data by which DS can be evaluated, there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that the tool has potential to be of benefit in design areas.
