Mexico’s addition to the list of Designated Countries of Origin (DCO) i.e. safe countries in
light of extreme human rights violations and government corruption raises many questions.
Using government data obtained through the Access to Information Act, this qualitative
study examines the DCO policy and safe country designation process and applies the
country designation criteria to the case of Mexico. Through government discourse, the
securitization of migration and the construct of the ‘criminal’ refugee claimant have
become normalized, leading to exclusionary immigration legislation. While questioning
whether or not Mexico belongs on the DCO list, this study reveals the unjustifiable
discrimination contained in Canadian refugee policy, specifically the Protecting Canada’s
Immigration System Act (Bill C-31).
