In this thesis we investigate the stability of free-surface flow on a heated incline. We develop a complete mathematical model for the flow which captures the Marangoni effect and also accounts for changes in the properties of the fluid with temperature. We apply a linear stability analysis to determine the stability of the steady and uniform flow. The associated eigenvalue problem is solved numerically by means of a spectral colocation method.
