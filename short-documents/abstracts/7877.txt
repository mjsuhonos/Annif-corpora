Fashion retailers and fashion exhibitions are at a pivotal moment in 2019 as both accommodate changes including the decrease of in-person shopping and the increased visitorship of fashion exhibitions. At the heart of both spaces, however, is the display of fashion â€“whether simple or grandiose. This project looks further at the similarities of displaying fashion in both spaces, with possible consequences and potential futures for each space. It brings together extensive literature and field visits to nearly 100 different spaces, with a creative installation of a third type of space integrating both museums and retailers as a possible solution for the future
