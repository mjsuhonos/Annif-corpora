The role light that plays in architecture is not simply to brighten a room to enable people to see, but also to create atmospheres and define spaces. The quality of light affects our perception of space. Light has the power to enhance our experience of spaces by increasing pleasure and comfort. Conversely, light can make spaces uncomfortable for users. This thesis demonstrates how light with materiality and tectonic qualities can create different tactical and atmospheric conditions to strategically enhance the relationships of user to space and user to nature. By considering light in design, architects can turn light into a design feature and use it to create a variety of spatial perceptions. Light can define a room’s characteristics and create atmosphere so that people feel connected to that space through association with natural lighting phenomena. Consequently, lighting can be used as a tool to enhance the user’s experience with architecture
