    Several mathematical models with varying degrees of complexity are dedicated to characterizing influenza virus infection kinetics. The majority of existing mathematical models of in-host kinetics are based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and do not incorporate viral transport modes. In this work, a spatial model was developed in order to explore, for the first time, the effect of viral transport modes in-vivo: diffusion and advection. Cellular regeneration and a simplifed immune response were also included in this model. Although severe and chronic infections sometimes occur in humans, most of the existing models can only reproduce seasonal infections. This new model has success-fully reproduced observed infection profiles within realistic biological parameters. The changes in parameters required to shift the infection kinetics from a seasonal to a chronic infection, for example, is consistent with the factors believed to be responsible for the establishment of such infections.
