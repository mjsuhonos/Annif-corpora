    The outstanding potential capability of flapping-wing aerial micro robots to perform gamut [sic] of applications ranging from indoor and confined space missions to perilous environment explorations elevates them from conventional fixed and rotary wing micro aerial vehicles. Despite the remarkable progress in development of manufacturing paradigms to fabricate an at-scale insect-like aerial micro robot, the existing methods are still incompetent to mimic even the most basic maneuvers [sic] of the flying insects. This incompetency comes from technological limitations in terms of size and power density as well as lack of thorough insight into the complex neuromuscular actuation mechanism of the insects' wing. These limitations raise the motivation to develop a simulation framework to be used to analyze the stability and flight dynamics of the insect-like aerial micro robots, and provide a means by which the controller design for these systems could be accomplished.
    This thesis describes the development of such simulation framework in the context of dynamic modelling and controller design. A consistent set of dynamic and kinematic equations of motion are developed, and the application of the model predictive control strategy for insect-like flapping wing aerial micro robots is investsigated.
