    A broad view on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) study is made and the hierarchical structure is shown in Local-Feedback-Global-Cascade (LFGC) model, which is built to explore the role of reflex feedback. This feedback, which integrates additive and multiple functionalities in multifractal cascade models, functions on the She-Waymire (SW) form of the hierarchical structure so that the concept of defect dynamics can be applied to LFGC model. The experimental evidence verified the existence of the hierarchical structure and showed discrete scale invariance in data supported the additive feedback law, which may exist in the cardiovascular system in harmony with this dynamical cascade model.
