This study examines how the Internationally Educated Social Work Professionals Bridging Program at Ryerson University facilitates the integration of Internationally Educated Social Workers (IESWs) into the Canadian labour market.  Research indicates that Internationally Educated Professionals (IEPs) often face significant barriers that restrict them from effectively utilizing their foreign-obtained human capital.  Occupational bridging programs are one type of program that has proven effective at increasing the employment rates of the IEPs who participate in them (Adamowicz, 2004; Dean Marie, Austin, & Zubin, 2004; Alboim, Finnie, & Meng, 2005).  Through individual interviews conducted with program participants and key stakeholder representatives, this study identifies the barriers that IESWs face in the labour market, the challenges facing the IESW bridging program, and the perceived benefits of the program.  The findings of this study reveal that unlike other labour market integration programs the IESWs bridging program comprehensively addresses many of the individual and systemic barriers that restrict IESWs from maximizing returns to their human capital.
