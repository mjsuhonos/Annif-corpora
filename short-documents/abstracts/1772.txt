    This thesis constructs a history surrounding the organization and hanging of the 1910 International Exhibition of Pictorial Photography, which was arranged by Alfred Stieglitz and the Photo-Secession for the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery (then the Albright Art Gallery). This history identifies those involved in the planning and execution of the exhibition and is presented as a timeline of events revealed largely through correspondence between Stieglitz and Cornelia Sage, Director of the Albright Art Gallery. This thesis also examines in detail the installation of the 594 selected works exhibited at the Buffalo institution. In addition, this thesis project outlines the procedure of developing a small exhibition to honor the centennial anniversary of the International Exhibition of Pictorial Photography. Presented to the curatorial staff at George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film in Rochester, New York, the proposed exhibition is intended to hang during the 2010 calendar year.
