Demographic projections of many western democracies show them to be aging nations. To keep thriving we must ensure that our citizens are aging in a healthy manner without isolation from society. This means, in turn, that we must increase our understanding for the experience of aging in society. Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most misunderstood conditions for our aging populations, and is a problematic condition for caregivers and family members to support. This MRP seeks to build extended reality experiences that immerse users emotionally in some of the symptoms of aging and Alzheimer’s to build understanding and empathy. The project seeks to use mixed reality to make a positive social impact on the general population.
