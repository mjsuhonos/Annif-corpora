This essay documents and justifies a practical project in collections management, in
which I surveyed ten albums of photographs and recorded information about them, using a
system of my own devising. The descriptive tables included here serve as a finding aid for the
contents of albums that are not catalogued at the unit level, offers quick comparison among the
albums, and efficiently assembles necessary information for unit-level cataloguing. It also
demonstrates a model approach to pre-cataloguing surveys, especially when a particular genre is
being studied in more than one album. A system such as this, customized for a specific category
or genre of photograph, can provide researchers with thorough and appropriate information
specific to their needs. This project deals specifically with the genre of photographic
reproductions of works of art, found in ten nineteenth century albums of travels to Italy in the
collection of George Eastman House.
