The thesis presents a FPCB (Flexible Printed Circuit Board) actuator driven micromirror and the laser pattern generating technology for availability indicator and laser pattern pointer. The FPCB micromirror consists of a FPCB electrostatic parallel plate actuator and a bonded silicon mirror plate. It has the advantages of much larger aperture size, higher surface quality and lower cost than conventional MEMs micromirrors. The FPCB micromirror resonates at its first bending mode. Two FPCB micromirrors are positioned orthogonally to reflect a laser beam. By controlling the vibration frequency and magnitude of these two micromirrors, laser patterns of rotating ellipse or static circle, horizontal or vertical line can be generated and projected to a remote surface, e.g., a translucent or a presentation screen. Based on the FPCB micromirror, an availability indicator is developed, which can solve the wiring problem plaguing existing availability indicators. A laser pattern pointer is also developed which has much better visibility than conventional laser pointers with highlighting functions.
