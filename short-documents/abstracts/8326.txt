Control of the microchannelsâ€™ cross-sectional shape may be of interest in micro-heat sinks, microfluidic particle sorting, and micro-machine lubrication applications. Previously, inverse methods have been used to determine the abrasive jet micromachining (AJM) traverse speed and path required to sculpt the desired cross-section for low Aspect Ratio (AR, the ratio of depth to width, see page xiv) topographies (<0.06). This thesisintroduces an iterative inverse method which
allows prediction of the machining procedure required to sculpt high AR (>0.06-1) microchannels of prescribed cross-sectional shape using mask-less AJM. The predictions were experimentally verified for trapezoidal and semi-circular micro-channels and protruded features in borosilicate glass, and symmetric and non-symmetric wedges in poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA). Overall, the average accuracy of the machined profiles was 93.6 % in borosilicate glass and 91 % in PMMA. The methodology opens up new possibilities for the micro-fabrication of high-aspect-ratio micro-features of virtually any desired shape.
