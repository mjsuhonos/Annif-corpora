With the increases to healthcare expenditures and with technology playing a more critical role in hospitals, IT outsourcing has become an important topic for hospital executives. There has been a lack of research in Canadian healthcare on IT outsourcing within hospitals. This research explores the several factors associated with hospital CIOs and Managers in outsourcing their IT systems. Additionally, this research looks to identify the benefits, risks and alternatives to IT outsourcing within Canada, specifically within the province of Ontario. While transaction, agency and knowledge-based theories are discussed, they are not tested. They provide more of a guide and confirmation of these decision factors. Hospital CIOs and Managers were interviewed and recorded to determine the decision factors. Lacity et al (2010) IT Outsourcing decision model was used as a starting point for the decision factors and a Canadian model was developed from an adaption of Lacity et al work. This research provides a starting point for IT outsourcing research within the Ontario hospital sector.
