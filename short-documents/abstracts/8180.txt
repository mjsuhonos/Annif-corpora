This thesis examines the effects of exposure to ambient noise and air pollution and access to available greenspace on cardiovascular health in Toronto, Ontario. The study is focused around the population health approach which is used to understand the health of the whole population and to reduce health inequalities amongst population groups. The study utilizes population data from the 2012-2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), air quality data from 2010-2014, noise exposure data from 2016, and the DMTI land use parks and recreation data to conduct a logistic regression analysis. The results from the analysis showed significant effects for noise when evaluated individually and measured cumulatively with air pollution and greenspace. Greenspace showed significant results when controlling for behavioural covariates, whereas air pollution displayed conflicting results for acute exposure. Future research on multiple environmental stressors should look to validate the importance of both ambient stressors through a longitudinal study.
