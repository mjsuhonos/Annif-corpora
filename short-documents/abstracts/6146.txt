This study used narrative inquiry to collect the stories of educators working in a multiage setting.  Interviews with five staff from two centres in Ontario and one in British Columbia yielded six rich narratives.  Some of the themes that emerged from the findings were 1) Perceived Preparedness 2) Experience in the field and 3) Development of a Professional Philosophy.  The results of this study support the value of narratives as a tool for professional practice, peer collaboration and reflective practice.
