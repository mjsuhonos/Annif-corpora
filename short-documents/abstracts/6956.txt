This study explores the opportunity to implement environmental instruments to promote sustainable tourism development. Environmental instruments are tools, regulations and strategies that can improve the sustainability of a destination. This study was based on ideas from Governing the Commons Theory and Stakeholder Theory, which suggests sustainable development can be achieved by including stakeholders to form collective management and avoid natural resource tragedies. The study uses face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (n=41) to explore environmental instruments to implement in Savusavu, Fiji -- a small island developing state (SIDS). The study identified lack of waste management, education and participation amongst stakeholders and the islandâ€™s susceptibility to climate change as the key issues the destination faces in developing a sustainable tourism industry. The study recommends implementing a voluntary fund, environmental education and stakeholder participation instruments to promote sustainable development in Savusavu.
