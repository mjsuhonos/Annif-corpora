    The finite element method has been applied in the area of the cervical spine since the 1970's. In the present research work, the finite element method was employed to model, validate and analyze a complete model of the human cervical spine from C1 to T1, including interconnecting intervertebral discs, ligaments and joints.
    The developed model of the cervical spine was validated by the experimental results presented in the literature. As the values obtained from the finite element analysis were mainly in the range of motion observed in the experiment; it was concluded that the finite element results were consistent with the reported data in the literature. Next, the validated model of the cervical spine was examined under physiological loading modes to locate the areas bearing maximum stress in the cervical spine. Finally, to study the effect of variations in the material properties on the output of the finite element analysis, a material property sensitivity study was conducted to the C3-T1 model of cervical spine. Changes in the material properties of the soft tissues affected the external and internal responses of both the hard and soft tissue components, while changes in those of the hard tissues only affected the internal response of hard tissues.
