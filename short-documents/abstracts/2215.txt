    The past decade has been marked by a substantial shift in planning for more compact, complete and pedestrian-oriented communities. Amidst this broader evolution, greater emphasis is being increasingly placed on creating healthy and ‘complete communities’, particularly through the provision of enhanced ‘active transportation’ networks. The overall purpose of this Major Research Paper (MRP) will be to recommend Official Plan policies to more effectively support the role of ‘active transportation’ in creating more ‘complete communities’ in the Town of Innisfil, a rapidly growing municipality located approximately one hour north of the City of Toronto. The underlying argument of this MRP is that enhanced active transportation networks can play an integral role in building more sustainable, healthy and ‘complete’ communities within the Town of Innisfil, because of the substantial environmental, economic, and social benefits that they can provide. Furthermore, planning policies must encompass all elements of planning, designing, implementing and monitoring in order to support the achievement of enhanced active transportation networks.
