Gender differences in the preoperative profiles and postoperative outcomes of patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery raises the question of whether gender also influences learning needs that may necessitate different approaches to the education of these vulnerable patients.The purpose of this study was to examine if learning needs differed between males and females after CABG surgery in the immediate period prior to and after discharge.This secondary analysis utilized a non-experimental, descriptive-comparative design based on existing data. The sample was selected based on a matched-pairs sampling method (32 males, 32 females). Learning needs were assessed through the use of the Patient Learning Needs Scale. Significant gender differences were found in the rank ordering of learning needs and the type of learning needs relating to physical activities only after discharge. These finding suggest that gender and the timing of appraisal may influence the learning needs of patients after CABG surgery.
