Marion Faller (1941-2014) was a photographer and educator; this thesis explores her body of work through the collection of her photographs at George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film. Hey Baby, Take My Picture, 1972–1975; Second Flora, Contemporary Work, 1987–1999, represent Faller’s independent practise. Included in the thesis is a discussion of the collaborations Faller produced with her partner, experimental filmmaker Hollis Frampton (1936-1984), Vegetable Locomotion, 1975; False Impressions, 1979. The thesis provides a detailed account of Faller’s work through an explanation of the collection’s formation, literature review, chronology of Faller’s life, and detailed catalogue records
