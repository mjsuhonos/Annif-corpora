This research study examined the use of blogging as a medium for professional learning for registered early childhood educators (RECEs) in Ontario. Although educators are more frequently turning to blogs, social media, and virtual learning communities for their professional learning, there is a limited amount of previous research which has examined the use and efficacy of these mediums for that purpose. Using grounded theory, and guided by a social constructivist framework, I gathered data from blog posts and comments written by a small group of RECEs practicing in Ontario, and conducted interviews at two intervals to gather their perceptions of the blogging experience. While further study is needed to address potential barriers which may hinder RECEs from using blogging, I found that there were benefits in the use of blogging as a medium for reflection, building a professional community, and professional learning.
