    Biological organisms, from microbes, to plants, to humans, survive in part because these bodies respond and react to changes within and outside their bodies. In order to function, these living things use sensors to read the environment and sense changes, and relay information back and forth. Sensors should no longer have one simple functional role but should be a node in an entire cybernetic network. By using sensors in a building, we can make systems more efficient, without losing effectiveness of their functions, allowing energy to be saved within an action and reaction feedback network, but more interestingly sensors can be used so that buildings can emerge with greater opportunity for expression and therefore user experiences.
