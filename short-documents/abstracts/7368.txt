Newcomer engagement or participation in the nonprofit sector has been shown to be an important pillar for upholding democracy, linked to voting behaviour and political participation; the creation of social capital; and enhancement of newcomer involvement in local decision making. This paper presents results of a study that focuses on two ways in which immigrant minorities have their interests represented in community decision-making: the first through the formation of ethno-specific voluntary organizations that represent their specific interests; the second via participation as leaders, board members and volunteers in ‘mainstream’ nonprofit and public organizations.
