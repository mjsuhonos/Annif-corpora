This report describes a study which investigated the popularity of using rock beds to store energy collected from
solar air heaters used for residential space heating in Canada. In justifying the popularity of rock beds, a comparative analysis of solar heat storage systems was conducted. Attention was then paid to rock beds design factors. Finally, a preliminary investigation into alternative storage possibilities as the packing medium in the beds indicate such alternatives merit future development.
