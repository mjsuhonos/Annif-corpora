    Using biometrics for personal identity authentication is becoming more reliable and accurate than current methods because it links the event to a particular individual (e.g. a password may be used by someone other that the authorized user), is convenient (nothing to carry or remember), accurate (provides positive authentication) and is socially acceptable. Adaptive frequency sub-band or time frame recombination approaches are introduced in this thesis.
