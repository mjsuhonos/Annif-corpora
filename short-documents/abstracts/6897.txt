Koreans have immigrated to Canada in the last twenty years seeking a better quality of life. The vast majority of recent Korean immigrants have been accepted under the economic class category, which indicates that they have either human capital or financial capital. However, most Korean immigrants experience downward mobility and reside in an ethnic bubble. Furthermore, mainly low confidence in English communication and cultural differences have impeded the participation in multicultural settlement services. Even some of the existing employment programs offered by settlement service providers are not approachable due to the limitation of eligibility. 

This practical MRP attempts to find a pragmatic solution to address the skill under-utilization issues experienced by skilled Korean immigrants. A specialized mentoring program is examined as a support for skilled Korean immigrants. The program aims to give them access to the Canadian labour market by integrating multiple facets of settlement and employment services.
