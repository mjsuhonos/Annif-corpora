A series of sensitivity analysis was performed to a variety of design parameters as a way of increasing the knowledge base of automatically sizing GSHPs as a component of a hybrid system. The present work investigates the effects of geographical location (weather patterns and utility rates), operating costs (fixed vs. time-of-use rates), inflation rates, the control strategies used, project life, heat pump entering fluid temperature (EFT), carbon taxation, and building retrofit on the sizing of hybrid GSHP systems in North America. Based on an economic approach to sizing hybrid GSHP systems by selecting the most economical design (based on minimizing the net present value of capital and operating costs), significant energy and cost savings and reductions in CO2 emissions can be achieved.
