    This thesis examines worker learning and forgetting in dual resource constrained systems according to the dual-phase learning-forgetting model (DPLFM). The contributions are as follows: (1) equations were developed that output controllable shop factors such as training and transfer policies given existing factors such as the degree of job similarity, processing times, and the learning and forgetting rate of the worker, (2) results suggest that the task-type factor with respect to the worker learning rate and proportion of cognitive and motor elements is a factor to include in DRC research, and (3) the results have suggested that the DPLFM emphasized a greater benefit for upfront training and more frequent transfer policy than the learn forget curve model (LFCM) when tasks are similar, and supported the conclusions of Jaber et al. (2003) by an even greater extent that it is possible to use more flexibility in DRC shops with similar tasks.
