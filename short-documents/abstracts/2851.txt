A spatial analysis of smog events in Southern Ontario and prevailing winds reveals various patterns that occur during smog advisories. Smog events cause numerous excess deaths and illnesses each year throughout Southern Ontario due to high levels of air pollutants that are generated in North America. Cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses are the main hospital admissions that occur during summer smog episodes. These effects are experienced throughout regions located along the Windsor-Quebec corridor, but there are variations in the numbers of affected people due to the effects of surrounding geographical features and the local contribution of air contaminants. Meteorological differences play a major role in the effects of smog events with factors such as temperature and prevailing winds. This study examines the effects of long distance transport of contaminants from origins in the United States into Canada as indicated by respiratory and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity effects during 9 smog events. This study found that during certain conditions there is a correlation between wind direction and smog related mortality and morbidity.
