The present paper studies consumer digital photography as a cultural and social phenomenon contributing to the formation of contemporary identity. By examining the processes of production, characteristic style of representation and practical uses of both digital and analogue photographs, the study attempts to establish the qualitative
distinctions between traditional and present-day photographic media and evaluate their effectiveness as modes of self-representation.  Specific issues discussed include: the depreciation of the photograph as a commemorative object; intervention of digital photography into life experiences; digital photography as common behaviour or interactive ritual; and photographic theatricality as identity forming process.
