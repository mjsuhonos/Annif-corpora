    This qualitative and exploratory research project focuses on observing Aliddesa, a grassroots organization that is made up of Spanish speaking newcomer women based in Toronto. Via interviews, personal reflections in writing, and a focus group with three members of Aliddesa, research findings provide insight into the participantâ€™s personal experiences of resettlement and their perceptions about community development work. Research recommendations point to the value of reconceptualizing the resettlement process by documenting the real life stories of newcomer women, and also, by developing a model of resettlement that more acutely describes this process with issues of gender as the primary focus. In addition, research findings are analysed from a conceptual framework of cultural citizenship theory,suggesting that it is a relevant paradigm to discuss and highlight the contributions that are made by newcomer women and also the benefits that enrich Canadian society as a result of their activities.
