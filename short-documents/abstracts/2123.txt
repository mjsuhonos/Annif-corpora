    A downlink scheduling scheme called coordinated location dependent downlink scheduling scheme (CLDSS), that combines the intra-cell power allocation and inter-cell transmission coordination is proposed to be used in TD-CDMA networks. In the proposed scheme, each cell in the cellular network is partitioned into co-centric areas based on the load distribution in the cell. The transmissions from base stations are controlled based on the intra-cell load as well as coordinated to minimize inter-cell interference.     The average throughput employing the CLDSS is analyzed for a 2-(square) cell system in shallow fading environment with 2 (square) partitioned areas for each cell. Simulation study is also done to validate the numerical results obtained from the analytical study. It is shown that CLDSS scheme can provide soft throughput, i.e. the average throughput remains relatively invariant with the number of users and also provide good performance even in the non-uniform user distribution within a cell. The CLDSS scheme can also improve the fairness in terms of achievable throughput to users anywhere in the cell.
