In the post-9/11 era, the Canadian and the United States government are facing two
phenomena, Narco-Terrorism and Crime-Terror Nexus. Terrorist groups and transnational
organized crime are aligning their illicit activities. This thesis will demonstrate how the
convergence of these two clandestine enterprises changes human trafficking and smuggling
operations, and thus pose a higher caliber threat to vulnerable populations, such as victims of
trafficking and refugees. Links will be drawn to explain why Canada’s current border security
and refugee system are ill-equipped to address these nefarious activities. The thesis proposes
recommendations offered by Canadian experts in the field of migration policy and international
security. However, implementations depend heavily on how receptive Canada’s general public
is. The majority of Canadians are not aware that issues of human trafficking and smuggling and
refugee are intertwined with border security, transnational organized crime, and now terrorist
groups.
