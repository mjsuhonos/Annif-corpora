    Traditionally tall structures have been modeled as simple lossless transmission lines. This model is inadequate for the CN Tower, which may be modeled as a series of transmission lines with different characteristic impedances resulting in a reflection coefficient at each discontinuity. Analysis shows that these vary significantly and are related to the ratio of the current derivative peak to the current derivative 10%-90% risetime, suggesting that they are frequency dependent. The magnitude of the reflection from the return stroke front, if it does exist, is much smaller that was previously proposed.     An alternative approach to modeling, based on modeling the current derivative, is proposed and it is found to provide a better match with the measured waveforms. The CN Tower is modeled as a series of uniform lossless transmission lines and the channel is represented by the MTLL model. The features of the measured magnetic field waveform are well reproduced.
