    Photographs of Newfoundland and Labrador contained in two albums from the George Eastman House Legacy Collection constitute the subject of this thesis project. The project consists in accessioning, numbering and cataloguing each image, 299 in total, and in enriching the records with historical and cultural context for the purpose of making these images searchable through the George Eastman House database and accessible to researchers for future projects. This is important because of the historic value associated with the life and deeds of George Eastman and because these images are part of a large and yet not fully catalogued collection of Eastman's private photographs. The Newfoundland album photographs are consecutively numbered 2009:0039:0001 to 0110, the Newfoundland inventory sheets became objects 2009:0040:0001 to 0003, and the Labrador album photographs are numbered 2009:0041:0001 to 0189. These records are now available both electronically and as a hard-copy binder.
