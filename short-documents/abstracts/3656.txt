Energy is fundamental to the economic success and high quality of modern life because of its centrality to economic activity, comfort, and convenience. Significant opportunities for the environmental protection, economic development, and social well-being of communities can be found through the use of district energy systems over traditional means of heating and cooling for buildings. However energy considerations often come as an afterthought to land-use planning, inhibiting the capacity for greater district energy system use and development.

The purpose of this work is to examine key components of the land-use planning process in Ontario, and provide recommendations to the provincial and municipal governments to better support district energy systems through land-use planning policies, plans, and tools.
