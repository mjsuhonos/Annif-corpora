    The purpose of this study was the design of a  prototype calcium polyphosphate tibial implant for implantation into a  sheep. In the design, several design parameters were considered: CPP  implant structural strength, the maximum allowed micromotion of the  structure at the interface with bone and the possibility of the surgeon  implementing the necessary geometric changes on the bone elements during  implant surgical insertion.        A fininte element analysis facilitated the design and allowed for the  effects of the various geometric parameters investigated. This analysis  was based on a real solid model of the sheep tibial bone based on the CT  scans of a five year old sheep, and several were the geometeric  parameters investigated.     The approach of the finite element analysis was very conservative, in  the meaning that the load applied was purposely increased in order to  account for any possibly unknown factors that may exist and not  implemented in the analysis.
