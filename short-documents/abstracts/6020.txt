Through in-depth interviews, this study explores three service provider’s views on immigrant women's experiences while they accessed and utilized services after leaving an abusive relationship. A phenomenological method of inquiry was used to examine services that are available to meet the needs of immigrant women, and the workers’ views on women’s experiences while seeking assistance. The study focuses on an intersecting analysis of the limitations on three levels: services that assist women, the systems of community resources that women utilize, and the broader structural issues such as funding that affect social service organizations. This study includes a discussion of the coordinated community approach as a recommendation for improved assistance for abused women.
