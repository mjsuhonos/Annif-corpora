This work investigates the dynamic energy efficiency of the parallel execution model of an FPGA and the sequential execution model of a processor, for latency-insensitive applications. We create the temporal implementations (sequential instructions) of the MCNC benchmarks to be executed on a processor that employs a 4LUT as its functional unit. This processor is ~716 times inefficient for dynamic energy than a 4LUT FPGA, mainly due to the large amount of memory (instruction/data) that is required to encode the 4LUT based instructions. The size of the memory
(instruction/data) can be reduced by increasing the data-path width and the logic complexity of the ASIC-based functional units of the processor. Particularly, at 64-bit data-path width and when the (instruction/data) memory sizes are reduced to less than ~9% of their corresponding 4LUT-based instructions, the processor with ASIC-based complex functional unit can achieve higher dynamic energy efficiency than the FPGA for MCNC benchmarks.
