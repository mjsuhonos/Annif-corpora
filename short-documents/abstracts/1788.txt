    To improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, magnesium alloys are being considered for automotive and aerospace applications because of their high strength-to-weight ratio. The objective of this thesis was to study monotonic and cyclic deformation behavior of two semi-solid processed (thixomolded) magnesium alloys, AZ91D and AM60B. The fatigue life of these thixomolded alloys was observed to be higher than that of their die cast counterparts. As the total strain amplitude increased, the stress amplitude and plastic strain amplitude increased, while the pseudoelastic modulus decreased. The change in the modulus was attributed to the nonlinear (pseudoelastic) behavior caused by twinning-detwinning during cyclic deformation. The fatigue life increased with decreasing strain ratio, and partial mean stress relaxation occurred mainly in the initial 10-20% of the fatigue life. The fatigue life of theAM60B alloy improved after solution or solution-aging treatment, and the monotonic strength increased by aging, while the thixomolded condition itself exhibited moderate monotonic strength and fatigue life.
