The objective of this study is to develop a modelling method for optimizing the design of a solar chimney integrated solarium to maximize the ventilation rate in the solarium. 

A thermal model is developed and implemented in SIMULINK to simulate the thermal response of the solarium combined with a solar chimney based on the first principle of thermal engineering. Thermal simulations are performed for critical summer days. The greenhouse air temperature and its ventilation rate with various geometrical configurations are calculated on the basis of solar irradiance intensity and ambient temperature. The preliminary numerical simulation results show that a solar chimney, combined with an appropriately inclined roof of a solarium, would be a better option for ventilation improvement in the solarium. The solarium height and solarium/solar chimney cross section areas are the critical parameters. The combination of a shorter solar chimney with a high solarium would be suitable for Toronto.
