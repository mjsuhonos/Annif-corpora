    Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)is expected to become pervasive and ubiquitous, as it can be embedded into everyday items as smart labels. A typical scenario of exploiting RFID is Electronic container seal (E-seal) in container security. Since RFID systems are proposed to be used in such high security applications, cryptographic authentication is necessary to protect the privacy and security of the RFID system itself. In this project, AES128 cryptographic algorithm based on the new approach of authentication protocol was implemented on FPGA environment. A two-way challenge-response authentication scheme is used due to the limited computing power, low die-size, and low-power requirements. The hardware implementation of the algorithm on FPGA provides acceleration and fast prototyping. The positive results in low silicon area ascertain that the authentication algorithm can be implemented in a small RFID tag for more secure system.
