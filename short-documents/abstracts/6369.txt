The current research investigation is focused on estimating the theoretical capacity of a rehabilitated steel marine pile.  The old steel pile can be rehabilitated by installing new concrete encasement (jacket).  The new concrete jacket can be easily connected to the old steel pile using shear friction between old pile and new concrete jacket or additional mechanical or welded connection.  The under-water welding process is a very expensive task and considerable saving can be realized by eliminating this process.

A previous experimental investigation was conducted to evaluate the behaviour of the rehabilitated steel pile.  The maximum load and the load-slip deformation data were recorded for all of the tested specimens.  The test results indicated that the marine pile can be efficiently rehabilitated by installing a concrete jacket using shear friction principles or the bolted connection to avoid the expense of welding under-water.

The theoretical study included the investigation of surface friction, shear friction mechanism and cohesion on the bond capacity.  The effect of the bolted anchor on increasing the effective cross section of the rehabilitated pile is examined.  After investigating the predicted values of various equations developed by various researchers, the shear friction mechanical model developed by CSA 1994 is recommended to be used as the most effective formula that can provide an accurate prediction for the rehabilitated pile capacity.
