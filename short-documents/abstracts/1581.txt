    Glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcements are a viable replacement for corroding steel rebars. GFRP rebar tension lap splices combined with ultra high performance concrete (UHPC) can improve the efficiency of materials and construction in bridge deck construction joints. This thesis investigates the bond performance of high modulus (HM) GFRP rebar splices using UHPC. UHPC slab/beams of 100 -170 MPa concrete having 150 - 300 mm tension splices were tested along with several beams constructed from prefabricated high strength concrete sections with central GFRP spliced UHPC joints. Theoretical analysis was also conducted to evaluate critical splice lengths. Based on comparisons with code design values, recommendations are made on potential failure modes and minimum splice lengths. The serviceability, fatigue, and environmental performance of GFRP in UHPC are also considered. Recommendations from this research will improve the safety and efficiency of GFRP tension lap joints used in bridge decks and other construction
