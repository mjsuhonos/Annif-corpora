    The state-of-the-art in synthesis of nanostructured cell and contra-cell surfaces relies on techniques that utilize elaborate precursor chemicals, catalysts, or vacuum conditions, and any combination thereof. Two types of nanostructures, Na2O nanotips and SiO2 nanofibers, have been fabricated on soda-lime glass using ultrafast laser ablation. Control over nanotip width was demonstrated via laser dwell time and a new tip formation mechanism is proposed. The nanofibers generated in this work display a level of nanomorphology unseen in other fiber fabrication methods. The resulting fibers show striking morphological similarity to proteins that comprise the natural extra cellular matrix. The interaction of both nanostructures with NIH 3T3 fibroblasts was explored by incubating nanostructured glass with fibroblasts over periods of 12 hours, 1 day, or 1 week. Nanotip structures appeared to induce apoptosis in cells while nanofibers influenced cells to display unique, healthy characteristics such as preferential adhesion to nanofibers and increased microvilli generation.
