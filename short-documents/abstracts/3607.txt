This systematic review was conducted to address the clinically relevant question: What approach, mode, and dose is most effective in producing changes in CABG patient education? The specific objectives were: 1) to describe the approach to education, mode of delivery, and dose used in providing CABG patient education; and 2) to explore the extent to which variability in outcome achievement is associated with differences in the elements of educational interventions. The target population included adult patients who underwent CABG procedures.
