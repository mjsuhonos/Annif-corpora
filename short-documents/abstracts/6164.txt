The Dynamic Finite Element (DFE) formulation is a superconvergent, semianalytical method used to perform vibration analysis of structural components during the early stages of design. It was presented as an alternative to analytical and numerical methods that exhibit various drawbacks, which limit their applicability during the preliminary design stages. The DFE method, originally developed by the second author, has been exploited heavily to study the modal behaviour of beams in the past. Results from these studies have shown that the DFE method is capable of arriving at highly accurate results with a coarse mesh, thus, making it an ideal choice for preliminary stage modal analysis and design of structural components. However, the DFE method has not yet been extended to study the vibration behaviour of plates. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop a set of frequency-dependent, trigonometric shape functions for a 4-noded, 4-DOF per node element as a basis for developing a DFE method for thin rectangular plates. To this end, the authors exploit a distinct quasi-exact solution to the plate governing equation and this solution is then used to derive the new, trigonometric basis and shape functions, based on which the DFE method would be developed.
