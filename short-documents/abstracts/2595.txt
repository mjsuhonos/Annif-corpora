The Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs consists of 4820 photographs taken by photographer Arnold Newman between the years 1938 and 2004.  This thesis acts as a research project investigating the collection and making it accessible to researchers and collections management at the Art Gallery of Ontario.  The project includes research on the sitting subjects, an overview of the physical photographs, an annotated bibliography and the organization and housing of the collection for permanent accession into the Art Gallery of Ontario's photography collection.  The paper consists of an analytical portion which outlines the methodology of creating the finding aid.  The finding aid acts as a standalone paper designed to assist researchers navigating the collection.
