This paper examines the process of atonement beyond its religious significance as a powerful tool to rewire our brain, reconsider our old beliefs and establish new patterns of behaviors to improve our daily lives, repair relationships and live in harmony with ourselves and others. The work in this paper is based on self-exploration as well as a dive into the relevant scholarship with the overall goal of finding and sharing tools; and building road maps to help others heal themselves as well as relationships with others. The project relies primarily on personal exploration and a broad social media platform like Facebook to provide access to many others who can benefit from engaging with the topic and process of atonement
