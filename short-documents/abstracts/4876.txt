The gasified fluidized bed has been looked at as a safer replacement for heat treatment of carbon steel wire traditionally heat treated using molten lead baths. Most of the research has been conducted on heat transfer to larger diameter boiler tubes immersed in gas fluidized beds used by the power generation industry. However, there has been a lack of research on small diameter cylinders and longitudinally moving wire in heat treating systems. In 2015, Tannas developed a correlation that confirmed that the correlation previously developed for static wire under-predicts the heat transfer rate at higher wire speeds. In addition, this earlier correlation did not account for varying fluidization rates and only assumed that Nu was independent of fluidization rate for Ug/Umf > 2.5. So, the work reported here is intended to develop a new correlation that accounts for both wire motion and fluidizing rate in fluidized bed.
