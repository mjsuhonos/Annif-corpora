The purpose of this MRP is to explore the nature of Peak Experiences, which Maslow refers to as the combined response of the emotions, senses, intellect and imagination that are often experienced by people who have achieved self actualization.  Using the theatre as an environment that creates meaning and fulfillment and exploring the relationship between theatrical engagement experiences and digital media experiences, the goal of this paper is to determine how engagement practices between both media can function in harmony, in order to produce the hedonic experiences that Maslow describes.  This analysis is done by comparing various immersive theatre companies and interactive design companies who are pushing the boundaries of their fields and attempting to produce infectious and enlightening experiences in their area of expertise.
