The idea of informality in spaces is not a new concept, it is employed worldwide on a regular basis from something as simple as garage sale to a food truck moving to from place to place. Tactical urbanism draws from the idea of informality, through its attractive attributes (not permanent, limited resources necessary, any interested stakeholder can implement it and more), as short term solutions to drive change within communities. This research examines one tactical urbanism intervention in Brampton, Ontario to highlight the benefits and constraints of employing this method to drive change within the city. A review of the existing literature on tactical urbanism is used to aid in this analysis, and to compare to the case example ultimately, arriving at some recommendations for future the implementation of tactical urbanism interventions.
