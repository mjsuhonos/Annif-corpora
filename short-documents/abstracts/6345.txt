Many research works have been conducted on the behavior of composite slabs with profiled steel deck to study the longitudinal shear bond resistance using the m-k method. In this study, experimental investigations are conducted to evaluate the shear bond characeristics of composite slabs. 15 composite slabs are tested to study the effect of different high performance concrete (HPC) mixes namely engineered cementitious composites (ECC) and self-consolidating concrete (SCC), diverse profile sheets (with embossments or without embossments) and variable shear span on load-deflection characteristics, stress-strain development in concrete/steel, cracking/crack propagation and failure modes. The values of shear bond parameters (m and k) derived from the test results can be used for the design of composite slabs.
