The Toronto Argonauts are the oldest continuously running professional football team in North America and a storied franchise within the Canadian Football League. However, they are also a team facing vagrancy, with their lease at Rogers Centre expiring on December 31, 2017 and have historically had trouble-selling tickets at this locale. The team is now looking to play in a smaller established venue that is more realistic to fill and such stadiums suggested have included BMO Field and Varsity Centre. Therefore, the
research within this paper addresses the gap in the planning knowledge of which of these two stadiums should be chosen to move the team to from evaluations that include redevelopment cost, site location, accessibility, and a surrounding land use. The research highlights that Varsity Centre has the greatest potential, while also providing a set of recommendations for either site to optimize the potential to host the team.
