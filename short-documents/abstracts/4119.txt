Background: To examine the views and current practice of SMBG among Black Caribbean and South Asian
individuals with non-insulin treated Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods: Twelve participants completed semi-structured interviews that were guided by the Health Belief Model
and analyzed using thematic network analysis.

Results: The frequency of monitoring among participants varied from several times a day to once per week. Most
participants expressed similar experiences regarding their views and practices of SMBG. Minor differences across
gender and culture were observed. All participants understood the benefits, but not all viewed SMBG as beneficial
to their personal diabetes management. SMBG can facilitate a better understanding and maintenance of self-care
behaviours. However, it can trigger both positive and negative emotional responses, such as a sense of
disappointment when high readings are not anticipated, resulting in emotional distress. Health care professionals
play a key role in the way SMBG is perceived and used by patients.

Conclusion: While the majority of participants value SMBG as a self-management tool, barriers exist that impede its
practice, particularly its cost. How individuals cope with these barriers is integral to understanding why some
patients adopt SMBG more than others.
