    Investigations were conducted into the fortification and retention of Vitamin D3 in cheddar cheese, yogurt and ice cream. Two different formulations of vitamin D3 were used to fortify these products: a water-dispersible emulsion of vitamin D3 (Vitex D) and crystalline vitamin D3 dissolved in ethanol. A newly-developed extraction method followed by reverse phase High Pressure Liquid Chromatography analysis was used to assess vitamin D3 retention in these products. Stability studies of vitamin D3 in cheddar cheese aged for three months, in yogurt aged for one month, and in ice cream aged for one month were made. There were no significant differences in the recovery of vitamin D3 between the two formulations of vitamin D3 used in any of the products (P>0.05). The recovery of vitamin D3 in cheese, whey, yogurt and ice cream immediately after processing was 87-90%, 7-9%, 97-99% and 99-100% respectively. However, retention of vitamin D3 in cheese, yogurt and ice cream over the storage periods was 93-100%, 100-102% and 98-99% respectively. In conclusion, cheese, yogurt and ice cream were good vehicles for vitamin D3 fortification, using either form.
