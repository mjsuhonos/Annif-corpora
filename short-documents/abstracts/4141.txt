Water scarcity is inherently complex, yet it is a largely ignored and chronically
understudied problem in Canada. The country has a relative abundance of freshwater,
which has led to wasteful and inefficient use of water resources and high economic and
environmental costs. Responsibility to govern this precious resource is predominantly
in the power of the provinces in accordance with the 1982 Constitution Act. Alberta,
British Columbia and Ontario were selected as jurisdictions of study. Alberta’s Water
for Life Strategy, British Columbia’s Living Water Smart Strategy and Water
Sustainability Act, as well as Ontario’s Permit to Take Water Program are important
policy instruments in the prevention of scarcity. To contribute to policy improvements
for each of selected jurisdiction, policy recommendations and criteria for policy
evaluation were developed and applied, drawing on examples of challenges and
responses from selected international jurisdictions.
