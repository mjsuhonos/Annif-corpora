    This thesis investigates how geometry of complex objects is related to LIDAR scanning with the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) pose estimation and provides statistical means to assess the pose accuracy.  LIDAR scanners have become essential parts of space vision systems for autonomous docking and rendezvous.  Principal Componenet Analysis based geometric constraint indices have been found to be strongly related to the pose error norm and the error of each individual degree of freedom.  This leads to the development of several strategies for identifying the best view of an object and the optimal combination of localized scanned areas of the object's surface to achieve accurate pose estimation.  Also investigated is the possible relation between the ICP pose estimation accuracy and the districution or allocation of the point cloud.  The simulation results were validated using point clouds generated by scanning models of Quicksat and a cuboctahedron using Neptec's TriDAR scanner.
