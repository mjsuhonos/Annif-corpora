    The A356 Al-Si-Mg cast alloy is being used in the automotive industry to replace some heavy components due to its fabrication flexibility and high strength-to-weight ratio. This study was aimed at identifying cyclic deformation characteristics and fracture mechanisms of the A356 alloy in different material conditions. The microstructure consisted of primary a-Al matrix and eutectic regions containing Si particles of acicular (T5) and spherical (T6 and ModT6) morphologies. The ModT6 sample had a higher yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) but a lower strain hardening exponent than the T6 sample, while the T5 sample had a lower YS UTS but a higher initial strain hardening than the T6 sample. The T6 sample exhibited a higher cyclic hardening capacity and longer fatigue life. Crack initiation in both tensile and fatigue tests occurred at the sub-surface voids. Quasi-cleavage fracture characteristics in the T5 condition and dimple-like fracture features in the T6 and ModT6 were observed.
