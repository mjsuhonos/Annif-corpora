    According to a 2008 report by the Social Planning Council of Ottawa, many immigrants in Ottawa perceived schools to be a contributing factor to their sense of societal exclusion. It has been suggested that if teachers received more appropriate adequate teacher training, they could better help minimize problems of exclusion (Gerin-Lajoie, 2008a. 2008c; Abbate-Vaughn, 2008; Ghosh, 1996). This paper explores training topics that could promote the inclusion of immigrants in schools, while also questioning whether it is possible to assume that teacher training can have an impact. The opinions of three Ottawa-Carleton District School Board teachers are discussed. An examination of additional ways in which inclusion can be addressed is also provided.
