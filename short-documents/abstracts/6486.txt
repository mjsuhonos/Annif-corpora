In this report I tried to develop a model to control remanufacturing transportation cost for a reverse supply chain considering various serviceable and remanufacturable inventory stock points. While consumers traditionally dump the products at the end of their life cycle, there is an option to return them to the manufacturers for renew and reuse. As a result, manufacturers must collect products at the end of their life and control their recovery or disposal situation. Product recovery, which includes reusing, remanufacturing and recycling, requires a reverse logistic network in order to increase efficiently. This report presents the results of a simulation model for a reverse logistics network for collecting the returned cartridge toners from customers. Real data from an Australian case company was utilized to design test experiments in order to validate and evaluate the model.
