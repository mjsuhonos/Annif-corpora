Broadband Internet connectivity is currently seen as a means to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of an economy. The deployment and use of broadband capabilities is high on the current political agenda in many developed and developing countries, including Australia. But despite ongoing efforts to promote broadband in Australia, deployment has been much slower than expected. This paper aims to identify areas that have been holding up the broadband development in Australia. In examining four areas for attention (demand, competition, price and the role of government), we refer to experiences in Canada and Korea, both leaders in broadband deployment, to show the differences in each area. Although each country discussed here has its own policy agenda and some unique circumstances related to broadband deployment, implications from this paper will provide valuable input for policy makers and industry leaders in Australia (and elsewhere) as they develop strategies to encourage more widespread broadband deployment.
