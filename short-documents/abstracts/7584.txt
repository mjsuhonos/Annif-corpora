As progressive societies increasingly rely on digital technologies, our methods of communicating with
each other continue to evolve. While this opens up many possibilities for the formation of new
relationships, it also has repercussions with regard to our ability to maintain the relationships that
matter most. This paper and project aims to identify challenges experienced by couples in loving
relationships typically caused by or worsened by over-reliance on smartphones and social media. I have
proposed a design solution in the form of a mobile application made specifically for committed partners,
tentatively called Steady. The goal of the app is to encourage compassion, understanding and healthy
communication; helping couples be more engaged in face-to-face interaction and avoid being distracted
by their devices while spending time together.
