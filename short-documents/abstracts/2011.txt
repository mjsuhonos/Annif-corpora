    In this thesis, we attempt to solve the problem of WLAN/RFID coexistence and integration in frequency band of GHz or ISM band. Our solution to this problem is to allow the WLAN access and RFID access in a time-sharing manner by making the WLAN Access Point aware of the RFID neighbor-network at MAC layer. The time-sharing function is implemented using IEEE 802.11 PCF mechanism. RFID network is implemented using two different standards. The first one is Framed Slotted Aloha standard and the second one is IEEE 802.15.4 standard. We have simulated both models using Artifex simulator and compared their performance using some performance metrics like collision probability and average number of collision in each superframe. It is shown that IEEE 802.15.4 based model outperforms the Framed Slotted Aloha based model.
