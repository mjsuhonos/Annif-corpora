    In 2007 and 2008, George Eastman House acquired the photographs and negatives created between 1964 and 1980 by the photographer James Jowers. This paper describes an applied thesis project, the primary objective of which was to catalog and rehouse this collection of photographs and negatives, in order to facilitate access and use of the collection. It also summarizes the research conducted into the life and work of the previously little known Jowers. The paper presents a biography of Jowers, a timeline of his exhibitions and publications, and discusses his role in the New York photography world and the influence of other photographers, namely his teacher Lisette Model. This document is intended to be a useful resource for future researchers, and to promote further interest in the work of James Jowers.
