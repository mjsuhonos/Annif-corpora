This thesis consists of a proposal for an exhibition titled Focus: Architecture in Photographic Exhibitions 1858â€“1861. Drawn from the collection of almost three hundred nineteenth-century architectural photographs at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the exhibition explores the topic of architectural photographs exhibited between 1858 and 1861. This two-part thesis first approaches the exhibition from a practical side, outlining the steps in preparing the photographs for display. An essay follows, investigating the role of the Architectural Photographic Association in the context of the photographic market of this time. The thesis also includes appendices relating to various aspects of the exhibition design process, including an object checklist, matting and framing recommendations, condition reports, wall labels, wall elevations, and an informational brochure.
