Paul Lewis Anderson (American, 1880-1956) was a photographer, educator, and writer. His career began in earnest in 1909 and, with only one major interruption, he continued to photograph until 1953. During his lifetime, he wrote many articles and books on Pictorial photography and photographic techniques. He devoted his photographic work to Pictorialism. This thesis brings to light the 492 Paul Lewis Anderson photographs at George Eastman House by expanding access with a collection guide. This guide consists of vital information about Anderson and the photographs, explanations of the photographic processes Anderson used, a listing of the photographs according to box, examples of the inscriptions he used, and a selected bibliography for more information on Anderson.
