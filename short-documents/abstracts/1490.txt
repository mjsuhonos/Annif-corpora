    Mutual reinforcement and symbiosis can impose salutary design principles for architecture, creating more creative, interconnected, coherent and convivial cities across our planet. Symbiosis refers to the interrelationship between two or more facets of life, which are mutually beneficial or dependent on each other in a direct, indirect, visible or interpretive way. These benefits or dependencies may be metaphorical, physical in nature or philosophical interpretations of how two systems within our environment may be dependent on each other in order to exist.
