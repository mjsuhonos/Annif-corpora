    This paper reports on an interview study that was conducted by the author with executive directors representing 10 agencies in Toronto which provide supportive housing for those dealing with mental health and/or addiction issues. It provides a review of the literature and evidence with respect to such housing, and describes its origin, evolution and general characteristic in Toronto. It then focuses on discussing themes identified over the course of the interviews, in relation to overall system planning...and lack thereof. Alongside of expected but important themes, such as the desperate shortage of housing stock, a number of more subtle trends are uncovered. For example, the increasing imposition of concepts and practices from the hospital and private data management sectors, are proving troublesome for some supportive housing providers as they threaten their community and client centered values, beliefs, principles and practices.
