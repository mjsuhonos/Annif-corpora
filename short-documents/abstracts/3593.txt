Knowledge translation has been defined as the synthesis, dissemination, exchange and ethically-sound application of knowledge to improve health, resulting in a stronger health care system. This paper will describe the process of using an integrated knowledge translation approach to design a research protocol that will examine the effectiveness of a web-based patient educational intervention. It will begin with a description of integrative knowledge translation, followed by the presentation of a specific case example, in which integrative knowledge translation was used to develop a nursing intervention. The major elements of integrative knowledge translation that pertain to: need for a knowledge user, identification of the research approach, examination of study feasibility, and the presentation of outcomes will be addressed throughout this discussion.
