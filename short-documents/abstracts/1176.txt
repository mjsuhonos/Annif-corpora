    “Cosplay” (from kosupure, which combines the Japanese words for “costume” –コス– and “play” – プレ), is a term used to describe costume fandom, where individuals are costumed as fictional characters. The aim of this research was to develop a deeper understanding of North American cosplayers. Mixed methodology was used to collect and analyze demographic, behavioural, and creative data. In stage one, information was collected from 529 cosplayers in an online survey. In stage two, on-site ethnography was used to observe and gather data. In stage three, seven cosplayers participated in self-directed recording of their creation processes. This study has developed original demographic data on North American cosplayers. It has also explored the creative, emotional, social, and behavioural processes in which cosplayers participate while interpreting and constructing their characters, including the negotiation between fiction and reality, and the place of temporary identity.
