The concept of reconfigurability and its applications in robotics have become prominent in the past few years as they provide versatility, adaptability and scalability to the systems. The reconfigurable robots can perform tasks in outer space, under the sea and in hazardous environments by rearranging their physical configurations to alter the system’s behavior and geometry. However, the concept of reconfigurable robots is not just constrained by the mechanical reconfiguration of the components, for the system should also demonstrate a modular reconfigurable behavior to newly imposed conditions. 

The objective of this work was to design and implement a multi-modal reconfigurable platform based on the concept of “form follows function” to be integrated with 3D-Immersive telepresence systems. The developed system was analyzed to verify the feasibility and functionality of the proposed architecture, and suggestions were made for future improvements.
