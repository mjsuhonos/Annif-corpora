This research explores Canadian dress identity from 1985-2010 by analyzing editorial fashion images from Flare magazine. The study includes images produced before the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 and after the lapse of all protectionist legislation in 2003. A content analysis using dichotomous attributes on a seven-point scale was used to code data. Images from Vogue magazine were also coded to provide a point of comparison.

Analysis shows that Canadian fashion design is more conservative, practical, and subtly sexy than designs from other countries. It also incorporates some militaristic elements and a whimsical sense of humour. Canadian brand names are less recognized than international fashion brands and they are not as widely distributed within Canada. Significantly, the number of Canadian designs featured in Flare declined over the study period.
