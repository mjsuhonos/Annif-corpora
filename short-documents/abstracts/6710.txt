The purpose of this study was to determine if Canadian ENGOs are less opposed to the use of nuclear power in Ontario since 2001 and to determine if any changes are due in part to a ~ broader response to concerns over climate change. Analysis included interviews of fifteen ENGO employees from fourteen Ontario-based Canadian ENGOs and text analysis of nine ENGOs.
There is some evidence that some of the ENGOs studied have in fact softened their stance on nuclear power to become slightly less negatively disposed to the technology, but not more positively disposed. This analysis revealed evidence that two of the fourteen ENGOs may have become slightly more neutral in their references to nuclear power. However, only one of the two organizations shifted its stance due to the concerns over climate change and desire for
CO. 2 emissions reductions .
