    What makes a family? Diverse family configuration can take on a variety of unconventional forms; however government definitions decide who are fit for the privilege of recognition within legislative acts. Policy protects individuals and families who are established within the margins of political governance while others are excluded. For example, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/sexual and queer individuals and families rarely profit from their sporadic mention in Canada's legislation and experience a lack of visibility within early childhood education care settings. Furthermore, individuals who do not willfully pledge allegiance with the dominant culture's value system and create kinship outside the boundaries of heteronormative logic remain marginalized. The central question in this context begs for a theoretical argument as to why power is constructed and maintained as it is. Family identity discourse from a queer perspective could reform attitudes and policies where one form of family does not dominate over another.
