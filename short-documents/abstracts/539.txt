    In this thesis, a model is proposed to estimate the dynamic power dissipation of CMOS logic gate that is loaded with identical logic gates. The proposed model is based on parsitic capacitance, input capacitance and input-to-output coupling capacitance of the gate. Also, model takes into account transistor width and has a second order relation with fanout. Using 0.13um CMOS technology and netlist (Cadence), basic logic gates are designed and loaded by identical basic logic gates. Basic logic gates dynamic power are simulated and compared with the calculated values of proposed model over a range of transistor sizes and capacitive load condition. The proposed model shows a good agreement with the simulated value of dynamic power dissipation of basic logic gates that are loaded by identical basic logic gates.
