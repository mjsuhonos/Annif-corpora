This thesis presents a novel interaction model for browsing complex 3D scenes containing numerous layers of occluding and intertwining structures that often hide regions of interest. The interaction model is realized through the development of a custom visualization application, Aperio. Aperio provides a set of virtual mechanical "metal" tools, such as rods, rings, "cookie" cutters and a knife, that support real-time, interactive exploration. Cutter tools are designed to create easily-understood cutaway views (or context-preserving ribbon slices) and rings and rods provide simple path constraints that support rigid transformations of models via "sliding", providing interactive exploded-view capabilities. All tools are based on a single underlying superquadric formulation and can ―"iteratively" be picked up and replanted to generate various views. A multi-pass, GPU-based capping algorithm provides real-time "solid cuts" rendering of surface meshes. We also present a user study to provide supporting evidence of Aperio‘s interaction simplicity and effectiveness for occlusion management.
