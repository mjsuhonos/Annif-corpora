    The travelling solvent method known as TSM is a process used to produce pure and homogeneous crystals. The TSM process has been tested on many alloys producing uniform and uncontaminated crystal products. A three-dimensional numerical simulation for the growth of Ge1-xSix by the travelling solvent method under axial rotation has been modelled. In this model a mesh sensitivity analysis has been carried out to find an optimum mesh which provides accurate results while saving computational time, The full Navier-Stokes equations together with the energy, mass transport and continuity equations were solved numerically using the finite element technique. The application of crucible rotation to the travelling solvent method is an attempt to control the buoyancy induced convection throughout the melt and to suppress the three-dimensional characteristics of unsteady heat flow. The application of different rotational speeds on the solvent has also been investigated. These different speeds of rotation were shown to have a considerable effect on the buoyancy induced flow. The solute distribution throughout the melt was also affected substantially. Taking these two factors into account plays a crucial role in the crystal growth process. The speed of rotation was found to have a significant effect on the intensity of the convective flow in the melt and an optimal rotational speed was encountered.
