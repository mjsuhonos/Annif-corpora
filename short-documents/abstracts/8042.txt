Contemporary architectural discourse continues to use humanist definitions of the user leading to incompatible built interfaces. This thesis speculates on what potential modalities arise when we radically shift our understanding of the user from that of the Human to the Posthuman. The museum is utilized as a typology to explore the conceptual framework of a Posthuman user for the development of an architectural system. By approaching the museum as an infrastructural network rather than an insulated boundary condition we can begin to understand the emergent networks and autonomous processes that constitute contemporary built ecologies. Design systems that are developed through a Posthuman perspective begin to engender design ecologies that operate through autonomous states in collaboration with artifacts, actors, and interfaces.
