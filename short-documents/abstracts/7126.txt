The size of visually-impaired population in the world is large. They usually have a better hearing than normal people, but the lack of vision prevents them from enjoying video games. Audio games, as the main output of the type of game is sound, naturally become a game genre that visually-impaired people can play. The project designed and developed a rhythm audio game for visually-impaired people. The game has been successfully tested for different songs.
