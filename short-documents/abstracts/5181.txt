This study examines the programs and policies of two Ontario library systems to determine in what ways their strategies support the social inclusion of newcomers. Through interviews with library administrators and librarians in the Toronto and Windsor Public Libraries, issues surrounding the development and delivery of programs to newcomers to Canada are explored. Interview findings are used to highlight best practices, and to make recommendations designed to address current barriers to and gaps in service provision. Theories of social inclusion and acculturation, outlining stages of immigrant integration, are used to analyze the newcomer services of public libraries and their importance in the process of settlement. This study highlights the challenges faced by Canadian public institutions in responding to the needs of newcomers.
