Trying to wrap one’s head around Canada’s rapid (and frequently changing) immigration system can leave you breathless (Alboim & Cohl, 2012). From temporary entry limitations, to new citizenship legislation, and increased ministerial powers, immigration policy changes have continuously been reshaping Canada’s future. During a House of Commons session in late 2013, Ms. Maria Welbourne, Senior Director of Strategic Policy and Planning of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, provided an overview of an Expression of Interest (EOI) model approach, a modernization initiative which was coming to Canada to facilitate a faster (and more flexible) immigration system (House of Commons, 2013). Fast forward just over one year later and the EOI model, already in place in New Zealand and Australia, is in full effect as Canada’s new Express Entry system (Bellissimo, 2014). While chatter and speculation of the now fully-automated electronic application management system existed prior to its inception, the discussion since the January 1, 2015 start date has grown, raising many questions as to whether this new system will in fact achieve Canada’s economic objectives, primarily reducing application backlogs and coordinating application volume, and selecting those immigrant candidates who are expected to meet Canada’s economic needs (Richard, 2014).
