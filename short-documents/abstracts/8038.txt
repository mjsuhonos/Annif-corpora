This study analyzes the role of grassroots organizations in the Greater Toronto Area who support newcomers to Canada. A qualitative thematic analysis was used, with staff from three grassroots organizations and two key informants participating. The study aims, first, to gather practical knowledge from these organizations about the actions needed to improve settlement outcomes for newcomers. Secondly, it seeks to learn what challenges grassroots organizations face in continuing and expanding their services, and how they can be supported in their work. The organizations of focus do not provide direct, government-funded settlement services, but work towards goals of long-term immigrant success and integration. Findings included the need for more responsive and culturally-relevant programming among settlement organizations, the challenges with attaining funding, and the importance of partnerships among related institutions. These actors have valuable insights on newcomersâ€™ current settlement needs and can make important knowledge contributions to the settlement sector.
