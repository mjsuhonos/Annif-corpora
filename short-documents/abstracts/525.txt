    This thesis is based on the initial phase of a project that developed an in-depth collision database and performed an analysis of police reported side-impact collisions for the City of Toronto intersections between 1998 and 2000. Currently, collision data exists through several different sources in Ontario. The development of a database involving the amalgamation of collision forms, the selection of data fields, and the collection of real collision data from selected, thoroughly investigated side impact collisions involving late model vehicles (1998 and newer), is described. For analysis, Statistical Analysis Software Release 8.02 was used to investigate causation and causal factors of side impact collisions. Statistically significant collision factors determined by fault propensity included apparent driver action, driver age, front seat passenger age, maximum posted speed, approximate vehicle speed, road character, and number of lanes. For intersection collision propensity, statistically significant findings included the system used, presence of flashing signals, intersection legs, roadway volume, and intersection leg road classifications. It is anticipated that the findings from this analysis can provide insight into significant factors in side-impact collisions that will be applied with greater focus to the in-depth collision database, once developed.
