This thesis includes theoretical and practical components. The theoretical part examines sixteen Russian photographic albums produced during the First World War. The albums form a part of the Art Gallery of Ontario’s (AGO) photography collection related to the First World War. In Part I, a literature survey, methodology
section and historical chapter provide essential contextual and historical information about the objects. Part II consists of four essays that analyze the albums, divided into four groups. Based on the author’s translation of the available captions and her interpretation of the visual information found in the albums, the essays demonstrate how the critical events of Russian history during the period from 1910 to the 1920s are reflected through the photographs in these personal albums. The practical part of the thesis (Part III) provides a sampling of cataloguing records on an item level for the two Hospital Train albums in Appendix A and updated cataloguing records for all sixteen albums in Appendix B.
