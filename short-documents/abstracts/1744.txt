    There exists a lack of public funding or political authority within the 21st century North American city for the creation of public space. In the absence of this authority, architecture can resist being merely a commodity for global profit and become an agent for the creation of public space through built form. While this is a topical idea in architectural discourse, through synthesized research intocontemporary urbanisms and by way of several architectural projects that explore public space, this thesis proposes an alternative methology to the conventions of framing public space through the horizontal deformation of a building. This thesis places public space as the hierarchal organizing figure for urban architecture and proposes a new connective public domain that might operate more like the Nolli Map in section rather than in plan.
