The health of Canadian university students has been recognized as a public health concern, with sleep identified as one of the three most problematic areas. Of Canadian postsecondary students, 75.6% report obtaining an insufficient amount of sleep. Cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been found to be highly effective for the treatment of insomnia in the general population, including self-help administration of CBT-I. Due to a dearth of professionals trained in administering CBT-I, this study examined whether a self-help CBT-I program for young adult students would be a feasible method of improving sleep in this population. On quantitative measures, completers of the program (N = 18) demonstrated adequate knowledge acquisition, and they rated the program as acceptable, easy to understand, satisfactory, and useful. According to the qualitative data, completers found the program to be useful, clear, and easy to understand.
