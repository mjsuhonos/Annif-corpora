    This thesis investigates the concept of liminality and how it may be represented in architectural design. Architectural design of liminal space can augment spatial experiences and lead to self-awareness in relation to self, space and the environment.
    Liminality is a journey of different moments which can influence a person to discover something new about themselves and the world around them. A design proposal of a bridge at Bayfront Park, Hamilton, is presented as an architectural representation of a liminal experience.
    One of the challenges of this thesis and in the understanding of the concept of liminality is that different states are experienced differently by individuals. A liminal journey within the context of Bayfront Park may lead to a better sense of one's awareness in relation to themselves, the space they are in and  the environment that surrounds them.
