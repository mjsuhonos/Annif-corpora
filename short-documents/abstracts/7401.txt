[Paragraph 1 of Introduction]:  Although women make up more then half of Canada’s volunteers, and a large number of voluntary organizations are exclusively female, there has been little research focussing on women’s voluntary organizations. The purpose of this study is to correct this neglect by surveying 351 women’s voluntary organizations (as defined in the Methods section), and comparing them to 294 voluntary organizations that do not fall into the category of women’s organizations. Specifically, we investigate the responses of these voluntary organizations to the changes wrought by the neo-conservative political philosophy that has replaced the social democratic liberalism of the post-war era (see McBride and Shields, 1997).
