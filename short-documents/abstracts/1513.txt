    The objective of this thesis is to report the single vibration mode standing wave tubular piezoelectric ultrasonic motors developed. Piezoelectric motors are driven by reverse piezoelectric effects which converts an input of ultrasonic frequency of electrical energy into an output of mechanical movement. There are many advantages of piezoelectric ultrasonic motors compared to electromagnetic motors such as simple structure, high energy density, and high torque at low speed. Three prototypes are designed and fabricated. Two motors are fabricated using PZT cylindrical tube; one with PZT teeth and the other with metal teeth. A third motor using brass tube with PZT plates attached is fabricated. After design and fabrication of three prototypes, the performances of the motors are tested using a test apparatus for speed and torque.
