The rutting models in the AASHTO Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) have been calibrated to Ontarioâ€™s conditions for flexible pavements of Marshall mixes, and have yet to be calibrated for the Superpave materials. This study differs from previous studies in several counts: First, the local calibration database included both Superpave and Marshall mixes. Second, two of the five local calibration parameters (the temperature and traffic exponents) were pre-fixed based on a secondary study of the NCHRP 719 report. Third, both cross-sectional and longitudinal calibrations were performed and compared. It was concluded that the Superpave and Marshall mix pavements should be separately treated in the local calibration and that the cross-sectional and longitudinal calibrations behaved drastically differently in terms of residual errors. A set of local calibration parameters were recommended for future pavement design. It was recommended that trench investigations be done to further validate the results from the study.
