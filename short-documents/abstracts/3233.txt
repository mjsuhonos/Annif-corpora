The multifaceted acoustic environments found in Toronto's urban centres are often unseen as part of the city's cultural landscape. Toronto's ambience is a direct product of the cultural fertility created in downtown communities however, certain consumptive practices are encroaching on a vulnerable soundscape. Technology is changing the cityscape, not only visually but acoustically as well. As a result, consumer culture is adapting. In the past, consumption revolved around the visual realm. Now a change is occurring, consumerism is evolving, and soundscapes are facilitating a new era of consumer culture. It is essential that we realise this shift and that we do not remain passive observers in what is considered to be an evolution from a literary to aural society.
