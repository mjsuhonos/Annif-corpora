    The high frequencies range, inductively coupled Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems are widely used for product identification. The effectiveness of RFID systems diminishes near metals. The objective of this work was to investigate how the magnetic field values were affected by the metallilc disc, and how the physical parameters of the metal impact the electromagnetic values. The RFID system simulation models consisting of a deader coil, a circular metallic disc and a tag coil were developed using COMSOL software. The flux at different positions over the disc was compared to the flux at the same positions when the disc was not present, for discs of different radius and thickness. For models developed, the ratio of electric field when metal is present to electric field when metal is not present increased away from the metal. The radius and position where values are recorded impact the value of the magnetic field notably.
