    In abrasive jet micromachining (AJM), a jet of particles is passed through narrow mask openings in order to define the features to be micro-machined. The size and shape of the micro-machined features depends on the distribution of the particle velocity and mass flux through the mask openings. In this work, a high speed laser shadowgraphy technique was used to demonstrate experimentally, for the first time, the significant effect of the mask opening size and powder shape and size on the resulting distribution of particle mass flux and velocity through the mask opening. In particular, it was found that the velocity through the mask was approximately constant, but different in magnitude than the velocity in the free jet incident to the mask. The measured mass flux distributions were in excellent agreement with a previously developed analytical model, thus directly confirming its validity. Additional measurements also showed that an existing numerical model could be used to predict the velocity distribution in free jets of spherical particles, and, if a modification to the particle drag coefficient is made, in free jets of angular particles. The direct experimental verification of these models allow for their use in surface evolution models that can predict the evolving shape of features micro-machined using AJM.
