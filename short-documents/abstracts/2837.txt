The Live-in Caregiver program provides a gendered pathway to permanent residency in Canada for women who are internationally trained nurses. Upon attaining permanent residency and open work permits, internationally trained nurses can become registered members with the College of Nurses of Ontario, which will allow them to re-enter the nursing profession. However, in light of recent amendments to the registration regulation by the College of Nurses of Ontario issues of unequal treatment for international applicants arise. This paper examines the regulation of the Live-in Caregiver Program, and the recent amendments to the registration regulation by the College of Nurses of Ontario, to present the systemic oppression and discrimination which creates barriers for internationally trained nurses to their transition from caregiving to nursing in Ontario. Conclusions state that amendments to the regulatory policies must occur to eliminate the inequalities against internationally trained nurses.
