The rapid pace at which the climate is changing has forced governments globally to focus on adaptation techniques for their built environment.  This paper will define and explain Ontario's current management framework over its building portfolio and identify gaps in planned adaptation strategies and recommend solutions to fill these gaps.  This research will be informed by current literature that details the most appropriate and successful approaches to managing a building portfolio in the face of climate change.  Recommendations will be made as to how Ontario's public infrastructure frameworks and strategic approaches can be modified to embody a more holisitic, realistic and result-based approach to built form adaptation.
