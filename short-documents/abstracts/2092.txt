    This thesis envisions a successful intensification of Toronto avenues, using the vehicle of  newly formulated design guidelines for higher-density, mixed-use, mid-rise built form. The aim of this thesis is to invigorate development along Toronto's historically relevant yet often contested main streets, in a way that recognizes infrastructure as a defining element for culturally and economically sustainable urban development.
