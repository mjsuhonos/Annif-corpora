    The study investigated the consumer behaviors, shopping patterns, and consumer satisfaction of female baby boomers. With a specific focus on the Canadian retail market, the study first surveyed women born between the years of 1946 and 1964 to obtain market research and data that will further aid in a smaller focus group. As boomers enter into their fifties and sixties, there is a growing disconnect between what a boomer wants and what is available to them on the market. The study provides strategies for product sourcing by determine what fit, fabrics, and styles of clothing that boomer women want, and whether or not they are satisfied with what is available to them on the market. The results are beneficial to both consumer and retailer in understanding clothing preferences.
