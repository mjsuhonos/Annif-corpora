This thesis project focuses on a photographic collection of the multidisciplinary artist, Michael Snow (Canadian, b. 1929 - ), which is currently in the artist’s possession and has not been previously studied. The collection includes over 5,000 photographic materials related to Snow’s photo-works and his work in other media. The term photo-work is used in this thesis to appropriately reflect the intermedia character of Snow’s photographic compositions.                                         
 The first chapter explores Snow’s artistic career and photo-work. Chapter two overviews cataloguing standards in Canada, discusses issues in photographic deterioration, and outlines proper storage techniques. Chapter three discusses the cataloguing process of Snow’s photographic collection, including information about the present condition of these materials, and provides recommendations for its future acquisition and potential use. This thesis argues that insight into an artist’s practice is an important part of the cataloguing process, particularly for collections with materials related to the production and/or documentation of intermedia works. With this knowledge, objects can be better identified and understood in relation to the collection to which they belong and the artist’s overall body of work.
