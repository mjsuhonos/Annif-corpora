Ontario, Canada’s cap and trade program, a provincial tool for carbon regulation, came into effect January 1, 2017. While larger companies are targeted from this policy, both large and small companies have a responsibility to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Craft brewing in Ontario is growing, however industry GHGs have not been comprehensively studied. The purpose of this research is to measure the GHGs of an Ontario craft brewery, investigate the challenges and benefits to calculating GHGs, and evaluate Ontario craft brewers’ perceptions of carbon pricing policy. This research found that indirect sources account for the majority of GHGs, particularly from barley agriculture, malted barley transportation, and bottle production. Direct emissions account for the least GHGs. This research found that the main challenges in calculating Ontario brewery GHGs are secondary data availability, technical knowledge, and finances. The main benefits for breweries include sustainability marketing, and preserving the environment.
