In Canada, studies show there are changing demographics increasing the population, the
disability rate, and the aging population. This significantly impacts people and their interactions
within the built environment. Currently, there are many buildings meeting minimum accessibility
standards, though they continuously create poorly designed and inaccessible buildings to all.
Thus, integrating Inclusive Design (ID) allows for full participation within society. This prevents
discrimination and stigmatization. ID is an intervention respecting differences, associated with
gender, race, religion, as well as age and ability, by accommodating diverse needs of various
groups of people. This approach incorporates three design strategies, including visual, nonvisual,
and social aspects enhancing the concept of ID. They are accessible experience while
traversing in architecture as communication, responsive and adaptable environment through
multi-sensory experience, and secure architecture for social interaction. As a result, an inclusive
environment is created addressing equity and equality, which benefit everyone enhancing self-dignity, independence, and well-being.
