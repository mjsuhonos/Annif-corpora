This project conceptualizes and creates a series of multi-sensory art installations for public and private musical / sound experiences, exploring conversations in augmented / generative art, synesthesia and digital trespassing.
At the intersection of the digital and physical world, how can reframing and layering physical landscapes with digital soundscapes educate, inform, delight, and elicit conversations about a world that has not been experienced before?
Making reference to contemporary technology and documenting the creative / constructive process, the direction of this inquiry explores how a multi-sensory and generative artistic approach can create strong crossovers from one sense to inform another.
