    The thesis presents a Genetic Algorithm with Adaptive Search Space (GAASS) proposed to improve both convergence performance and solution accuracy of traditional Genetic Algorithms(GAs). The propsed GAASS method has bee hybridized to a real-coded genetic algorithm to perform hysteresis parameters identification and hystereis invers compensation of an electromechanical-valve acuator installed on a pneumatic system. The experimental results have demonstrated the supreme performance of the proposed GAASS in the search of optimum solutions.
