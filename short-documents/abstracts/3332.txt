Promotion of renewable energy sources is associated with relieving climate change and energy security issues.  In this context, solar energy is one of the most suitable renewable energy technologies to be technically viable to support a sustainable and renewable energy industry in Ontario, supported by a feed-in tariff (FIT) policy program.  The purpose of this thesis was to develop an integrated assessment of the likely effectiveness and sustainability performance of Ontario's FIT solar PV  program using a qualitative analysis through an international comparative policy analysis and a set of criteria evaluation; and a quantitative analysis using an economic evaluation of the solar PV value chain in Ontario to obtain the resulting costs/benefits to the province using the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LSCA) framework and the cost-benefit approach.  Based on the results of the integrated evaluation, renewable energy policy implications will be determined including the effectiveness of regulatory incentives.
