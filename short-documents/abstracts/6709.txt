For the purpose of autonomous satellite grasping, a high-speed, low-cost stereo vision system is required with high accuracy. This type of system must be able to detect an object and estimate its range. Hardware solutions are often chosen over software solutions, which tend to be too slow for high frame-rate applications. Designs utilizing field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) provide flexibility and are cost effective versus solutions that provide similar
performance (i.e., Application Specific Integrated Circuits). This thesis presents the architecture and implementation of a high frame-rate stereo vision system based on an FPGA platform. The system acquires stereo images, performs stereo rectification and generates disparity estimates at frame-rates close to 100 fpSi and on a large-enough FPGA, it can process 200 fps. The implementation presents novelties in performance and in the choice of the algorithm implemented. It achieves superior performance to existing systems that estimate scene depth. Furthermore, it demonstrates equivalent accuracy to software implementations of the dynamic programming maximum likelihood stereo correspondence algorithm.
