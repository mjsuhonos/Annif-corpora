Recognition of the multi-cultural nature of the Canadian population has led many companies across a wide array of business domains to consider ways of reaching beyond their traditional bases of support to target hitherto untapped ethnic communities. Market conditions within the voluntary sector are pushing nonprofits along this same path. Unfortunately, there is no systematic Canadian research on the attitudes, social norms, benefits sought, expectations, opportunities, experiences or behaviours of ethnic communities in the voluntary sector. This paper contributes to this gap by looking at philanthropic behaviour by visible minority status
