A new Ontario-based glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bar manufacturer developed high-modulus (HM) GFRP bars with headed ends for use in bridge construction. This thesis presents a structural qualification procedure to qualify the use of the developed GFRP bars in concrete bridge barriers-deck joint. The thesis is comprised of two phases. The first phase includes an experimental program to investigate the pullout capacity of the GFRP bar anchorage in normal strength concrete. In phase two, three sets of full-scale TL-5 barrier wall-deck system of 900 mm length were cast and tested to-collapse. The first set incorporated headed-end GFRP bars to connect the barrier wall to a deck slab cantilever for better pre-installed anchorage. The second set is identical to the first set but for non-deformable thick deck slab. The third set incorporated post-installed GFRP bars in non-deformable thick deck slab using a commercial epoxy adhesive. Experimental capacities of the tested specimen were then correlated with factored applied moments given by the 2006 Commentaries of the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code and available equations in the literature. Based on the experimental findings, conclusions and recommendations were drawn.
