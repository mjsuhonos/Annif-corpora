Despite the success that programmable devices have enjoyed in the last two decades, architecture synthesis methodologies for Run-Time Reconfigurable (RTR) systems are still in their infancy. As the majority of consumer devices integrate multiple-functionality, the cost-effectiveness becomes the main focus of computing systems design. This thesis presents a novel architecture synthesis methodology for the cost-effective implementation of a multi-task and multi-mode workload. The proposed methodology creates a RTR system that changes its functionality in response to a dynamic environment and enables on-chip assembly of pre-constructed components by synthesizing a workload-specific static architecture. The proposed methodology presents novelties in design abstraction, partitioning method and in the procedure of deciding reconfiguration granularity. The experimental results show the cost benefits of the proposed architecture synthesis methodology saving 73% of area and 29.8% of power compared to fixed design approach
