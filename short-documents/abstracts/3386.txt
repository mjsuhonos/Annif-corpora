The impacts of biosolids land application on soil phosphorus and subsequent transfer to aquatic ecosystems in the condition of the minimal slope were assessed. Soil, representing typical "Non response" Ontario soil, was amended with anaerobically digested biosolids at a rate of 8 tonnes/ha. Over five months, soil samples from two different depths were sequentially fractionated to determine various inorganic and organic phosphorus pools in order to evaluate phosphorus vertical migration within a soil profile. Soil leachate was analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus and added to the aquariums mimicking receiving surface waters. Water from aquariums was tested for the presence of eutrophication. The results indicated that biosolids application did not significantly affect phosphorus concentrations in soil and did not cause phosphorus vertical migration. The concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus also were not affected by biosolids. No signs of eutrophication were observed in receiving waters.
