A lack of provincial standardization for social media use by Ontario police officers has
limited the progression and success of community policing among young populations. The
abundant success of police-youth communications in-person is evident in studies from studies by
Anderson et al. (2007), Hinds (2007), and Leroux & McShane (2017); these results suggests that
increased social media communications between youth and officers would prove beneficial.
However, the barrier between the community policing principles outlined in Ontarioâ€™s
Mobilization and Engagement Model (MEM) and actual police practice echo structural issues
that have plagued Ontario policing for decades. Recent literature from Hawkes (2016) and earlier
literature from Leighton (1991) demonstrate the ongoing struggle to translate theory into
practice. Combining a qualitative content analysis of Twitter data alongside semi-structured
interviews with police officers, this study identified MEM strategies used by officers on social
media, as well as additional strategies introduced by officers on an individual basis. Findings
indicate that there are inconsistencies between officer perceptions of their communications with
youth and that of their actual practice. The discovery of four additional strategies used to
accomplish community policing on social media suggests that the MEM should be restructured to accommodate for technological advances. Officer social media use varied but a strong
commonality included the fear of damaged reputation or job loss-- indicating a greater need for
standardization to instill confidence in officer social media use. While provincial standardization
would benefit officers, it should not be restrictive as humanistic elements such as information
dissemination and personalization derived from officer freedom on social media were most often
noted as beneficial to both officers and youth.
