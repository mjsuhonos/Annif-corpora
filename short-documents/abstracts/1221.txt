    "Guided by James Frideres’ model of integration and Pierre Bourdieu’s theoretical approach to capital, this paper examines the factors that contributed to the upward mobility of some skilled immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area. An examination of the literature on the phenomenon of the “glass ceiling” reveals that skilled immigrants’ integration into the workplace is multidimensional, and cannot be achieved without the accumulation of different forms of capital necessary for advancement. The empirical research of this study captured the participants’ professional experiences that led them to develop an intercultural communication competence, which became a fundamental component to their career development. Based on this finding, I offer a new conceptual model of integration into the workplace that can be achieved through the accumulation of intercultural communication and identity forms of capital. The paper advances recommendations for an in-depth investigation of the impact of formal and informal training, in the host country, on skilled immigrants’ upward mobility. Keywords: Intercultural communication, career advancement, skilled immigrants, forms of capital, Greater Toronto area."
