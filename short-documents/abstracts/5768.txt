Morphogenesis defines the schema of natural material formations as a set of merging self-organized behaviours, rules, relative forces, and limits of materialization that analytically characterize a spatial arrangement within a specific environment for achieving an equilibrium state. However, in architecture, material organization, which acts as a threshold to space, has always been treated as a secondary component in design processes. This attitude has reduced the capability to generate an architecture that is intelligently aware of its functionality and of its environment. Transforming computational models of biological systems into the computational logic of material organization found in architecture would produce an architecture that is a product of full interactions between those material logics and space. This inquiry elaborates a set of biological computational frameworks to cultivate stratified developments of knowledge-based architectural prototypes of complex hybrid-structure material morphologies as contextual schemata
