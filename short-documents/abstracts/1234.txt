    This thesis presents experimental studies of vibration of a straight beam and a thin plate in axial pipe flow. Dynamic behaviors of the two structures are investigated for a wide range of mean flow velocities. Responses of the structures were measured and analyzed in the time and frequency domains with an aim to understand the fluid-solid interactions. The experimental results reveal that high mean flow velocities can excite higher vibration modes because of turbulence.
