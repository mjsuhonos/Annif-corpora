This research examines three case studies of transportation projects within the North American context including: the Eglinton Crosstown LRT in Toronto, St. Clair Streetcar reconstruction in Toronto, and the Central Corridor LRT in Minnesota to determine how planners can utilize planning policy and financial policy tools to offer solutions to help mitigate the social costs of transportation infrastructure projects for the affected communities. Results indicate that community benefits agreements and grants can be effective planning policy and financial policy tools that could be used to help mitigate the negative impacts of Light Rail Transit construction. Results also indicate that clear evaluative frameworks must be established, including clear targets, thresholds, reporting, and compliance in order for community benefits agreements to be considered successful.

Key words: community benefits agreements; light rail transit; transportation; construction; social costs
