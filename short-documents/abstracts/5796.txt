This research project investigated the potential in using a Wi‐Fi sensor network composed of Open Mesh
sensor nodes to measure both localized and non‐localized occupants in the Architecture Building at Ryerson University with two different sensor node configurations. It also experimented with the use of Raspberry Pi, a low‐cost infrared motion sensor, as a people counter. The results show that the proposed sensor network is not capable of measuring non‐localized (transient) occupants due to their short duration of stay in the measurement area. The number of non‐localized occupants and their duration of stay can be more accurately measured by the people counter. As for localized (in one location for longer periods) occupants, the results find that while the proposed system cannot provide an accurate occupant count, it can produce a fairly accurate overall occupancy pattern under both perimeter node and single node configurations
