    In wireless communication, speech is an essential service for which low rate speech coding is a key technique. Reducing the transmission bandwith and achieving higher speech quality are primary concerns in developing new speech coding algorithms. This report develops a joint channel and source controlled adaptive variable bit-rate algorithm to achieve a high speech quality and maintain an efficient spectrum.
