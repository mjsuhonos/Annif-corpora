    A simplified model was developed to predict the radiative and convective heat transfer in complex fenestration systems, including the effect of solar radiation. The focus of the current work was on Venetian blinds mounted adjacent to the indoor window surface. From the perspective of convection, the model used a convective flat plate flow between the blind and ambient surroundings and a convective channel flow between the window and blinds. It was necessary to develop new empirical correlations to predict the average channel Nusslet numbers of the hot and cold walls separately.
    Therefore, a CFG study of free convection in an asymmetrically heated channel was performed. Then, the new empirical correlations were used to develop a simplified one-dimensional model of the heat transfer in the system. The radiative heat exchange between the blind, window and room was calculated using a four surface grey-diffuse model. Sample predicted results were compared with existing experimental and numerical data from the literature.
