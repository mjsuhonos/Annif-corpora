    The hypereutectic Aluminum-Silicon (Al-Si) Alloys are gaining impetus in the automotive components, mainly due to their wear resistance. This property in these alloys is derived from the primary silicon crystals. However, there are unique metal flow and mold filling problems associated with hypereutectic Al-Si alloys in Lost Foam Casting (LFC). This investigation is a pioneering work undertaken to gain a better understanding of the role of primary silicon crystals and other phases in the LFC of hypereutectic Al-Si alloys.
    Time-temperature and first derivative curves were used to determine velocity of metal flow and to calculate solid fractions. Process parameters such as superheat, gating design and alloy composition were manipulated to change the morphology of primary silicon crystals. Microscopy and image analysis of castings enabled study of precipitated particles. Solidification, interlocking and melt sluggishness of precipitated particles significantly influenced fluidity, and the routine process parameters played a minor role.
