    This thesis is about the architecture of change. Weather, in the context of this thesis, acts as the agent of change and contingencies in organizing and modifying the built environment. It is a study of weather as the energy and matter in the atmosphere that directly affects the external organizations of the building, as well as the internal organizations of the userâ€™s experience. These organizations define architecture as a process through time; a performance-based construct that evolves with the actions and events of its surroundings. This thesis argues that weather can be used to enhance the experience and awareness of architecture.
