The purpose of this poster is to provide insight into the processes involved in creating an interdisciplinary online exhibition focused on a unique chapter of Canadian history from World War I. The exhibition focuses on the Colebourn Family Archive comprising digitized photographs and ephemera of Canadian soldier and veterinarian Harry Colebourn (1887–1947) who purchased a pet bear named Winnie who later became A. A. Milne’s inspiration for the classic Winnie-the-Pooh children's book series
