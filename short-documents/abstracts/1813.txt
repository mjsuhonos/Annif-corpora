    The journey of aging is often accompanied by a loss of autonomy as a result of the decline of the physiological capacity of the human body, as well as the inefficient integration of architecture, urbanism and Universal Design for the purpose of providing a built environment with the capacity to respond to the shift in human needs. Autonomy, I believe, can be achieved for the elderly when architecture synthesizes the elements of perception on the visual and the sensorial levels with the elements of action on the physiological level in the same experience.
