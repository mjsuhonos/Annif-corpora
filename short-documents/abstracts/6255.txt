The primary objective of this research paper is to identify and understand the potential impacts of growth management regulations (the Greenbelt Plan and the GPGGH) on housing affordability in the Town of Markham and to explore what, if anything, Markham is doing to mitigate potential negative impacts. Relevant quantitative  and qualitative data was reviewed relative to growth management and the Town of Markham and it was found that there are some potential links. Despite finding potential links, it is impossible to make a definitive and causal relationship between the two due to the discrepancies in measuring affordability and myriad variables that have the potential to influence affordability.
