Increasing evidence shows that punitive discipline is ineffective and detrimental. Using the theory and the opportunity-to-learn conceptual framework, this literature review seeks to broaden school personnelâ€™s knowledge of alternative discipline interventions. Searching ERIC and JSTOR databases, we looked for English language, North  American literature published between 1996 and 2016 that discussed alternative individual and school-wide disciplinary approaches. The literature we found indicates that punitive measures are counter-productive; that several alternative disciplinary models share common principles; and that studies point to favourable outcomes of some alternative school discipline models. While the transition towards alternative discipline may require additional resources and years of adjustment, a healthier school climate can foster the empowerment and academic achievement of marginalized students.
