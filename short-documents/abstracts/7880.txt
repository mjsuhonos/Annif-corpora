A gap between the personal understanding decolonization and the academic definitions of decolonization was identified through oral history interviews, so this research shares the unique stories of eight
Canadian indigenous women through fashion as a way to inform a more accessible and embodied definition of decolonization.                                                                                                                                                                                   The participants took part in a fashion-hacking workshop to began to answer the questions: What does the lived experience of decolonization look and feel like for Indigenous women?
