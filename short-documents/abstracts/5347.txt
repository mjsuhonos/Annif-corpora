This major research paper explores the use of gamification mechanics and procedural rhetoric to engage loyalty program communities on social media. In doing so, this study investigates the influences of online communities, the applications of gamification mechanics and procedural rhetoric, as well as the role and agency of consumers. A quantitative content analysis was used to analyze a sample of 10,000 tweets related to the Air Miles Rewards Program. The results showed that gamification mechanics and procedural rhetoric were present in the Twitter conversations. However, they were used differently to achieve various elements of community based on competing interests by authors. Findings from this study contribute to the academic and professional world of communication, and can inform digital marketing and social media strategies for community engagement
