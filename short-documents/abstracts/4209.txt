Abnormalities in the rhythmic electromechanical contractions of the heart results in cardiac arrhythmias. When these abnormalities rise from the ventricles of the heart, they are classified as ventricular arrhythmias. The two major types of ventricular arrhythmias are ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Ventricular fibrillation is the most dangerous among the two arrhythmias, that usually leads to sudden cardiac death if not treated immediately. Annually about 40,000 sudden cardiac deaths are reported in Canada. Due to high mortality rate and serious impact on quality of life, researchers have been focusing on characterizing ventricular arrhythmias
that may lead to delivering optimized treatment options in improving the survival rates.

In this thesis two major types of ventricular arrhythmias were analyzed and quantified by performing discriminative sparse coding analysis called label consistent K-SVD using time frequency dictionaries that are well localized in time and frequency domains. The analyzed signals were 670 ECG ventricular arrhythmia segments from 33 patients extracted from the Malignant Ventricular Ectopy and Creighton University Tachy-Arrhythmia databases. Using the LCKSVD dictionary learning approach, an overall maximum classification accuracy of 73.3% was achieved with a hybrid optimized wavelet dictionary. Based on the comparative analysis, the trained (learned) dictionaries yielded better performance than the untrained dictionaries. The results indicate that discriminative sparse coding approach has greater potential in extracting signal adaptive and morphologically discriminative time-frequency structures in studying ventricular arrhythmias.
