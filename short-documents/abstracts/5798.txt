The objective was to design a municipal wastewater treatment plant with primary sedimentation and without primary sedimentation and then compare the savings in capital cost. The project discussed the design procures for the various units such as preliminary units, secondary units and tertiary units. The parametric cost estimation concept is utilized to arrive at the capital cost savings. The literature review includes the various methods to recover the nutrients from the wastewater. The literature review also includes various measures to be taken for performance improvement of municipal wastewater treatment plants. This project concludes that capital cost savings of about twenty percent can be achieved by not providing the primary sedimentation.
