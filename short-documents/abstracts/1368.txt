    Great interest has aroused in developing the next generation body armour based on the incorporation of a Shear Thickening Fluid (STF) into high performance fabrics (Kevlar®, UHMWPE). This innovative technoloy allows for the production of comfortable, flexible, lightweight, stab and ballistic resistant protective garments. This innovative technology allows for the production of comfortable, flexible, lightweight, stab and ballistic resistant protective garments. The furrent research was undertaken to evaluate the stab resistance and the chemical properties of types of high performance fabrics, Kevlar and Ultra Hight Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE), impregnated with several types of shear thickening fluids. The stab resistance properties of all samples were tested using drop tower and quasistatic testing apparatuses. Chemical compositions and microscopic structures were analyzed with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. The current study demonstrated the importance of incorporating Shear Thickening Fluid into woven high performance fibres. The results clearly display a significant enhancement in puncture resistance ony of Kevlar® fabrics impregnated with different combination of STFs.
