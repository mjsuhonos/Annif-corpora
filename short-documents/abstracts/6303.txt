The aim of this study was to access the coping of premature infants during ROP eye exams both before and after receiving 3 child life support sessions.  This assessment used the adapted COMFORT behavior scale as a reliable and validated standardized assessment tool.  An experienced ROP clinic nurse and a clinic fellow made paired observations during 2 routine ROP eye exams to record infant coping.  9 infants were consented into the study and 2 infants were found to be at risk for ROP and therefore continued in the study.  The other 7 infants were found to be not at risk.  The results of the pre and post test coping results demonstrated a drop in distress and an increase in each infants coping during the ROP eye exam.  The results suggest that Child Life support sessions do increase and enhance premature infant coping during ROP eye exams.
