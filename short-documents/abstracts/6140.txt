This project explores the factors that come into play in the assessment of a refugee claim put forth by unaccompanied/separated minors when arriving in Canada.  Designed as an exploratory research, the study delves into the procedural and evidentiary issues which emerge when such children cross our borders.  The substantial literature that has emerged over the last decades on the issue serves to inform and guide the process of determining what has been accomplished, as well as what needs to be improved upon.  Informed by the American and European models, the goal of this research is to sketch a seemingly Canadian model which would outline step by step the protocol in place, and would define our governmentâ€™s role and actions in terms of addressing the plight of these children as they cross our border.
