    A two-step partitioning algorithm for FE meshes is proposed in this work for the purposes of time savings. A direct method based on the concept of 'separateness' was applied first, followed by a partition optimization process that used a Genetic Algorithm (GA). A total of 9 applications were evaluated to demonstrate the durability, versatility, and effectiveness of this partitioning algorithm with respect to interface node count and subdomain load balance. Beyond this wingbox optimization problem was performed on a single processor using a GA to demonstrate the possible time savings of the method. With a 30% decrease in compute time witnessed, it can be said with confidence that the propose partitioning algorithm was a success.
