The problem of synthesis of missing image parts represents an interesting and challenging area of image 
processing and computer vision with significant potential. This thesis, focuses on an adaptive
depth-guided image completion method that addresses the image completion problem using information
contained in the rest of the image. The completion process is separated into structure and texture
synthesis. A method is first introduced for completing the respective depth map through the use of a
diffusion-based operation, preserving global image structure within the unknown region. Building upon
the state of the art exemplar based inpainting technique of Barnes et al., we complete the target (unknown) 
region by matching to and blending source patches drawn from the rest of the image, using the
reconstructed depth information to guide the completion process. Secondly, for each target patch, we
formulate an adaptive patch size determination as an optimization problem that minimizes an objective
function involving local image gradient magnitude and orientations. An extension to the coherence-
based objective function introduced by Wexler et al. is then introduced, which not only encourages
coherence of the respective target region with respect to the source region in colour but also in depth.
We further consider the variance between patches in the SSD criteria for preventing error accumulation
and propagation. Experimental results show that our method can provide a significant improvement to
patch-based image completion algorithms shown by PSNR and SSIM calculations as well as a qualitative
subjective study.
