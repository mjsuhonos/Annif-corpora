    Vibration can cause problems when it occurs during machining, especially if it cannot be damped and continuous to increase, a phenomenon known as chatter. This thesis project focuses on reviewing the state-of-the-arts work in chatter research, identifying a reliable mechanistic dynamic cutting force model for orthogonal cutting operations when machining slender shafts, carrying out a series of experiments on uniform and stepped workpiece[s], and validating the theoretical predictions of chatter onset conditions against experimental results.
