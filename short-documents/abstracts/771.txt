    Meta search engines allow multiple engine searches to minimize biased information and improve the quality of the results it generates. However, existing meta engine applications contain many foreign language results, and only run on Windows platform. The meta search engine we develop will resolve these problems. Our search engine will run on both Windows and Linus platforms, and has some desirable properties: 1) users can shorten the search waiting time if one of the search engines is down 2) users can sort the result titles in an alphabetic or relevancy order. Current meta search websites only allow users to sort results by relevancy. Our search engine allows users to do an alphabetical search from the previous relevancy search result, so that the users can identify the required title within a shorter time frame.
