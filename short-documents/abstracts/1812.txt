    This study seeks to inquire into the impacts of pursuing a comprehensive Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) program similar to the system in the European Union in the Province of Ontario. O. Reg. 393/04 WEEE seeks to establish a weight-based system of recycling end-of-life (EOL) electronics. BAT revenue projections would make for a profitable endeavour across the first five years of the program, with reductions in pollution and operating costs from primary ore refinement. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the BAT scheme profitability exceeds the "do nothing" option across all price ranges (including worst case scenarios), while, at the same time, results in increased susceptibility to market volatility. A cost-effectiveness study showed that the investment in a new integrated smelting operation would still be more cost-effective than the "do nothing" option. This study points to the need for further research into market incentives regarding the amount of collected electronic waste.
