Transitional moment conditions exist almost everywhere around us, and are an effective device in defining a place. It is through enhancing these thresholds, and defining a clearer, vivid environment that creates places from spaces, that facilitates variety through visual clarity, hierarchy, and synthesis necessary at the urban and architectural levels. This thesis will argue that creating an engaging and fulfilling environment architecturally and on an urban level, is highly dependent on the successful threshold conditions in various degrees of complexity.
