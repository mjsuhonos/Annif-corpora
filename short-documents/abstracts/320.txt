Externalism holds that the individuation of mental content depends on factors  external  to  the  subject.  This  doctrine appears  to  undermine  both  the  claim  that  there  is  a  priori  self-knowledge,  and  the  view  that  individuals  have  privileged  access to their thoughts. Tyler Burge’s influential inclusion theory of self-knowledge purports  to  reconcile externalism  with  authoritative  self-knowledge.  I  first  consider   Paul  Boghossian’s  claim  that  the  inclusion theory  is  internally  inconsistent.  I  reject  one  line  of  response  to  this  charge,  but  I  endorse  another.  I  next  suggest,  however,  that the inclusion theory has little explanatory value.
