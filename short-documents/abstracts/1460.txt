    This thesis analyzes a collection of 101 photographs by American amateur photographer Jeanette Bernard held at George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film (GEH). Bernard lived in Long Island, New York, and produced photographs from 1904 to 1924 and actively participated in amateur photography competitions in newspapers those years. The first part of the paper analyzes Bernard's work within the broader context of amateur photograph competitions through a detailed examination of Leslie's Weekly, the newspaper she most regularly submitted her work, with an emphasis on the year 1907. The second part of the paper outlines the steps taken to make this material available and searchable within the GEH's database, The Museum System (TMS), and includes an appendix which compares the fully illustrated catalogue.
