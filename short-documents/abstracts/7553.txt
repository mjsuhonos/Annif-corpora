This thesis focuses on the current state of combined sewer overflows (CSO) in the City of Toronto and the potential benefits of utilizing real-time monitoring system to explore options for optimizing current models and reducing future overflows. CSOs containing sanitary and stormwater sewage over spill during wet weather conditions, contaminating bodies of water. Antiquated sewer systems built to support population at the time, no longer have the required capacity to support exponential growth causing environmental damage. 

Key research findings include exploring the current CSO state in the City of Toronto, remediation plans executed by the City in hopes to reduce CSO and finally concluding the Cityâ€™s progress to date. Extensive research on CSOs in North American cities has shown initiative towards reducing CSOs while using real-time monitoring systems which can be utilized in the City of Toronto. Future research is required to find effective and efficient ways of implementing such systems.
