    Smart grid is expected to improve the efficiency, reliability and economics of current energy systems. Using two-way flow of electricity and information, smart grid builds an automated, highly distributed energy delivery network. In this thesis, we present the requirements for intrusion detection systems in smart grid, neighborhood area network (NAN) in particular. We propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) that considers the constraints and requirements of the NAN. It captures the communication and computation overhead constraints as well as the lack of a central point to install the IDS. The IDS is distributed on some nodes which are powerful in terms of memory, computation and the degree of connectivity. Our IDS uses an analytical approach for detecting Wormhole attack. We simulate wireless mesh NANs in OPNET Modeler and for the first time, we integrate our analytical model in Maple from MapleSoft with our OPNET simulation model.
