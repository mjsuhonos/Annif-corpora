A control method for the stand-alone wind power generation system with induction generator and energy storage devices is proposed in this thesis. A fixed-speed self-excited induction generator is directly connected to the standalone power system, while battery powered energy storage devices are employed to balance the system power flow. A DC-AC power converter is connected between the energy storage device and the standalone power system, which maintains the voltage and frequency constant.                                                                                                              Direct voltage control with current limits is developed for the converter with dynamic fast response. Mathematical models are developed to analysis the system performance as well as to design the lead-lag regulators in the control system. The proposed system is verified in the simulation and experiment.
