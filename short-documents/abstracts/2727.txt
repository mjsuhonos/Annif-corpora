Of the available treatments for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE), and pharmacotherapy are the protocols with the strongest research support. To investigate individualsâ€™ preferences for treatment, participants were asked to read descriptions of CPT, PE, and pharmacotherapy, choose which one they think they would prefer should they require treatment, and rate their perceptions of treatment credibility. Two simultaneous studies were conducted: one with undergraduate and the other with online participants, and the latter had higher scores on measures of symptom distress. CPT was the first choice in both studies and was considered the most credible option. Undergraduate participants preferred PE as their second choice, while online participants picked pharmacotherapy. Undergraduate participants found PE to be more credible than pharmacotherapy, while online participants found them to be equally credible. Both groups chose psychotherapy alone as their first choice when given the option to combine psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.
