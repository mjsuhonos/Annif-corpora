Despite the renewed interest in ephemera, there is limited research available on film ephemera. A survey of current literature shows there is a clear lack of work being done to study and preserve this material in public institutions. This thesis looked at the management and care of ephemera collections, specifically poster collections. The Toronto International Film Festivalâ€™s Film Reference Library (FRL) has developed a large reference collection as well as numerous special collections from various directors, artists, and donors. The Guy McKone Collection has over 900 posters in various formats. The goal of this project included: organizing, cataloguing, describing, and partial digitization of the material. By creating a comprehensive catalogue, I have identified and discussed issues that arise while processing a poster collection. Policies, procedures, storage space, and management systems affect how these collections are ultimately handled. My goal is to start a conversation on the importance of film ephemera and to show how vital ephemera is for collections and historical narratives. I also identify issues that arise when managing collections of this type, and provide initial suggestions for the management and preservation of poster collections.
