This exploratory, qualitative study was focused on answering three research questions: 1)
Would Airbnb homeowner hosts be willing to participate in an environmental certification
program? 2) What would motivate Airbnb homeowner hosts to participate in an environmental
certification program? 3) What program design elements would enhance the likelihood of their
participation in the program? The study used semi-structured face-to-face and telephone
interviews to collect data from Airbnb hosts. Only hosts in the Greater Toronto Area whose
property was a freehold, detached or semi-detached house were eligible for participation. Results
indicated a willingness to participate in an environmental certification program, with two unique
motivations revealed, specifically the ability to attract like-minded guests and measure household
impacts. A number of program design elements were also reviewed, with hostsâ€™ concerns
focusing on cost and guest comfort. Hosts also expressed a preference for a program that
leveraged the existing Airbnb review system.
