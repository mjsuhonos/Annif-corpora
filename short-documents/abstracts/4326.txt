In this thesis, we develop a Generic Profiler which is a solution to profiling for mobile computation cloud offloading. Profiling refers to the process of examining and collecting statistics and information about data. The Generic Profiler uses resection in many cases to reduce redundant code and allow developers to easily incorporate new profilers to
their offloading solutions. Third party developers can include the Generic Profiler into their solutions with ease and without having to worry about the underlying processes of storing data using a Content Provider. The Generic Profiler also contains a set of default profilers, which include a Location Profiler, Software Profiler, Wi-Fi Profiler, Telephony
Profiler, and a Battery Profiler. Using the Software Profiler, we have shown that the performance, in terms of inclusive invocation time, of the profilers which are designed by implementing the Generic Profiler adequately store data.
