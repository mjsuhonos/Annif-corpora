Background: Patientsâ€™ learning needs are influenced by socio-cultural characteristics such as level of formal education, sex, and age. Limited research has examined this influence. Purpose: The purpose of this study was twofold: 1) to describe the number and type of learning needs identified, and 2) to examine the relationships between learning needs and socio-cultural characteristics (education, sex, and age). Design: This study was a sub-study of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) that evaluated the most appropriate time for delivering education to patients who had CABG surgery. Sample: Individuals having CABG with 1-4 grafts for the first time and who were literate and cognitively oriented to person, place, and time were included in this study. Analysis: Descriptive and correlation statistics were used to analyze the data. Results: A significant difference between learning needs and sex (p = 0.00) was noted, while a significant relationship between learning needs and age (p = 0.03) was identified. Conclusion: This study represents a first step towards identifying the association between perceived learning needs and socio-cultural characteristics.
