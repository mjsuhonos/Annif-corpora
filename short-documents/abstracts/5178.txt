This paper analyzes the interrelationship between European Union (EU) enlargement and the issue of citizenship and border management with respect to Poland and Romania. It examines the changes of the EU's external and internal borders through an analysis of immigration laws in Poland and Romania which have been recently changed in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen aquis. This paper argues that the transformation of European borders through eastern enlargement creates a system of differentiated memberships which is incompatible with the concept of the EU citizenship and with some of the terms of enlargement. Unfortunately, this situation is opening the door for the creation of 'second class' citizens and demonstrates that the EU enlargement process is to some extent exclusive.
