This research focuses on the environmental impacts related to the manufacturing of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. The life cycle assessment (LCA) method was used to assess the environmental impacts for a CS6XVP module. The current supply chain, based in China, was compared  to a hypothetical Ontario based supply chain to determine environmental and economic costs.  LCA results showed that the manufacturing of modules in Ontario reduced primary energy demands by 22% and GHG emission by 88%.  Moreover, the carbon difference between supply chains equated to $5.84 per module. This leads to the conclusion that there are clear environmental benefits to manufacturing PV technology in Ontario; however, the economic benefits of carbon costing are not significant enough to encourage a complete shift in the current supply chain. It is suggested that a change in carbon policy could help to support the development of PV manufacturing and other renewable energy technologies in Ontario.
