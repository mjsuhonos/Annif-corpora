Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) have garnered considerable attention given their desirable design properties including, transparency and flexibility. A considerable amount of research has been done in all facets of the DSSC permitting significant progress in device development. However, there is still much improvement needed to make DSSCs a viable alternative energy option. The I-/ I3 - electrolyte has been used extensively in DSSCs but has inherent drawbacks including its absorption range and corrosiveness to DSSC components. Recently, cobalt based electrolytes and hole transport materials (HTMs) have shown promise of improved performance, especially in combination with metal free dyes. This thesis aims to develop a mastery of device fabrication and then study and compare various electrolytes paired with triphenylamine (TPA) and BODIPY based dyes with the aim of improving DSSC efficiency and long-term stability.
