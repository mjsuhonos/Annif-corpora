    The goal of this paper is to uncover the underlying factors that have lead [i.e. led] to the different federal-provincial immigration agreements. This is the crux of my research question: What accounts for the differences between the federal-provincial agreements on immigration? From my research it has become very clear that historical institutionalism or institutional relations, as well as institutional capacity, politics and political relations and to an extent the economic differences between the provinces are all factors that account for the variations in the bi-lateral agreements between the government of Canada and the different provinces. These factors help to explain why Qu√©bec has been able to negotiate the most complete policy and why the other provinces, with particular emphasis on Manitoba and Ontario, have not been able to negotiate similar bi-lateral agreements.
