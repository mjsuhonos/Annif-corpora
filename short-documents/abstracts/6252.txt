This study looks at the agency and activism of Filipina live-in caregivers in Toronto and how they break the isolation seemingly imposed by the live-in caregiver Program and foster their own settlement in Toronto. This research details the problem approach, which puts forward neoliberalism as a great hindrance to the settlement of these women, and contrasts it with the agency approach, which stipulates that agency, resiliency, resistance, and social capital are also important forces in shaping their experiences in Toronto. Four in-depth interviews were conducted and the main themes that transpired were religion, family, the desire for normalcy, and developing community networks mainly, but not necessarily exclusively, within the Filipino community. Policy implications include encouraging grass-roots associations to promote informal socializing during evenings or week-ends, when caregivers have time to participate in activities outside of their work.
