    This thesis examines the expeditionary photographs taken in association with the S.M.S. Bismarck and commercial photographs by the Dufty Brothers in the nineteenth century South Pacific. It is not a study of the culture and lives of South Pacific peoples, but rather of the nineteenth century European society, culture, and imperial benevolence that led to their production and collection into this album. The photography that is included in this study reflects the prevailing culture of capitalism and colonialism of the nineteenth century and demonstrates influences from anthropological science, art, studio and commercial photography. By placing these images within the context of photographic history, South Pacific history, and European colonialism of the late nineteenth century, they can be assessed against the notion that photographs occupy a temporal space that is fractured by its very nature and mode of production, but also by its representation of events, people and landscapes.
