    This paper presents a combination of methods for spatial multi-criteria evaluation with principles of geographic visualization. Decision-makers are enabled to test multi-criteria decision strategies through the interactive manipulation of map symbols, linked displays, and transient selection and highlighting of data points. The results of different scenarios can then be compared and calibrated with the userâ€™s knowledge. The paper introduces two case studies for geographic visualization in spatial decision support for public health planning and urban quality of life assessment. The case studies illustrate how map-centred interactive exploration of criteria hierarchies and importance weights affords a deeper insight into decision problems than traditional methods.
