This paper examines the park planning and design process in ethnic minority neighbourhoods, such as Toronto's 13 Priority Areas. Through the selection of two case study Priority Areas (Jane-Finch and Malvern), an extensive literature review, interviews and youth focus groups, issues in park planning in the Toronto context are identified. Qualitative data collection highlights concerns regarding standardized parks that do not meet the needs of their diverse clientele, inadequate facilities and lack of public participation in park planning. Recommendations for park planning for ethnic minority neighbourhoods include approaching park planning as a process rather than a service, conducting park user surveys, improving access to information, and community mobilization, among others.
