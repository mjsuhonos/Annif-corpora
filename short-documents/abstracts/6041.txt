Given the assertion that planners exist within a restrictive environment that inhibits their ability to maximize creativity within their profession, this paper investigates what these restrictions are, and how municipal planners deal with them to maximize creativity.  To do this, the opinions and experiences of ten currently practicing planners from municipalities within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) are presented.  Findings suggest that barriers to creativity can be attributed to four main categories:  provincial legislation; corporate standards and regulations; internal culture/leadership: and resource limitations.  They also indicate that individual creativity often occurs on a small scale, in a manner that allows for the gradual and incremental overcoming of restrictions.
