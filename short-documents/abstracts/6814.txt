This paper will analyse and consider 360-足degree videos in the context of previous new technologies and how they changed processes for journalism.  Referencing previous research literature, news articles, case studies and my
personal experience using 360-足degree videos as a videojournalist, this paper will serve as a conceptual review in order to better understand new considerations that might have to be taken when considering 360-足degree videos for daily news production. Moreover, this paper will review the introduction of liveblogs and Facebook Live, and how each has fundamentally changed journalism. By doing so, this conceptual review will hope to identify unique challenges and successes that 360-足degree video journalism might have for the reporter from a technical,
ethical and storytelling point of view.
