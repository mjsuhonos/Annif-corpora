Single reel abridgements of commercial feature films are entering moving image archives
because home movie collections that contain them are slowly increasing in archival
representation. The abridged commercial films occupy a liminal space in between sustained
preservation efforts that focus on studio films and the current interest paid to preserving home
movies. As a result, the abridged films are being neglected. The filmsâ€™ liminal status stems from
a dearth of information regarding their relationship to the original films and a clear definition of
what they are narratively and aesthetically. After analyzing fourteen abridged horror and science
fiction films found in the Ryerson Moving Image collection and comparing them to their original
counterparts this project finds that the abridged films are heavily altered in terms of narrative,
characters, and causality, and should be treated as individual objects instead of derivative
works, thus absolving their liminal status.
