The Canadian North has gained significant interest as of late due to expansive availability of natural resources, and the opening up of commercial shipping routes, resulting in economic and development potential.  There is thus a demand to develop and build, but this has often occurred with little vision while the extreme conditions of this region make viable inhabitation a challenge.  
Presently, the Inuit who have maintained a sustainable way of life in the Canadian North have seen their lifestyle and culture erode due to rapid modernization, resulting in numerous challenges and no resolutions.  One such challenge is the absence of affordable, adequate, and cultural appropriate housing, complicated by a housing shortage and a growing population. In order to ensure successful inhabitation in this region, a reinterpretation of the contemporary Inuit home is required.  The following thesis project |explores how the adoption of a regionally responsive architecture responds not only to economic and environmental conditions, but reinforces the unique cultural identity of the Inuit.
