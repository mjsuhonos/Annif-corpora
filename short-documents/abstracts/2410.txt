    Making up a disproportionate amount of the homeless youth population, LGBTQ homeless youth face a myriad of problems from increased depression and anxiety, emotional and belonging issues; higher rates of suicide, drug and alcohol abuse; and higher rates of STI and heath problems associated with increased rates of survival sex.
    The findings, derived from a literature review, a review of current policies and land use planning tools in Toronto, interviews with two frontline homeless service providers and two policy workers, have brought to light areas where the profession of urban planning can contribute to reform the current system of shelter and support facilities.
    Through language and skills training, provincial and municipal policy on housing and homelessness, land use planning tools of zoning by-­‐laws and public consultations and the siting of facilities, and political backing, urban planning can help to aid in the provision of services for LGBTQ homeless youth.
