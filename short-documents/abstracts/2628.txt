Soot emissions from combustion devices are known to have adverse effects on the environment and human health. Thus, the development of techniques to reduce soot formation and emissions remains an important goal of researchers and industry. This study leverages existing knowledge in soot modelling and soot formation fundamentals to develop a stand-alone, computationally inexpensive soot concentration estimator, to be linked to CFD simulations as a post-processor. The estimator was developed using fluid parcel tracking techniques that can track entire history to which a particle or fluid parcel has been exposed. Preliminary results suggest that the estimator is capable of predicting peak and emitted soot volume fractions in atmospheric pressure flames.
