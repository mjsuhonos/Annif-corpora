    As highly dense urban areas are also the top energy consumers per capita, the question as to how we can design our cities to be "solar ready", i.e. suitable for successful integration of active and passive solar strategies in buildings, arises. Through a series of insolation simulations of typical urban morphologies found in the city of Toronto, this study will (i) identify if Toronto is "solar ready", (ii) suggest strategies to overcome obstacles, and (iii) propose new building formations that maximize insolation levels to promote the integration of solar strategies in our built environments.
