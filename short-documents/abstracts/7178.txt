This thesis examined the characteristics of persons found NCRMD for sexual offences, their offences, and the degree to which empirically supported risk factors predicted Review Board decisions. Reasons documents dated from 2006 to 2015, and examining index sexual offences were collected from LawSource Â©. Search terms were derived from the Canadian Criminal Code (1985, c. C-46), and commonly accepted terminology for sexual offending. Findings suggest that persons found NCRMD for sexual offences present with general and sexual offence specific risk factors for recidivism. However, Review Board decisions were only predicted by factors related to clinical functioning and risk management factors. These findings suggest that further research is needed to examine risk assessment, decision making, and forensic mental health outcomes of persons found NCRMD for sexual offences. Implications for treatment of persons found NCRMD and knowledge dissemination to Review Boards are also discussed.
