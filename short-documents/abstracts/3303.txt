This research paper discusses the growing trend of interactive displays in art institutions as a relevant shift in the discourse on photographic literacy, and it is addressed towards curators, archivists, museum professionals, and new media artists with a specialization in photographic studies. The paper explores the concerns of digitized materiality in interactive exhibitions, virtual museums, and image databases. Four case studies will be utilized in this discussion, including the Peel Art Gallery Museum and Archives, Google Cultural Institute, Flickr: The Commons, and The Lowcounty Digital History Initiative. The relationship between digitized materials and visitors requires an ongoing review of how a diverse demographic of museumgoers read photographs and relate to them in exhibitions. This research paper utilizes topics from new media studies to better understand the implications, benefits, and drawbacks of these different types of displays, and how they fit into the narrative of photographic theory and exhibition design.
