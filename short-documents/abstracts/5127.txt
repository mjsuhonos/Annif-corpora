Ultrasound imaging based on transmitting plane waves (PW) enables ultrafast imaging. Coherent PW compounding ultrasound imaging can reach the image quality of optimal multifocus image. In the image reconstruction, it was assumed that an infinite extent PWs was emitted. In this thesis, we propose a new image reconstruction algorithm – Synthetic-aperture plane-wave (SAPW) imaging – without using this assumption. The SAPW imaging was compared with the PWs imaging in numerical simulations and experimental measurements. The measured RF data in PW imaging was first decoded in the frequency domain using a pseudoinverse algorithm to estimate the RF data Then, SAPW RF data were used to reconstruct images through the standard synthetic transit aperture (STA) method. Main improvements in the image quality of the SAPW imaging in comparison with the PWs imaging are increases in the depth of penetration and the field of view when contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was used as a quantitative metric.
