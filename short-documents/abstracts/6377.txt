This project paper addresses the major problem of scrap tire management in Ontario. It examines the environmental and health impacts associated with current disposal practices. To address the absence of a management program and lack of regulation for tire disposal in Ontario, tire management programs implemented in other provinces in Canada are evaluated and compared with Ontario, in order to explore the causes of its failure to develop and implement a comprehensive scrap tire management program. The divergence from Ontario on adopting a similar kind of tire managenet program is because of its strong market driven tire industry and governent's reluctance to implement another tax. This paper encourages a tire management system for Ontario as well, which is very similar to those already implemented in other provinces throughout Canada.
