This major research paper probed the recent controversy about the decision by The National Energy Board (NEB) to approve the Enbridge LINE 9 project. It examined the decision-­making process using the in-­depth-­case-­study analysis method. The research questioned the grounds this decision of the NEB was based on, whether this decision-­making was science-‐based, and if its Environmental Assessment component adequately addressed the risk to the environment and affected communities. The investigation was based on the evidence that has been documented in the hundreds of hearing transcripts, filings, written evidence, regulations, reports, and other source of information such as intervenors’ websites and newspapers. Using a conflict-centered, retrospective narrative approach, the paper revealed the true nature of this decision-­making process. Its flaws and defects were identified and deeper examinations of the relationships among the principal actors were revealed.
