    Peer-to-peer or P2P file-sharing application on wireless ad hoc mobile network (MANET) has gained a lot of interest in the recent years. A peer-to-peer network is an overlay network that is deployed over ad hoc networks. Our work is analyzing two P2P systems over MANET. The systems evaluated are representing two distinct categories in terms of network topology such as unstructured and structured architectures. RAON or Resource-Aware Overlay Network, which is an improvement of an existent P2P system called Gia, is an unstructured system. CAN or Content-Addressable Network is an existent P2P system in the category of structured architectures. Based on the simulations of the two P2P systems over MANET, we evaluated the performance in terms of query search success rate and query search delay.
