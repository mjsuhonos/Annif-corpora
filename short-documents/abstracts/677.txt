    This paper investigates the experiences of eight Eritrean youth between the ages of 19-28 living in Toronto, with the purpose of contributing to existing literature on factors affecting the successful integration of second generation racialized youth. Literature on the integration and overall success of second generation racialized youth is growing in Canada, but addressing the experiences of Eritrean youth has garnered no scholarly interest. This is largely a result of little to no information on who the Eritrean community is, how it is integrating in Canadian society, and what kinds of settlement patterns it has followed in Canada. This study opens avenues of research opportunity on this community and seeks to explore, albeit in a limited fashion how the parents’ experiences with settlement and integration affects their children, if at all. My research suggests that the parents’ experiences with social exclusion, in the form of socio-economic disadvantage have in fact important implications for their Canadian children.
