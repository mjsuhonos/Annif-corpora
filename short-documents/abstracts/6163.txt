This study explored through naturalistic inquiry three early childhood teacher's perceptions of inclusion and in-class practices in the inclusive preschool classroom. Interviews and in-class observations were used for the purpose of data collection. A social constructivist lens was used to analyze the data. Drawing from a social model of inclusion and theory of attribution framework, the results revealed that inclusion is multifaceted. An understanding and commitment to the ideology of inclusion must occur in conjunction with inclusive in-class strategies and techniques to create successful inclusive programs. This study suggests recommendations for change must be made at the government level, the post-secondary education level and at the community level. These reforms need to be made collaboratively to ensure that all stakeholders have a common understanding and vision for inclusion.
