Manual quantum programming is generally diffcult for humans, due to the often hard-to-grasp properties of quantum mechanics and quantum computers. By outlining the target (or desired) behaviour of a particular quantum program, the task of programming can be turned into a search and optimization problem. A flexible evolutionary technique known as genetic programming may then be used as an aid in the search for quantum programs. In this work a genetic programming approach uses an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to learn the probability distribution of optimal solution(s), given some target behaviour of a quantum program.
