Gold nanoparticles (GNP) have been shown to highly absorb ionizing radiation compared to tissue. GNPs have also been shown to be high absorbers of non-ionizing radiation with a peak absorbance at a wavelength dependent on their shape and size. This study investigated radiation dose enhancement in PC3 cells when in the presence of gold nanorods (NR) and near infrared light (IR). The PC3 cells were incubated with either PEGylated NRs (PNR) or anti prostate stem cell antigen antibody with nuclear localization sequence peptide conjugated NRs (AbNR). They were exposed to near infrared light at a wavelength of 810 nm to achieve a temperature of 42 ºC to 43 ºC for 60 minutes. They were also exposed to 160 kVp x-rays. It was found that both targeted and non-targeted GNPs when exposed to radiation and near infrared light synergistically enhanced radiation dose. It was also found that AbNRs provide greater dose enhancement than PNRs.
