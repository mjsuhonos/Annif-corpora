The intention of this research is to examine the viability in activating Toronto’s neglected laneways. Behind the densely populated streets of Toronto’s downtown core, lie arguably one of its most underutilized assets: its laneways. Dimly lit, and typically filled with rubbish, these are spaces with potential. This research focuses on Toronto’s possibilities in the creation of laneways as a legitimate urban space; forgotten spaces with the potential to stimulate growth and create lively, safe communities. The literature will examine current policies that may hinder the widespread use of, or lead to the neglect of these spaces, as well as draw conclusions about possible policy and cultural shifts with the potential to revive and create an adaptive laneway culture.
