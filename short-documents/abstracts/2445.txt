    Human-computer interaction systems have been providing new ways for amateurs to compose music using traditional computer peripherals as well as gesture interfaces. Vibro-tactile patterns, which are a vibrational art form similar to auditory music, can also be composed using human-computer interfaces. This thesis discusses the gesture interface system called the Vibro-Motion, which facilitates the composition of vibro-tactile patterns in real-time on an existing tactile sensory substitution system called the Emoti-Chair. The Vibro-Motion allows users to control the pitch, magnitude of the vibration as well as the position of the vibration. A usability evaluation of Vibro-Motion system showed it to be intuitive, comfortable and enjoyable for the participants.
