This study examines the impact of current social, political and economic changes on women’s voluntary organizations. Thirty eight leaders of women’s voluntary organizations from across Canada were interviewed. Our findings show that although there is a sense of increased competition for scarce dollars, the favoured solutions do not focus on competitive strategies. Rather, collaboration is held up as the ideal.
