In this major research project, I explore the ways in which animation can be developed to improve art education. I developed an animated short film titled The Art Collector as an educational tool that incorporates computer animation technology with art theory, to educate about art theory and art history in a unique way through paintings from three different surrealist artists: Salvador Dali, Rene Magritte and Max Ernst. I also provide some background information as to how this animation project came to be, including the development of the script, the main character, and the animation itself. I draw upon several studies that illustrate the ways in which animation can be used successfully as an education tool to motivate student learning.
