There are many complex issues that pertain to the physical housings used to contain a photograph collection. Information on this topic is varied and hard to obtain, yet there is a growing need for this information to be widely available, especially for workers in the archival, photographic, museum and cultural heritage community. The goal of this Professional Practice Project was to create an applied guide illustrating the care of photographic collections that could be used as a resource by professionals in the field. Design and Materials: Suggestions for Photographic Housing presents my research and analysis of this area of the field as well as an illustrated guide that is intended to be used as a future resource by professional collection managers responsible for large scale photographic collections.
