In recent years the Run-Time-Reconfigurable (RTR) computing systems have become the core of next generation of adaptive embedded systems. One of the major problems in this class of systems is run-time adaptation of their architecture to the dynamic workload and environmental conditions. In most cases this adaptation is considered as multi-objective optimization process which should be conducted in run-time.
Therefore, the goal of this research work was to explore the existing methods of doing multi-objective optimization and analyze their applicability for a system with potential of reconfiguration (i.e. a situation when constrains of the system can change during the course of operation). Then the development of generic framework of this optimization mechanism has to be done. This required analysis and selection of proper approach for multi-objective space exploration. The methodology based on Architecture Configuration Graph was chosen and its searching technique improved to allow faster convergence to a solution that satisfies objective constraints while optimizing specified objective. The run-time complexity analysis was done for modified methodology as well as the testing of the implemented framework to demonstrate its faster performance. The experimental results have shown the ability for run-time architecture adaptation and further utilization of the proposed framework as a core of real-time operating systems (RTOS) for dynamically reconfigurable computers.
