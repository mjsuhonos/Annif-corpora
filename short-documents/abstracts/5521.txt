The development of British menswear during the first phase of the Peacock Revolution from 1960 to 1965 demonstrated a significant visual change in the representation of masculinity. Examining the elements that helped shape this moment in style indicates a deep rooted relationship between a group of upper class dandies and rock music icons. This practice-based study addresses gaps in existing research, qualitatively exploring the  collaborative role of fashion and music that supported the progression of menswear. The methodological framework investigates the process of sociocultural evolution through the study of memetics, accompanied by a semiotic analysis of oppositional dress. Bricolage was applied as a method of shaping and applying new meaning to the themes investigated in this 
research, expressing the potential of music to serve as a vehicle for change. An interactive audio-visual installation piece has been created to stimulate audience participation, encouraging the public to question more generally how fashion and music collaborate to facilitate shifts in identity.
