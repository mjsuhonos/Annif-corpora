Perforations is a personal, experimental film that explores the residue and layers of memory through the emotional landscape of the artist’s entrance into middle age. The project navigates the ephemeral nature of memory, loss, absence, frailty, complexity and — ultimately — renewal in life through the interconnections and legacies of three generations. The thesis examines the way in which specific absences in history (women, class and collective memory) and the recounting of family history (through home movies, reconstruction of personal memory and the cycles of life, death and the landscape) contribute to the underlying basis of the film.
