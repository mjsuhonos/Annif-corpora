We report a single step technique of synthesizing particle-agglomerated, amorphous 3-D nanostructures of Al and
Si oxides on powder-fused aluminosilicate ceramic plates and a simple novel method of wafer-foil ablation to
fabricate crystalline nanostructures of Al and Si oxides at ambient conditions. We also propose a particle size
prediction mechanism to regulate the size of vapor-condensed agglomerated nanoparticles in these structures. Size
characterization studies performed on the agglomerated nanoparticles of fabricated 3-D structures showed that the
size distributions vary with the fluence-to-threshold ratio. The variation in laser parameters leads to varying plume
temperature, pressure, amount of supersaturation, nucleation rate, and the growth rate of particles in the plume.
The novel wafer-foil ablation technique could promote the possibilities of fabricating oxide nanostructures with
varying Al/Si ratio, and the crystallinity of these structures enhances possible applications. The fabricated
nanostructures of Al and Si oxides could have great potentials to be used in the fabrication of low
power-consuming complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits and in Mn catalysts to enhance the
efficiency of oxidation on ethylbenzene to acetophenone in the super-critical carbon dioxide.
