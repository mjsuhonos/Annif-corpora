The 2005 Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) has legislated museums to amend tangible and intangible barriers within their curatorial practices by 2025. In this study, a MÃ©tis researcher-practitioner explored artistic ways that museums might curate direct and accessible experiences with artefacts through wearable technology. Utilizing a practice-led creative process, non-traditional aboriginal regalia was developed and displayed in a multimedia installation. The artifact was inspired by the Ojibwe Jingle Dress and dance, which empower and heal through sound. To augment the exhibition experience, a wearable audio system enhances sound from the Jingle Dress and touchless elements, such as electromagnetically induced sound, created an environment where visitor interaction would not compromise artefact preservation. A sound experience was only accessible if a visitor learned how to respectfully interact with the artefact. Both artefact and installation serve as recommendations for museums to effectuate inclusive exhibition experiences and address AODA requirements.
