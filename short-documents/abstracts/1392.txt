    The aerodynamic generated noise in the supersonic wind tunnel during operation at Ryerson University has exceeded the threshold of hearing damage. An acoustic silencer was to be designed and added to the wind tunnel to reduce the noise level.
    The main sources of noise generated from the wind tunnel with the silencer were identified to be located at the convergent divergent nozzle and the turbulent region downstream of the shock wave at the diffuser with the maximum acoustic power level of the entire wind tunnel at 161.09 dB. The designed silencer provided an overall sound pressure level reduction of 21.41 db which was considered as acceptable.
    Refinement to the mesh size and changes to the geometry of the mixing chamber was suggested for a more accurate result in noise output as well as flow conditions would match up to the physical flow. Additional acoustic treatment should be applied to the wind tunnel to further reduce sound pressure level since the noise level still exceeded the threshold of hearing loss.
