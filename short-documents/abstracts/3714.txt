This research investigation is to employ a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) strategy for the Rebecca Street Bridge to provide accurate information regarding the structural behavior and performance of the bridge during regular operation. The research investigation included visual inspection and structural assessment using the MIRA 3D shear wave tomographer to evaluate the bridge structural condition. The overall structural condition of the bridge is good and no major deterioration was noted. However, the voids detected during the shear wave scans could form void clusters in the future, leading to potential cracking and delamination.
     A monitoring strategy was developed based on the crack width and moment curvature of the concrete cross section using reliability analytical models that would allow for lifetime monitoring. The prediction models used the Bridge Condition Index (BCI) to evaluate the structural condition of the bridge. The future works for the Rebecca
Street Bridge includes periodic monitoring as recommended.
