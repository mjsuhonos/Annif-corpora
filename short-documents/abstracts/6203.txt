In addition to the cost savings, technology such as e-learning, hybrid learning and simulations are
tools that are used to equip police force with the competencies and skills needed to protect the public
and respond to the changing demographics. That is, the future of police training will be geared
towards developing competencies to support existing training for police and the recruitment process that relies on technology and integrated crisis management systems. Simulations, robotics and reallife situations are vital in preparing the first responders and decision makers with the skills and competencies needed to respond effectively to a crisis. The successful design of the training strategies will provide police force with tactics that will enable them to offer the training in a suitable delivery medium.

In this paper, we explore the use of simulations and virtual environments in police training, investigate examples of integrated simulation architectures and list how the various learning theories apply to police training. While there has been many research done around the use of simulations and virtual training in police force training, only very few provide information about the use of integrated simulation architecture and the application of learning theories in their training. Thus, comes the novelty of this paper.
