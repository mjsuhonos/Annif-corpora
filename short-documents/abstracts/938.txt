    Women's sexual behavour across sexual orientations was evaluated in this thesis. Evolutionary theory has shown that women and men pursue different reproductive strategies and predicts that strategic interference results when women and men are trying to acquire mates. This study compared women who varied in sexual orientation to assess differences between lesbian, bisexual and heterosexual female scores in sociosexuality. Masculine and feminine personality traits were additionally assessed by the Bem Sex Role Inventory. Sexual fluidity was assessed via interviews. Results indicated that lesbians and heterosexual women had similar scores in sociosexuality, suggesting little effect of strategic interference on lesbian sociosexuality. Extreme Kinsey scale scores were compared (i.e. completely heterosexual and completely lesbian), lesbians reported being more restricted in sociosexuality than heterosexual women. Bisexual women were statistically significantly more unrestricted compared to lesbian and heterosexual women. Lesbians had the highest self ratings of femininity when compared to heterosexual and bisexual women.
