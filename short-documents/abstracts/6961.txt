Public open space is defined by the relationship formed by external surfaces. Through the impact of building fa√ßades on the atmosphere the enveloping membranes evoke people's reactions. In ancient times, crafted materials and spatial sequences enhanced the daily routines of individuals, through their interaction with surfaces that engaged all of their senses. Mass production in the contemporary world, however, alienated traditional techniques of spatial composition and human interaction. Rather than ignoring the decay in the public experience, this thesis aims at strengthening it, with architecture that activates and triggers our consciousness. This thesis takes an approach that examines typical human encounters within contemporary public realm and seeks to disrupt them with compositional strategies of positioning architectural surfaces. Implementation of these strategies enhances the neglected senses and awakens self-awareness. By entering the emotional realm of architecture, this investigation considers the psychological context and complexity of a contemporary pedestrian. Thus, it questions how the pedestrian feels, moves, and responds while being engaged in a perceptual space defined by composition of architectural surfaces.
