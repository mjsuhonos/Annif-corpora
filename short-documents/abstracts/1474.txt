    Induction motors have been widely used in the industries due to their simple and rugged construction.  Failures of this electrical machinery may cause considerable losses.  Therefore adapting an efficient method to diagnose a fault at a very early stage would prevent any further consequences of this deficiency.  The major concern is related to the mechanical failures, normally caused by the inner component deficiencies.  Application of intelligent methods have attracted interest in recent years.  Support Vector Machine is a supervised learning method, based on statistical learning theory.  This thesis presents three different SVM algorithms: SVM, KPCA-SVM and ROC-SVM, applicable for broken rotor bars detection.  SVM proved to be reliable method for classification.  While application of KPCA-SVM, shows nonlinear feature extraction can improve the performance of classifier with respect to reduce the number of overlapping samples. Furthermore, ROC-SVM has improved the accuracy by selecting a decision threshold for the classifier.
