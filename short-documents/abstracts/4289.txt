This paper presents insights into the lived experiences of immigrant women of varying degrees of immigration status, who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) and, as a result, have faced difficulty securing safe and affordable housing. The information was collected through 15 interviews with immigrant women as well as key informants who work with immigrant women. The study findings show that the needs are even more pronounced for immigrant women who face additional barriers such as lack of English/ French language skills, support systems, and financial means. Using an intersectionality perspective, this paper explores the ways in which a lack of adequate housing influences the safety and stability of immigrant women who have experienced IPV in Metro Vancouver.
