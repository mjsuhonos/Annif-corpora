Forming. Shifting. Shaping. The envelope of one’s physiological body extends outwards in multiple shells, layer by layer. The versions of this envelope exist in the interstitial moment between clothing and architecture; ever forming and being
formed, they shift and shape the circulation and happenings of the body on one side and the world on the other. The study of garments lends architecture recognition of various visible and invisible forces that create space and envelope. When space becomes dress, body specificity and movement is emphasized, and the geometries of the physiological body and what it means to experience space as an individual becomes primary, achieving a qualitative, sensory experience extending from the powers of kinaesthetic sense. Oscillating between scales and acts of making, model experimentation invents new ways to conceive and create architecture — a soft architecture finds itself operating here: on the liminal edge of body, envelope, and space
