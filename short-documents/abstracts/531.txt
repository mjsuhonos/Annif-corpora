    This thesis focuses on the life and work of John Beasly Greene, photographer, archaeologist and Egyptologist. I describe Greene's early life, his training in photography with Gustave Le Gray in 1852, his two trips to Egypt in 1853 - 1854 and 1855, his trip to Algeria in 1855 - 1856 and his death in November 1856. I also consider the process and printing of his Egyptian negatives, their number and current location, and whether his book "Le Nil. Monuments - Paysages, Explorations Photographiques Par J.B. Green" (sic) was ever published. In my research I discovered that four separate images of Algeria in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York constitute two panoramas.
