    This qualitative and exploratory research project focuses on the Designated Country of Origin policy in the upcoming legislation, Bill C-31: the Protecting Canadaâ€™s Immigration System Act and its relationship to Legal Aid Ontario. Through interviews with refugee lawyers and refugee settlement workers as well as analysis of policy and Legal Aid documents, research findings provide insight into the effect the Designated Country of Origin list will potentially have on access to Legal Aid Ontario services for refugee claimants from designated countries. Research recommendations point to the importance of reconsidering the manner in which Legal Aid funding is disbursed, as well as policy implications including adjusting the timelines outlined in the upcoming legislation, implementing more stringent designation policies and access to appeal processes.
