Two- thirds of the world’s population will be living in urbanized areas by 2050. The response to this trend in housing demand has been intensification of the urban core, or sprawl. However, this solution addresses only current conditions and does not allow for future change.
People’s housing needs are greatly influenced by their stages of life and by socio-economic factors that are constantly changing over time. However, most housing offers unchanging physical environments. Therefore, there is a conflict the between dynamic nature of people’s lifestyle and their dwellings.
Living in a fast-paced society where change is inevitable, how can we design future housing that responds to the evolving needs and desires of diverse households throughout their life cycle? This thesis argues that homes should not be designed with a single purpose. Instead, they must be flexible and open-ended, and lend themselves conveniently to transform.
