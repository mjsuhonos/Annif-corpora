    This study proposes a bone plate fixation method to reduce the stress shielding effect on the fractured periprosthetic femur fixed with a metallic bone plate. The goal of this study is to design the finite element models of 5 bone plate attachment configurations applied to the periprosthetic femur fractured at 2 different levels (one with simple transverse fracture at mid-shaft with 1mm gap, and the other with 5mm gap at the fracture site simulating bone loss), and to validate the results by comparing with the experimental study. The average stiffness of the intact femur construct was 2502 N/mm which decreased to 1803 N/mm and 801 N/mm for a 1mm and 5mm gap construct, respectively. The finite element model predicted the stiffness results of the experiments within 10% for the 1mm gap fracture case. The finite element model was less reliable when used to predict the stiffness values in the 5mm gap fracture case. The construct fixed only with cables in the proximal femur resulted in the least amount of stress shielding while maintaining a similar level of stiffness compared to the other configurations.
