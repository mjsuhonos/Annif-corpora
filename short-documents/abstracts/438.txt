    This paper discusses the immigrant Irish in Ontario during the Victorian era. Through analytic lenses of xenophobia and social inclusion the historic period is analyzed in the context of immigration and settlement. The two major groups discussed are the Protestant Orangemen and the Irish Catholics. The ruling Protestant class had a great deal of influence over the settlement of the Irish Catholics as this paper discusses. The exclusion and inequity of the Irish Catholics within Ontario is the crux of this paper.
