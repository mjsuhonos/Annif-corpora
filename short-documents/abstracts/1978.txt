    As universal and mandatory institutions, schools are the first institutional frame of reference newcomer youth encounter upon their arrival in Canada, and as such they play a central role in their settlement process. Although the Quebec Ministry of Education provides guidelines regarding the integration of immigrant students into Quebec educational institutions, some secondary schools in Montreal seem unprepared to respond to theunique needs of newcomer youth.This qualitative case study involving six key informantsreveals that schools need experts from community organizations who have a greater capacity to assist youth in their settlement experiences. However, partnering between school and community organizations are often based on difficult and unequal relationships which have a negative impact on the programs and services offeredto newcomer students. It is crucial that the various ministries involved in the well-being of youth provide long-term funding for collaborative programs targeting newcomers. This could fortify programs that are already implemented, encourage new initiative, and spread them to educational institutions around the province.
