Power Line Communication (PLC) system offers cheaper mode of signal communication facilities.  In fast Fourier transform (FFT) based multicarrier PLC system, a cyclic prefix (CP) of the same length of the channel impulse response is added to each symbol in order to transmit data.  As a result, there is always an inherent wastage of bandwidth and resources.  This research presents a wavelet transform based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (WTOFDM) approach that eliminates the need for these cyclic prefix and improves the efficiency of the PLC transmission.  The presented PLC model is designed for faster and efficient transmission over the power line.  The obtained results indicate that the proposed approach enhances the transmission throughput; provides better performance for impulsive noise, and increases the efficiency of the PLC system as a whole.  In the end a performance comparison of different wavelet techniques have also been incorporated.
