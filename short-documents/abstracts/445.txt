    n this thesis, a newly developed kinetostatic model for modular reconfigurable robots (MRRs) is presented. First, a kinetmatic computational method was created to allow for simple connectivity between modules which included the possibilities of angular offsets. Then, a flexibility analysis was performed to determine the static and dynamic flexibility of link and join modules and the regions of flexibility were plotted to determine exactly which of the components can be considered flexible or rigid, depending on their sizes. Afterwards, the kinetostatic model was developed and compared to a finite element model and results give essentially the same tip deflections between the two models. This kinetostatic model was then used to determine the maximum allowable payload and maximum deflection position for a given MRR. Additionally, a direct method was created to determine the cross section properties of all modules in a given MRR for a given payload and maximum desirable tip deflection.
