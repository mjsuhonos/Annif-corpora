    User fee systems are becoming increasingly popular at local levels of government. By shifting the burden from a tax and spend, to user-pay delivery of services, local governments are able to provide and manage local services with greater efficiency and accountability. A stormwater utility concept has been created for dealing with the often-expensive construction, maintenance, upgrading, and management of storm sewers and associated infrastructure. By examining the various user-pay systems for stormwater management, local governments and researchers can make a more informed decision on whether or not it is an appropriate method to raise revenues. The collection of fees is not based on consumption, as in many other public utilities, but on the property owner's contribution to the problem. Therefore, any user-pay stormwater utility must be easily understood and defensible to the general public. As well, the utility creation, administration, and management process can be aided by the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS). Data can be easily collected, stored, and analyzed, as well as be displayed in a way that is easy to understand, not only by the managers and analysts, but by the general public as well.
