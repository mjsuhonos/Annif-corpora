This study offers evidence for the validity of a new psychometric measure in assessing an individual’s creative motivation and helping to predict their creative performance. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of this new psychometric measure of creative motivation, the Short Scale of Creative Self (SSCS), with several other well established measures of creativity including the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) personality factor “Openness to Experience,” the Creative Personality Scale (CPS), the Creative Behaviour Inventory (CBI), and a divergent thinking task (DT). The SSCS is comprised of two self-concept variables that have been of growing interest and importance in the literature on creativity because of their hypothesized value in capturing key aspects of intrinsic motivation for creativity and thus a form of creative potential that could help predict creative performance. These are creative self-efficacy (CSE) and creative personality identity (CPI), which together are theorized to capture an individual’s creative motivation. The study was conducted on an ethnically diverse sample of 205 adults ranging in age from 18 to 78. Statistical analysis confirmed expected positive correlations between the SSCS and “Openness to Experience,” the CPS, CBI and divergent thinking task. The results of the study support the hypothesis that this new measure, the SSCS, may be a valid measure of creative motivation and may have some potential for helping to predict creative performance. Suggestions are made for future studies to further examine the potential usefulness of the SSCS in relation to other measures of creativity.
