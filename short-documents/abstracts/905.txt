    In recent years many aerospace manufacturing corporations have taken an initiative to eliminate the manual interaction of workers and moving work pieces. At the same time there is an ever-increasing demand for efficiency in the manufacturing sector. The research performed investigates the design and development of passive compliance polishing tools for both external and internal polishing of parts on a CNC turning center. The goal of this thesis is to develop tools that meet new safety demands while at the same time optimizing the tools through the Taguchi method and process planning in order to meet quality standards cost effectively. Experiments on both test pieces and production parts were conducted not only at Ryerson University but at Messier-Dowty as well.
