The topic of this research is examining family dynamics and dual identity. The aim of the research was to analyze whether identity and social construction of ideologies influence family dynamics. It examined how social and internal factors affect a family, focusing on first-generation and second-generation families. This was a qualitative study examining first-generation and second-generation South Asian individuals. I interviewed the individuals using open-ended questions to examine the experiences of adult first-generation Canadians and second-generation Canadians. The study examined how their relationships are affected and influenced by external sources such as school, work, social circles and western ideologies. In conclusion, although themes were common among participants the experience of families and individuals are based on the unique and individualized family.
