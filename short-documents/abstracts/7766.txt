The objective of this study was to assess the mixing performance of a horizontal paddle blender for mono-disperse and bi-disperse particles. The assessment was performed through the application of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations, experiments, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). EDEM 2.7 commercial software was utilized for the mono-disperse simulations while LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC 3.3.1, an open source software, was used for the bi-disperse simulations. DEM models were validated with experimental data. Simulations were performed to explore the effect of impeller rotational speed, vessel fill level, particle number composition, and particle loading arrangement on mixing quality defined by the Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) index. The flow pattern and mixing mechanisms were examined through granular temperature, particle diffusivity, and Peclet number. The impeller rotational speed was the most influential parameter on the mixing performance of mono-disperse particles. The particle number composition was the dominating parameter on the mixing quality of bi-disperse particles
