Investment in ‘next generation’ (very high speed) broadband infrastructure is expected to enable access to services that will provide citizens with social and economic benefits. Developing services for access using broadband infrastructure an be quite complicated however. This paper explores how services can be delivered over broadband network infrastructure, outlining four broad categories of access devices, three service delivery platforms and two types of networks. Using Australian data, the paper explores user behaviours and expectations around service delivery, illustrating the need for diversity and choice of service offerings. It also notes the importance of mobile services, and  takes the case that wireless broadband connectivity should be part of a national broadband infrastructure.
