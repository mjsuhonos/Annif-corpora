    There is an intrinsic relationship between photovoltaic materials and building forms; although there are numerous imaginations and concepts about buildings integrated photovoltaic materials. The relationship between these two components needed to be identified and examined in the process of architectural decision making.
    This thesis explores the relationship between photovoltaic materials and building forms in particular geographical and climatic environments through case studies and then proposes an architectural design project. Based on the research suggestion, the design illustrates how a recreational facility adopts an approximate building form for photovoltaic integration and how the concept is developed. Some implications and principle for solar design are summarized in the final chapter.
