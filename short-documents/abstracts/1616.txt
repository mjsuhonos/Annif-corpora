    Four experiments were designed to assess the effect of ciprofloxacin (cipro) on the function of microbial populations in freshwater environments, specifically on nitrogen cycling. Cipro is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic used in the treatment of both human and veterinary pathogenic diseases. Previous studies reported the presence of cipro in aquatic environments. This study investigates whether cipro has adverse effects on environmental bacteria which perform critical ecosystem processes associated with the nitrogen cycle.  Microcosms containing sediment and synthetic lake water were amended with a series of environmentally relevant concentrations of cipro ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg cipro per kg of sediment. Nitrogen cycling processes including nitrification, denitrification and ammonification were measured using a combination of flux measurements (NH4+, NO3-, NO2-), stable isotope techniques ( 15[superscript]N NO₃- dilution) and changes  in N₂:Ar and O₂:Ar using Membrane Isotope Mass Spectroscopy (MIMS). Results indicate that cipro has a dose-dependent effect on nitrification, while denitrification is dependent on nitrate availability and may be stimulated by cipro. Ammonification and respiration were not affected at these concentrations. Impacts on nitrification and denitrification are likely to be realized only at the highest concentrations measured in the environment. At the lower end of the environmentally relevant concentration range, observed impacts are not likely to be ecologically important, especially when averaged over an entire lake ecosystem.
