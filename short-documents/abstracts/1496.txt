    Advancement in technology has brought considerable improvement to processor design and now manufacturers design multiple processors on a single chip. Supercomputers today consists of cluster of interconnected nodes that collaborate together to solve complex and advanced computation problems. Message Passing Interface and Open Multiprocessing are the popularly used programming models to optimize sequential codes by parallelizing them on the different multiprocessor architecture that exist today. In this thesis, we parallelize the non-slicing floorplan algorithm based on Multilevel Floorplanning/placement of large scale modules using B*tree (MB*tree) with MPI and OpenMP on distributed and shared memory architectures respectively. In VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design automation, floorplanning is an initial and vital task performed in the early design stage. Experimental results using MCNC benchmark circuits show that our parallel algorithm produced better results than the corresponding sequential algorithm; we were able to speed up the algorithm up to 4 times, hence reducing computation time and maintaining floorplan solution quality. On the other hand, we compared both parallel versions; and the OpenMP results gave slightly better than the corresponding MPI results.
