    This Major Research Paper aims at understanding what the settlement experiences and push factors are that contribute to out-migration of Francophone immigrants from Montreal to Toronto. Through a social inclusion framework, and relying on both primary data from key informants and a literature review, this Major Research Paper specifically argues that some Francophone immigrants leave Montreal for Toronto because they perceive that there are systemic barriers to their integration in Quebec, mainly in the labour market, and they believe that the city of Toronto is more open to immigrants and also offers better employment opportunities.
