Cycling is an urban enabler.  It is an innately positive contribution to the urban environment allowing recreation, transport, and travel. Today cycling pathways systems in Toronto are dispersed and fragmented.  Evidence suggests that the bicycle need [sic] be provided with a network, strategized and conceptualized at a higher level so that its enabling function of integrating the urban environment can be achieved.

In Canada and Toronto, cycling development is impeded by a lack of tradition, no federal development support and ad-hoc implementation procedures, ultimately creating unfavourable urban pathways.  This report asserts the critical need to move beyond the ad-hoc implementation of cycling paths towards a comprehensive apprach informed by the objective of integrating the urban environment.  It begins with a review of the current municipal cycling strategy for Toronto, followed by a discussion exploring the changing mobility demands of Toronto, subsequently reviews creative implementation techniques in other jurisdictions and concludes with supplementary policies and guiding principles to inform a revitalized cycling infrastructure strategy in Toronto.
