The thrust profiles of solid rocket motors are usually determined ahead of time by propellant composition and grain design. Traditional techniques for active thrust modulation use a moveable pintle to dynamically change the nozzle throat diameter, increasing the chamber pressure and therefore thrust. With this approach, high chamber pressures must be endured with only modest increases in thrust. Alternatively, it has been shown that spinning a solid rocket motor on its longitudinal axis can increase the burning rate of the propellant and therefore the thrust without the resulting high chamber pressures. Building on prior experience modelling pressure-dependent, low-dependent and acceleration-dependent burning in solid rocket motors, an internal ballistic simulation computer program is modified for the present study where the use of the pintle nozzle and spin-augmented solid rocket motor combustion approaches, for a reference cylindrical-grain motor, are compared. This study confirms that comparable thrust augmentation can be gained at lower chamber pressures using the novel spin-acceleration approach, relative to the established pintle-nozzle approach, thus potentially providing a significant design advantage.
