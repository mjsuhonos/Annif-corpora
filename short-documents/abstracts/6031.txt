This study examines the trajectories and meaning-making of transnationalism for Ghanaian-born young women living in Toronto--a population often silenced and/or categorized within other identities (Tettey & Pampulampu, 2005; Wong, 2000; Yesuf, 2005). This investigation highlights how family, gender, race, and culture inform cross-bordering. Narratives of three Ghanaian-born females living in Brampton identify how Ghanaian-born women
understand what it means to be both Ghanaian and Canadian, and explore how gender, race and culture may inform these understandings. Lastly, this study considers whether the intersection of gender, race and culture complicate Ghanaian female identity. This research illustrates that socio-political circumstances in their country of origin and in Canada shape the women's experiences, life goals and overall practices. In exploring the complexities associated with how gender, culture and race influence identity formation, this research suggests that Ghanaian-born
women are constantly renegotiating and redefining their hyphenated-identities, and their place within Ghana and Canada.

Keywords: Ghanaian-Canadian women, Ghanaian-born, transnational/multiple identities, migration, African-Canadian women.
