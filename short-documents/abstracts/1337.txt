    Smart structures and structural health monitoring are advancing fields that have potential to yield many benefits to many industries and applications. It is important for applicable sensing technologies to mature so that they may be relied upon. Fiber optic sensors are one such sensing method. Their use in fiber reinforced polymer, FRP, composite materials is reviewed and examined, specifically embedded fiber optic sensors. A fabrication method for embedding fiber Bragg grating, FBG, fiber optic sensors in FRP specimens was developed. This fabrication method is then validated through mechanical testing. Initial specimen stiffness's were determined and the results form the FBGs compared well with mechanical resistance strain gauges. The FBG sensors were also successful in detecting drops in stiffness of the specimens when subjected to fatigue loading.
