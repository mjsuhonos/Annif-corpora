    A moving bed biofilm reactor was studied for its capability of carbon oxidation and nitrification. The hybrid system made use of suspended biomass in the forms of microbial aggregates and attached biomass in the form of biofilms on suspended carriers. The carriers used for biofilm support were made of polyethylene and have a wagon wheel shape. The carrier fill ratio, which is defined as the volume ratio of carrier to the whole reactor was a key characteristic parameter of the reactor. The experimental runs used different carrier filling ratios from 25 to 50% to determine the optimal operating value for this type of hybrid reactor. Also the nutrient conditions were modified to test the capacity of the system to adapt to various changes in phosphorus loading in the influent wastewater. The results showed that for an influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 600 mg/L, ammonia of about 24 mg/L and hydraulic reaction time of 6 hours there was no difference in the performance of the system under the different carrier filling rations.
