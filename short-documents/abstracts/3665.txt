Due to the increased worldwide demand for electricity, governments and policy makers are looking to identify tools to help reduce household energy consumption. This study examines the relationship between the empirical and attitudinal variables and the likelihood of implementation of household energy conservation measures and investments, using a wide data set involving household level characteristic from 10,252 respondents from ten different countries (Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden). Moreover, the effects of time varying electricity pricing on household energy saving measures and investments is evaluated. Using the multivariable probit model, this project makes comparison across the ten countries incorporating socio-demographic characteristics, and allows for the potential correlation between energy saving decisions (measures and investments).
