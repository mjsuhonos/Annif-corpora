Augmented Reality (AR) combines a live camera view of a real world environment with computer-generated virtual content. Alignment of these viewpoints is done by recognizing artificial fiducial markers, or, more recently, natural features already present in the environment. This is known as Marker-based and Markerless AR respectively.
We present a markerless AR system that is not limited to artificial markers, but is capable of rendering augmentations over user-selected textured surfaces, or ‘maps’. The system stores and differentiates between multiple maps, all created online. Once recognized, maps are tracked using a hybrid algorithm based on feature matching and inlier tracking.
With the increasing ubiquity and capability of mobile devices, we believe it is possible to perform robust, markerless AR on current generation tablets and smartphones. The proposed system is shown to operate in real-time on mobile devices, and generate robust augmentations under a wide range of map compositions and viewing conditions.
