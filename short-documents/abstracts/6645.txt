Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars are used in bridge decks to overcome the problem of corrosion of steel bars and concrete spalling. However, design guidelines for joints between GFRPreinforced precast deck panels supported over girders for accelerated bridge replacement is as yet unavailable. The proposed research investigates the use of GFRP bars in the closure strip between jointed precast deck panels, which is filled with ultra-high performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC). Four different bar splice lengths in the joint were considered in this study, namely:
75, 105, 135 and 165 mm, with bar splice spacing taken as 0, 75 and 100 mm. 27 specimens were constructed and tested to-collapse to determine their structural behavior and load carrying capacity. Correlation between experimental findings and available design equations for moment and shear capacities was conducted, leading to recommendations for the use of the proposed joints between precast deck panels in slab-on-girder bridges.
