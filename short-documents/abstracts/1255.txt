    English language learners (ELLs) in classrooms is becoming a common occurrence with Ontario's escalating immigration trends. This influx pressures teachers who encounter barriers and indadequate training for linguistically diverse needs. Teacher education has the potential to overcome these barriers through effective ELL training. This qualitative study explores current teacher preparation practices through pre-service teachers' (PT)perspectives. This study aims to address a Canadain literature void by exploring how prepared primary-junior PTs are to teach ELLs in Southwestern Ontario. Using a structured interview, six certified graduates shared descriptive experiences, knowledge and beliefs. The findings are organized as; 1)Faculties of Education. 2)PTs' Beliefs, 3)In Future Classrooms and 4)Beyond the Classroom. Although moving towards greater ELL awareness and inclusive mindsets, there is a good indication that well-intentioned teachers lack the competence necessary for effective classroom practice. This exploration is an initial step towards a better understanding of teacher preparation.
