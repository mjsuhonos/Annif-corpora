    The stories of the women who lived in and contributed to the growth of early Victorian Canada have been largely untold. Often named only as an adjunct to male heads of households, women have been nearly invisible in the history of this nation. This research project is a study of the women and their dress from 1840 to 1860 as seen through daguerreotypes. It verifies that sitters showed a high level of consistency in their choice of style, fabric, and accessories, but exhibited individuality and personality within the confines of popular fashion. Using information gleaned from the photographs, this examination identifies signs and symbols that were part of the philosophy of early Victorian Canada. As a scholarly document, it provides a series of images that can be used to establish the timelines of Canadian dress and a firm base upon which to build a greater knowledge of Canadian fashion.
