    IP mobility solutions allow mobile nodes to roam while retaining connectivity to the internet. However, as these solutions evolve, mobile node implementations continue to undergo modification. Since mobile nodes represent hundreds of thousands of hosts worldwide, deploying new mobility protocols will become expensive.     The main objective of this project was to design a framework that decouples the mobile node from route repair, which reduces the implementation and deployment time of new solutions. The proposed framework reengineers existing IP mobility protocols in order to facilitate the transition for network administrators. The second objective of the project was to provide a prototype of the framework to gain acceptance for our design within the Internet community. The result of this work is a mobility management framework that not only reduces the effects of deployment, but also provides a standard interface to the mobile node.
