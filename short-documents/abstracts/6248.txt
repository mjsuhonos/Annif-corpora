Due to the adverse economic conditions in Mexico and the need for offshore labour in Canadian agriculture, Mexico entered the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP) in 1974 as a source country, becoming the country that exports the highest number of agricultural works to Canada. While abroad, these workers have genuine needs that should be addressed by the Mexican government, but unfortunately the Mexican government has failed to provide adequate protection to its nationals. This paper offers an overview of the situation in rural Mexico, the operational aspects of the program and its violations; it identifies the workers' needs and the most important national and international documents that regulate the protection of nationals abroad. This research is a critique of the role of the Mexican government in the protection of the seasonal agricultural workes in Canada, identifying the limitations that the State faces for providing protection to its nationals.
