Recent growth within the craft brewing industry has increased employment and economic
growth in Ontario, and has also raised social and environmental concerns. The purpose of
this thesis was to explore the application of a self-regulatory model within the Ontario craft
brewing industry to improve sustainability performance. Based on a literature review, two
content analyses, interviews with craft breweries, and interviews with sustainability
certification administrators, the viability, content, and organization of a self-regulatory
model has been considered. Findings suggest that a sustainability certification scheme
grounded in a public report may be a viable governance mechanism for craft breweries in
Ontario to adopt, and may result in improved sustainability performance within firms. A
proposal for a guideline, requirements, and a list of indicators for a sustainability
certification scheme is presented.
