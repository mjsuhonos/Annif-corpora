Although community service programs are to be found across the Canadian landscape, there have been no national initiatives to standardize programs. Thus, the place and nature of community service in high school curricula vary significantly among the 13 educational jurisdictions in Canada. The greatest differences however, are to be found among individual schools within each jurisdiction. This paper presents findings from interviews with key-informants to provide a more in-depth portrait of the programs in Canadian schools. Community service practices in Canadian schools are then discussed in the context of “best practices” as described in the literature
