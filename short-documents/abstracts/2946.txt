The motivation of this research is to apply audio description to films designed for or about the Chinese community. It aims to examine the differences and similarities of expectations and evaluations of audio description between the Chinese and Canadian communities. An integrated audio described film was produced for the film, ‘Magical Coincidence’. Two phases of interviews were conducted among Chinese and Canadian participants. The results show that differences exist not only in nationalities, but also in genders. This research confirms the necessity of applying audio description to films for the Chinese community, and provides suggestions for the production process.
