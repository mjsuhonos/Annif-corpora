This study aimed to explore the impact of the Places to Grow Plan 2006 on travel behavior of the work commuters living in GTHA. A comparative analysis was done between the year 2001 and 2011 which represent the situations five year before and after the implementation of the Plan. Data were collected from Transportation Tomorrow Survey. The study revealed that in 2011, energy consumption by motorized vehicles increased in the Traffic Assessment Zones of GTHA around the Growth Centres designated by the Places to Grow Plan. Active transportation increased mainly in Toronto in 2011. It is apprehended that the intensification strategy of the Places to Grow Plan contributed in increasing the energy consumption of work commuters either by increasing the number of trips or length of trips made by motorized vehicles (including cars and different forms of transit) which also affect the Greenhouse Gas emissions in the atmosphere.
