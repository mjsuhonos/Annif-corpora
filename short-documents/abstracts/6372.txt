Computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical modeling of many natural systems in science and engineering.  Simulations can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology, and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions.  BIOPLUME III is a numerical two-dimensional model that tracks the fate and transport of aromatic hydrocarbons.  To help the environmental professional with the data management, visualization, and decision making tasks involved.  Interpretations based on model analyses must recognize the significance of uncertainties in input data.  Models of ground-water systems should be regarded as just one tool among many that can be used in the analysis of a ground-water quality problem.  Numerical simulation can help the analyst integrate available data, evaluate conceptual models, test hypotheses pertaining to flow and quality changes, and predict system responses to alternative stresses.  The models do not replace field data, but they help to guide the design of a more effective and more efficient data-collection program.
