"In an effort to increase representation and visibility of the “in between” people and connect my experience to others I began interviewing individuals who were also culturally hybridized. The final iteration of these interviews became a short documentary film titled “Hyphen”, which attempts to represent the perspective of experiencing the world through a fractured/divided sense of self, how people create a sense of belonging for themselves and ultimately how they try and bridge the gaps of understanding between the divided worlds they embody. In this essay I intend to elaborate on my theoretical and field research leading up to the film, my influences and considerations when forming it and finally evaluate its final impact as a finished product."--Introduction.
