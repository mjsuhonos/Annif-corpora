Architecture has traditionally served as a tool with which to support human occupation of the built environment. This approach however, neglects the ways in which the environment conversely affects human behavior and experience. Through the exploration of this reciprocal relationship, the thesis will attempt to engage in an architecture of the lived world.
Place, a prominent premise of this lived world, is dependent on the relations between social and spatial components. In order for a community to operate successfully, it must facilitate the interactions of these components, operating as a socio-spatial network. The findings of this design research will be manifested through an intervention in a local community where the physical environment has contributed to its decline.
