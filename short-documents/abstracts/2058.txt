    Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a lethal cardiac arrhythmia and electric shock is the only available treatment option for it. Existing works focus on predicting shock success to help improve cardiac resuscitation outcomes. It is desirable to extract information from the electrograms that relates to the current theories on VF mechanism and associate them to the prediction of shock outcomes. To this effect this study used a unique human VF database to evaluate the independent sources (ISs) extracted from Blind Source Separation approach (BSS) and a correlation of 88% was observed between the dominant ISs extracted using a single lead ECG with the number of rotors (i.e., sources identified using multi-channel spatio-temporal phase maps) supporting the hypothesis that the ISs are associated with the rotors. In predicting the shock outcomes using features extracted from the ISs for the given database, we achieved a classification accuracy of 68%.
