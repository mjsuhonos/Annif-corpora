    How essential is it to understand the local context in a globalized world? Globalization is a rapid traversing of ideas, attitudes and values across national borders that lead to an interconnectedness and interaction between peoples of diverse cultures and ways of life.
    What if the local architectural mosaic depends on strengthening the capacity to invite people with different backgrounds and ideas to establish a connection to their heritage, whilst at the same time complying with globalized architecture? Is there a way to combine the freedom and flexibility of local cultures with the restrictive and regulatory influence of a globalized hierarchy?
    This thesis explores the architecture that emerges out of the hybridization of multiple forces to be both locally unique and globally adaptable.
