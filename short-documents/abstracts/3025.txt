This paper considers regulatory reform in Jamaica's telecommunication industry. "Currently, Jamaican telecommunication operates under a multi-sector regulator, the Office of Utility Regulation (OUR), which has oversight of all public utilities including telecommunications, water, gas, and electricity. The reform under consideration in Jamaica is the transition towards a single-sector independent regulator, referred to throughout this research as the integrated regulator, with monitoring responsibility for converged media services, including broadcasting and Information Communication Technology (ICT)"--From the introduction, page 7.
