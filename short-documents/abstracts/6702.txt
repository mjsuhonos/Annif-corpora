A programmable wide-range PLL has been designed that can provide 100-MHz to 1-GHz rail-to-rail digital clock signal from a 50-MHz reference clock. The architecture is appropriate for low-power design and is also power-efficient.        
The system is robust against temperature changes so that the stability of the system is guaranteed. Because of the differential configuration of the sub-blocks and using a voltage-controlled oscillator with a 1Ow. gain and a linear transfer function the system has an acceptable noise rejection.
