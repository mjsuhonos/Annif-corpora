    There are three dominant noise mechanisms in an analog optical fiber link. These are shot noise that is proportional to the mean optical power, relative intensity noise (RIN) that is proportional to the square of the instanteaneous optical power. This report describes an adaptive noise cancellation of these dominant noise processes that persist an analog optical fiber link. The performance of an analog optical fiber link is analyzed by taking the effects of these noise processes. Analytical and simulation results show that some improvement in signal to noise ratio (SNR) and this filter is effective to remove noise adaptively from the optical fiber link.
