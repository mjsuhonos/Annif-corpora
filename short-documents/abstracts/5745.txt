The development of ocularcentric culture can be traced through the modes and history of representation. The omnipotence of form and a visual aesthetic within contemporary architecture parallels this notion of visual primacy. The role of imagery within contemporary design practice is twofold: it is both a tool for investigating spatial realities and the product of a systematic design process. Emotive spaces are created when perceptual phenomena are in the vanguard rather than the aftermath of constructed objects. Through the reconsideration of image, as a multi-dimensional design tool, the spatial realities of the built context are investigated. Within film and contemporary media, architectural imagery combines with the temporal realm to enrich user perceptions of the built environment. The restoration of architecture as a communicative medium is facilitated by restructuring its current model from a formal object generated by a system of abstract geometries into a perceptual model.
