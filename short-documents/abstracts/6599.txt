This thesis establishes the benefits of multi-architecture systems by using reconfigurable modules in conjunction with a case integration strategy to improve system performance. The modules and strategies discussed in this thesis provide
opportunities to the improve system performance of processing units designed for the consumer market.
The primary objective for this work is to improve the performance of consumer processors using programmable logic, while ensuring the changes are abstracted from operating systems and software applications. This thesis accomplishes this using specified integration strategies, protocols and through optimization of device drivers.
