This thesis presents an experimental investigation into the response of a cantilever beam experiencing axial flow induced vibrations with the free boundary condition at upstream. The acceleration of the beam was captured at two locations using MEMS based accelerometers. The experimental results were compared with known characteristics of each of the three types of responses known to result from flow induced vibrations in axial flow. The observed phenomena can be classified as non-resonant buffeting response driven by the turbulent flow of the fluid.
