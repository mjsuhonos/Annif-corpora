    Energy used by primary and secondary Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems in post-secondary schools can account for a significant share of the total energy expenditure throughout the lifetime of these buildings. The following is a study of a Ryerson University buildings’ Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning system through the use of eQUEST energy modelling techniques. A baseline energy model was created and was compared to the buildings’ existing energy consumption, and energy intensity benchmarks. Suggested improvements to the existing Variable Air Volume system were determined by comparing the baseline VAV eQUEST simulation against two subsequent hydronic based eQUEST models; the Fan Coil System, and the Water Source Heat Pump System.
