Interior space comfort encompasses design performance criteria beyond the thermal qualities of the space. The acoustic performance has shown to be an essential factor for the productivity levels of the users of the space, and is essential for overall indoor environment quality to be maintained. This research focuses on the potential of integrating living walls within indoor spaces, such as atriums and halls, to provide a passive strategy for noise insulation. The procedure is conducted through a series of acoustic measurements and calculations to determine the sound absorption coefficient of living walls in-situ. A case study space is used to evaluate the integration of living walls to provide acoustic comfort.
