    This study examined the cultural resources of Afghan migrants and their relationship to the experience of resilience. The study explores the integration process of Afghan migrants as a way of gaining insight into their cultural values, beliefs and characteristics that play a role in facilitating their resilience. Participants in the study included six adult newcomer Afghans (1 Male and 5 Females) who have resided in Canada for over one year and under ten years. They were interviewed separately using open-ended in-depth interviews. The analysis of the interviews resulted in two core themes (1) Personal coping strategies and (2) Cultural resources as coping strategies. The results determined that Afghans utilize some aspects of cultural collectivity, as well as positive cultural values and characteristics when dealing with the adversities of settlement and adaptation.
