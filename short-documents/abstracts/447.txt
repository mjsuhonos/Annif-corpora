    This study will attempt to analyze the effectiveness of the immigration point system in selecting immigrants. The development of the system within the historical context will be explored as well as the changes that have occurred since its creation until the most recent alterations. Interviews, with a range of opinions, will be analyzed to compliment [sic] secondary data to assess the impacts which have resulted from the point system through its design, operation and theory. These sources will also be used to provide suggestions and recommendations on how the point system could be improved to maximize effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to add to the growing body of literature surrounding this topic and to determine if the point system is indeed an effective method of selection.
