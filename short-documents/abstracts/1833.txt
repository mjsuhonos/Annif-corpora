    Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) is an ultra ductile concrete with strain-hardening and multiple-cracking behaviour in tension and flexure. Fresh, mechanical and durability properties of different ECC mixtures are evaluated by incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (class F, CI fly ash and slag) and different aggregate type. Experimental studies demonstrated viability of producing greener, sustainable and cost-effective ECC using locally available aggregates (crushed sand) instead of microsilica sand and fly ash (Class CI or F) of up to 70% cement replacement having similar or better fresh, mechanical and durability properties. Structural validation by small scale tests on bridge decks with ECC link slab and by push out tests to evaluate stud shear connector-ECC interaction compared with self-consolidating concrete (SCC) proved feasibility and advantages of these ECC mixes. Based on research, recommendations are made for ECC mix design and their application in link slab construction in bridge structures.
