    Increasing development in absence of management can impact the environmental and social welfare of host communities. Collaboration is often used as a tool to mitigate the negative consequences of development, while allowing for the implementation of solutions which benefit a range of individuals who may have differing perspectives. This study examines the perceived consequences of increasing development in Santa Catalina, Panama, and the opportunity for collaboration to mitigate these effects. Stakeholder and collaboration theory were used to inform data analysis, but difficulties accessing government and local people limited the ability of these theories to be applied. Although this study explores the opportunity for collaboration within the business sector, perspectives from all stakeholders remains necessary for the overall success of collaboration. Maintaining access to reliable informants, ensuring adequate time for data collection, and increasing education may reduce conflict and improve communication, leadership and participation; improving the overall success of destination management.
