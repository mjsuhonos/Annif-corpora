Cloud service broker (CSB) as an emerging technology intermediates heterogeneous multiple cloud services for both the providers and consumers. Recently, Cloud computing & mobile cloud computing applications (MCA) have gained an enormous popularity, which has led to an increasing need for the development of platform independent Middleware/CSB to support all types of cloud service consumer applications including x86*x64 based standard OS & ARM based mobile applications, web browsers, etc. Developing Platform Independent Hybrid CSB, however, is not an easy task. Developers have to deal with difficulties inherent from the different cloud controllers, cloud service providers environments, clients’ application types, network connection types (wired, wireless), GPS (Global Positioning Systems) information of cloud resources and clients’ etc.
In this thesis, the proposed design of a middleware/CSB that abstracts the real-time resources of various clouds (private, public, home, Local) and stores the resources in its own Database. It will also store clients requests then analyzes the request to find the nearest available servers which is running the appropriate applications. Then the CSB will forward the destination servers information to the clients. Thesis goal is to achieve context awareness, location awareness, platform independence, portability, efficiency, and usability. Portability is achieved by following the J2ME platform specifications. The middleware has been implemented and tested on a real time Openstack cloud using by our newly designed Android Clients and platform independent Mozilla Firefox browser. The performance measurements of the middleware show that it achieves its efficiency requirements. Furthermore, the middleware’s database can be used for resource algorithm, pattern analysis, and for future requirements.
