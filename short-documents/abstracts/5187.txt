The project verifies the performance of a control system designed for a Series Resonant Converter (SRC). A discrete small-signal model of an SRC was derived and used to design the control system. An accurate control system was designed in the frequency domain to eliminate the need for trail-and-error [sic] methods or other time domain methods. A PSPICE simulation of a regulated SRC circuit was used to test the control system. A prototype of the regulated SRC was developed to verify the simulated results. The tests performed demonstrated that the control system design provides a quick response. The tests determined that when a step input is applied to the reference input the control system adjusts the SRC's output voltage to the new reference input value. Also, the control system is able to regulate output load voltage in the presence of sudden load changes.
