Purpose: To examine the extent to which senior nursing leaders report the presence of components of organizational capacity that support research use; and to describe the facilitators and barriers to research utilization.
Methods: A survey method involving a sample of 43 senior nursing leaders was used in this descriptive study.
Results: The components that participants reported as most frequently available were organizational culture and values and supporting continuing professional development. The components that were reported as least frequently available were setting priorities for obtaining research and assessing quality and applicability of research. The top three facilitators were: networks, availability of resources and organizational support. The top three barriers were: lack of resources, an unsupportive organization and RN attitudes/beliefs.
Conclusions: The results of this study highlight the need for organizations to consider culture and values, leadership support, education and training and resource allocation in order to increase organizational capacity to support research utilization
