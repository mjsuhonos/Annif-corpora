    An acoustic chamber was designed for testing structure-borne sound transmission in a double-panel assembly induced by point connectors. Several vibration isolators were tested and the overall effects on the noise transmitted through the assembly were predicted by establishing the link between the vibratory acceleration level (VAL) and the sound pressure level (SPL). A detailed assessment of the acoustic chamber showed that a major modification of the double-panel assembly is required before the acoustic performance of this assembly could be evaluated directly using insertion loss (IL) measurements where the sound pressure level (SPL) difference is the performance indicator. This thesis describes the assessment findings and retrofitting options. It is concluded that adjustments to the VAL-to-SPL relation are required to account for distance, radiation efficiency, and room effects. Further adjustments to the acoustic chamber are required to enhance its performance.
