Proper pre-migration planning could assist individuals in post-migration settlement.  This paper explores the unique pre-migration experience of six Chinese immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area.  The study attempts to examine whether pre-migration planning alleviates some of the negative impact of migration and assists in settlement of Chinese immigrants in Canada.  In the case of the Chinese immigrants in this study, there are indications that pre-migration planning has prepared the participants for the various barriers that they encountered during their initial settlement stages.  Key words:  Chinese immigrants, pre-migration planning, post-migration settlement.
