    This major research paper is an analysis of a fictional novel, by Manju Kapur, using the two main themes of transnational habitus and patriarchy as reflected in the novel. This paper aims to understand how one immigrant womanâ€Ÿs identities are transformed within her transnational habitus. Although relatively stereotypical of the issues that prevail through Indian immigrant fiction, the above reinforces the issues immigrant women face and calls to attention the need for these issues to be acknowledged and addressed.
