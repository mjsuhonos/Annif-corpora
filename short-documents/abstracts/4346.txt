This thesis presents a reconfigurable Ground Control Station designed for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle use, which utilizes multi-touch gesture inputs as well as the ability for the operator to personalize where the instruments they interact with are located on screen. The Ground Control Station that is presented was designed and developed in Ryerson University’s Mixed-Reality Immersive Motion Simulation Laboratory utilizing commercial off the shelf programs supplied by Presagis. Presagis’ VAPS XT 4.1 beta was used to design and develop the actual Ground Control Station’s User Interface due to its ability to create high quality interfaces for aircraft that harness multi-touch gestures. While FlightSIM 14 was used to simulate a high fidelity aircraft being controlled by the Ground Control Station. The final interface was comprised of six key features and 12 different instrument panels that could be manipulated by the operator to control a simulated aircraft throughout a virtual environment.
