    Effective management of stormwater is critical to the continued health of the environment. Progression of stormwater management techniques has evolved to include wider, sustainable objectives, particularly the development of Low Impact Development (LID) methods. Despite the recognition that the application of LID practices is a viable approach to older forms of stormwater management, there exist various challenges and barriers to widespread support. In particular, absent is a methodology to plan for LID practices on a large-scale that encompasses not only technical criteria, but economical, and social aspects as well. To address this need, the objective of this study proposes a framework for LID planning on a watershed level. The LID planning Framework is comprised of four main components evaluated in a sequential process to support the development of effective management strategies. Specifically, hydrological performance evaluation of LID technologies throughout a watershed; cost-effectiveness analysis; and stakeholdersâ€™ opinions and acceptance levels of these technologies, are used as input to the final decision-making component. The LID Planning Framework is developed in an Ontario context with a particular focus on the Lake Simcoe Watershed. This study will promote an integrated approach to LID planning, which can be used support the uptake of LID principles and encourage more sustainable methods in stormwater management as a whole.
