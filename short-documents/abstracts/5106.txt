The purpose of this research was to explore accessibility and how older adults in suburban communities are participating in social activities outside their home. Twenty older adults in Mississauga, Ontario took part in this study. A combination of activity-based travel diaries and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Findings suggest that understandings of accessibility vary between users of different transportation modes. Further, travel time rather than distance travelled may be a more significant indicator of participation. Land use mix also attracts participation, while conditions that risk the health and safety of older adults are deterrents. This research contributes to the limited literature on older adult social participation as related to transportation. Results from this study highlight potential problems for older adult accessibility in a suburban context. Research may inform the development of accessibility interventions, municipal land use policies, and public transit strategies to build healthier, more
inclusive age-friendly communities.
