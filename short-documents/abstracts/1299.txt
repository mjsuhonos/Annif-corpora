    Traditional ultrasound imaging monitors the backscattering properties of the object being imaged. Many hybrid imaging techniques such as photo-acoustic imaging, electro-acoustic imaging etc. have been developed to enhance the contrast in imaging. The main objective of this study was to monitor the electrically induced mechanical changes (EIMC) in ultrasound phantoms. Changes in time shifting of the signals and amplitude changes were investigated. Images were formed using a linear array ultrasound probe based on the time-delay estimates and the amplitude changes occurring in the tissue/phantom structure. EIMC in phantoms were found to depend on the applied electric field, gelling agent concentration, and salt concentration. The dependence of EIMC on the various parameters can be explained by the stiffness and fixed charge densities (FCD) of the phantoms. Knowledge gained from experimental results and its future extensions might culminate to form a method to image tissues based on their electrokinetic properties.
