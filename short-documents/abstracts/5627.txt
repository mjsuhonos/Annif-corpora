This paper takes a high level investigation of what elements and considerations are needed to develop a formalized process for idea generation and evaluation for continuous improvement in a major transit agency. A detailed analysis was undertaken of the past and current processes and organizational structures at TriMet (Portland, Oregonâ€™s transit agency) to develop an innovation framework to enhance employee engagement and encourage idea generation internally with staff and externally with community partners. This study was informed by a literature review, documentation of case studies on existing continuous improvement and innovation frameworks in four comparable American transit agencies and in person semi structured interviews of TriMet staff from across the agency. A series of twelve recommendations informed by research, staff interviews and analysis discusses how existing processes and structures could be integrated into a formalized innovation framework for the transit agency.
