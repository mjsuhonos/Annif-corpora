    Magnesium (Mg) alloys present a promising alternative to aluminum (Al) alloys in lightweight applications. However, relative to Al alloys, Mg alloys have poor castability. Castability is influenced significantly by the dendrite coherency point (DCP), which represents the temperature, time, and solid fraction at which an interlocking solid network forms during solidification. An increase in the solid fraction at coherency may improve the castability of the alloy and reduce casting defects such as porosity, hot tears and misruns. A successful method for increasing the solid fraction at the DCP in Al alloys involves the use of grain refiners such as titanium (Ti). However, the influence of Ti refiners on the DCP in Mg alloys has not been thoroughly investigated. The objective of this research was to study the effect of Al-5Ti-1B refiner on the dendrite growth mechanism, DCP and porosity of AZ91E magnesium alloy. This thesis is a pioneering effort in relating the grain refinement effect of Ti on the DCP, coherency solid fraction, and porosity development during the solidification of Mg alloy, AZ91E. It represents an important step in improving the castability of Mg alloys. Varying levels of Al-5Ti1B grain refiner (0.005, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 wt.% Ti) were added to AZ91E. The effect of Al-5Ti-1B grain refiner on the microstructure and dendrite growth mechanism of AZ91E was investigated. Quench experiments were performed to observe transformations in the dendritic morphology that resulted from the refiner additions. The growth rate and DCP were determined using the rheological method. The changes in porosity levels were determined for the grain refiner additions.
