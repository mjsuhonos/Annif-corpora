    In the world of business special attention is paid to entrepreneurs for their potential and large corporations for their impact on the market. Due to this, small businesses often fall short of resources and tools to help them grow.
    The aim of this dissertation is to introduce a framework for decision making to small businesses as a tool to help embed more structure into their organization.
    The framework was then applied to two distinct case studies to display its functionality and usefulness. The framework consists of several steps:
    1) corporate plan and financial assessment 2) a current state analysis 3) a quantitative and mathematical feasibility study of the decision
    The framework in each case study resulted in an objective and qualified decision. It also suggests that, due to the unique structure and characteristics of each small business, the framework proposed would only be relevant and applicable on a general level and more work is required to refine the details in order to be able apply it universally to business entities with limited working capital.
