    High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes are one [of] the most commonly used methods to reduce the number of vehicles on the road network. HOV provides a faster and reliable option to single occupancy vehicles, thus inducing more people to car pool. The success of HOV lanes depends on the reduction of travel time and increased trip reliability. Therefore, in order to reduce travel time and improve trip reliability this study emphasizes on the HOV access location relative to an access ramp. In this case we have chosen the interchange at Erin Mills Parkway and Highway 403 as a subject of our study. The study was divided into 2 parts, namely the field review and simulation of different options in order to optimize the HOV access location. During the field review it was found that 75% of the vehicles are in a position to enter the HOV lane 200m upstream of the exiting access location. Also, approximately 35% of vehicles were jumping the buffer before the start of the access location. In the second part of the study a total of 6 options were explored using VISSIM micro simulation software. The results of the simulation showed that the access location 200m downstream of the Speed Change Lane with a total access length of 600m is the best option. In addition, it was found that buffer separated HOV lane operate better then HOV lane without a buffer zone. This can be attributed to the increase of HOV lane for short trips, which increases the traffic volume on the HOV lane.
