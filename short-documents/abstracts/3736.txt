The project presents a new vision for the Western Toronto Waterfront. The project proposes a design to reimagine the forgotten territories in Parkdale and reconnect the historic waterfront resort community to Lake Ontario. Using tools supplied by landscape urbanism and the architectural practice of landform building, the project seeks to reimagine the territories left abandoned because of their close proximity to road and rail infrastructure.
