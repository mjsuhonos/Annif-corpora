    The present paper provides a systematic review of the current literature on parent-child connectedness (PCC) through a critical analysis of existing research on the topic. By focusing on the numerous ways the construct of PCC extends beyond the scope of traditional attachment theory, this paper attempts to make PCC more relevant to individuals of varied age, gender, culture and socioeconomic backgrounds. An explanation of PCC as a dependent variable is presented as a means of strengthening the understanding of the construct, and an extensive evaluation of its theoretical foundations is included in order to operationalize this understanding. This paper concludes by suggesting the benefit in broadening the awareness of PCC and by providing recommendations for future research.
