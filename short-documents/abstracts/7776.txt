There is a debate between land owners, who think their property should be approved for higher height permissions of zoning by-laws due to being located close to a transit station, and policy makers who want to consider potential future developments in a way to suit the whole area. This study tries to establish a methodology and provide a decision making tool by introduction of a land-use and transportation interaction (LUTI) model considering all the involved aspects such as a number of settled households, their income level, number of employments and categorization, travel preferences and inventory of housing.   
The goal is to observe what housing demand changes will occur, where and what types are most wanted, at the smallest currently possible level of census dissertation area (DA) for conditional scenarios of before and after completion of major transit projects of light-rail transit (LRT) and subway in the study area.
