Radio over fiber has become one of the most useful technologies for providing extended coverage of wireless communications services. ROF uses analog fiber optic links to distribute wireless radio signals from a central location to multiple remote locations where the added desired antennas are placed for stronger signal coverage. The adaptive predistortion technique of a LASER ROF chip is implemented using the digital IC design flow. The design flow can be separated into two main parts, namely the RTL design / synthesis and the generation of the actual chip. 
  The first part in the design flow consists of generating the proper logical functionality of the IC using a hardware description language (HDL), namely VHDL or Verilog, and synthesizing the code to ensure proper operation. The second part in the design flow consists of floorplanning and physical layout of the ASIC.
