This research paper is a qualitative study of how urban and rural children (6-8 years) experience the natural environment. The literature exploring how place of residence can influence environmental awareness and pro-environmental behaviour among children has been contradictory. This study attempted to explore this question in order to establish any differences between the two sample groups. Semi-structured interviews and drawing analyses were used to examine the children's view of the natural environment and their knowledge of environmentally responsible behaviours. The results indicate that the urban children were more knowledgeable of environmentally responsible behaviours and displayed higher levels of environmental advocacy.  These findings support the use of area-specific environmental teaching strategies that may serve to promote environmental awareness and advocacy among children residing in any location.
