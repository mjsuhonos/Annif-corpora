During the development of the nervous system, neurons are guided to their final targets by several well-known guidance cues.  In Caenorhabditis elegans the expression of the UNC-6/Netrin guidance cue along the ventral cord attracts axons that express UNC-40, while repulsing axons that express both the UNC-5 and UNC-40 receptors.  Lack of both UNC-40 and the novel protein ENU-3 enhanced the ventral guidance defects of the AVM and PVM (Yee et al., 2014).  This suggests that ENU-3 functions in an UNC-6 dependent pathway parallel to UNC-40 in controlling migrations towards the ventral nerve cord.  Mutations in all proteins of the ENU-3 family also enhance the motor neuron axon outgrowth defects of strains lacking UNC-6 or the UNC-5 receptor, thus they function in a parallel unknown pathway (Yee et al., 2011).  Expression analyses in HeLa cells have determined that ENU-3 and one of its paralogs, C38D4.1 localize to the nuclear membrane/ER while another of its paralogs, K01G5.3 is an intracellular membrane-associated protein.
