    Through Metrolinx, the province of Ontario seeks to change the sprawling, car dependent character of The Greater Toronto and Hamilton Areas by introducing a vast network of rapid transit routes along a series of corridors, linked by a series of nodes, called mobility hubs. Following Smart Growth principles, these hubs should be buttressed by transit supportive land-use regulations, but the current land-use planning framework in the region makes such changes difficult. By implementing a little used tool in Ontario's Planning Actcalled development permit systems (DPS), the author argues that municipalities can better facilitate development around mobility hubs in a transit supportive manner that is keeping with the complex mobility hub guidelines outlined by Metrolinx. With both its flexible zoning criteria that focuses public consultations at the outset of the planning process and its expedited approvals process, DPS would facilitate transit oriented development at Metrolinx's mobility hubs.
