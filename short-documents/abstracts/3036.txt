Land is a finite resource which does not support the low density suburban model on a large scale. The alternative, the urban condition, does not satisfy the needs of families. The goal is to define a middle ground, to create a hybrid, by taking the best qualities of the suburbs and urb to develop a new vision for the city. Is it possible to combine the typological characteristics and spatial qualities of the suburbs in an urban format where the disadvantages of the suburbs are mitigated by the multiplicity of urbanity? For the purpose of this thesis the design proposal is tested on Ijburg, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The resultant hybrid is manifested through the mixing of different housing typologies both suburban and urban in conjunction with and elevated street which provides private access to individual units and public access to recreational and leisure facilities.
