Analysis of elliptic conductors, carrying a known total current, using the point matching method (PMM) in circular-cylinder coordinates [l] failed for the values of axes ratio b / a < 05, where a and b are the major and minor axes of the ellipse, respectively. This work shows that the use of elliptic-cylinder coordinates in conjunction with the point matching method overcomes this problem. This paper is a part of the work investigating the difficulties encountered in the point matching method, and is motivated by the fact that, despite its limitations, the method is still attractive as suggested by its use in recent papers [2]-141.
