This thesis argues that if we as a society value the free expression of social and political matters, our built environment needs to provide more accessible opportunities for individuals or groups to produce their own spatial expression. 

In contemporary societies, wealth presents the power to frame the spatial conditions of our living environment. The presence of commercial and economic power overshadows the needs for individual expression through the production of space.

Based on theories concerning the spatialization of power and the production of space developed by Michel Foucault and Henri Lefebvre, this thesis will propose an architectural response for the spatial existence of free expression in Toronto. It aims to manifest the power of civic action that transforms social and political narratives. In addition, it will propose an architectural intervention designed to express and facilitate the exercise of collective action that challenges the dominant narrative in society.
