While the importance of disabled children’s rights, well-being, and interests are frequently
discussed internationally, how they are incorporated in services is rarely mentioned. This study
explores traditional and non-traditional approaches by interviewing two community-based
service-providers to illuminate which approach comes closer to ensuring disabled children’s
rights, well-being, and interests. Thematic analysis produced findings that acknowledged the
extent to which the services differ including: service provided, program plans, benefits, and
approach to challenges with children. The traditional approach positions disabled children as
silent actors by taking control and by its formal structure. The non-traditional approach
acknowledges disabled children as social actors by incorporating ways for children to exercise
control of their own lives and by its informality, which promotes disabled children’s
individuality. These factors suggest the non-traditional approach comes closer to ensuring
disabled children’s rights, well-being, and interests. Implications are significant for reconsidering
practice and policies in the hope that disabled children’s rights in services are ensured for future
generations.
