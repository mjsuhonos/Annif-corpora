    This thesis is an applied project in which a finding aid was created for the set of George Streynsham Master's albums held in the Richard and Ronay Menschel Library at George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film. The collection consists of twenty-one travel and autobiographic albums compiled by the English clergyman George Streynsham Master (1823-1900). The albums range in date from the 1850s through the 1890s, and include tipped-in albumen prints, lithographs, paintings, drawings, newspaper clippings, correspondence and hotel receipts. The museum acquired the albums in 1953 as part of the Alden Scott Boyer (1887-1953) collection. My thesis is divided into two parts, the first part describing the process and development of the finding aid, and the second comprising the finding aid itself, which is divided into ten sections: 1) The Creation of the Albums, 2) Provenance of the Collection, 3) Chronology, 4) Scope and Content of the Collection, 5) Album Inventory of Autobiographic Albums, 6) Album Inventory of Travel Albums, 7) List of Photographers and their Biographies, 8) Master's Use of Nineteenth-Century Guidebooks, 9) Bibliography of George Streynsham Master's Publishing Writings, and 10) References. The finding aid is accessible to researchers in the Menschel Library at George Eastman House.
