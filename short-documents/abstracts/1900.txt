    There has been a growing concern over apparel brands in improving their environmental impact and the social responsibility throughout their supply chains. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting has ncreased within the apparel industry as a response. This thesis presents a review of the CSR reporting on the websites of the 14 apparel brands belonging to the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. Qualitative and quantitative data are collected on all reported CSR initiatives, actions and indicators. The data are organized into the five elements that represent important aspects in developing a sustainable apparel system: product sustainability, design practice, sustainable supply-chain  management, consumer engagement, and business innovation. A cross-case analysis of the apparel brands is conducted. The key findings of the study include a lack of comparability among reported CSR indicators. In addition, a similar distribution pattern of CSR indicators across the five elements was observed. The results highlight that CSR reporting currently is not effective in providing a true reflection of an apparel brands CSR actions and initiatives. This study shows that the means for evaluating effectiveness in CSR reporting has not yet been put in place.
