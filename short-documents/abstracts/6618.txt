We hope that this report will be used as a resource for governments, corporations, foundations, and individuals who seek to engage with specific focus areas. We want to make this growing database widely available to create further effective and collaborative city building. This project comprises the State of City Building Report and the Citylinx database of non-governmental GTHA city building organizations.
