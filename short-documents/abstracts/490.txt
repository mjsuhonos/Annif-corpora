    In a multi-hop network, the connection between an arbitrary source and destination node can be established using intermediate nodes. This project discusses the existing power aware routing algorithms, MHC, MTPR, and MBCR, which are used to minimize the delay, power and nodal over-utilization. The project also presents two newly proposed algorithms, MWBCR and MTP-WBCR which are simulated in a tool based on Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, to evaluate the performance using Java programming language.
