Serendipity, or serendipitous behaviour, is described as the aptitude for perceiving pleasant discoveries on an accidental basis. While not an incredibly new concept to design and its related process, serendipitous discovery within the perceptual process of design is an incredibly potent catalyst for the concepts being explored within this thesis.                                         As an introspective exercise, observing this serendipitous behaviour allows us to take a step back and apprehend new discoveries as we wade through the many aliases induced through simulated perception.
