Restorative justice is meant to be an alternative to retributive justice by putting the
process and outcome of justice back in the hands of those involved in a crime. Through narrative
inquiry, this study posed the question, “how does restorative justice impact youth in conflict with
the law?” Anti-oppressive perspectives and critical and post-modern theories were used to
analyze the narratives of participants and provide insight into the potential of restorative justice
as an empowering alternative to retributive justice. Youth found the process beneficial in a
number of ways. However, youth still experienced criminalization before participating in a
restorative justice program, suggesting that the model is unable to completely minimize the
marginalizing impacts of retributive justice. Furthermore, participants’ narratives demonstrated
the need for the restorative justice model to incorporate a critical analysis of intersectionality into
its program delivery to avoid mirroring the oppressive relations of the mainstream system.
