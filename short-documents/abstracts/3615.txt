This brief commentary is in response to the article titled: Engaging clinicians in research: Issues to consider (Dunning, 2013). The article presented an overview of nursing research that
included the various definitions of nursing research, a synopsis of the paradigms associated with nursing research, and a brief presentation of how nurses can engage in research.
Engaging in research is more than just producing evidence. It involves the active seeking out, critiquing, and application of research in the clinical setting. Many clinicians do not have the skills to be able to adequately read or interpret empirical evidence. I would argue that before a clinician can consider designing and implementing a study, they should have a solid understanding of the relationships between research and knowledge and theory and practice.
