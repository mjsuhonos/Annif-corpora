The Anthropocene, a name proposed for our current geologic age, is a phrase that describes how universal conditions on earth are changing by human impact- faster than geological occurrences. The shape of our landscapes, the composition of our soils and bodies of water, and even atmospheric particles are impacted by human activities. We see the dominating mindset most evidently in our urban environments, as the efficiency of roadways guide the shape of the landscape, and the forces of economics shape our skyline. Unlike a biological organism that emerges from the flux and flow of available materials and nutrients, we permanently affix ourselves on the earth and take beyond our resource share. This thesis explores how architecture can respond to the needs of density by reconceptualizing our practical and temporal relationship to nature through embracing the fundamentals of ecological principles, formulating a framework for the built environment in post-industrial landscapes.
