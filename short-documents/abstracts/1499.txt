    This applied thesis project demonstrates a methodology for a conservation survey of photographic albums and photographically illustrated books applied to the Photograph Collection of the National Gallery of Canada, in Ottawa, Ontario. The conservation survey captures basic descriptive and condition information and employs a priority classification system for treatment and housing recommendations for roughly one hundred and twenty bound structures in which there are mounted or inserted photographic prints. While the needs and requirements of conservation surveys are dependant on the history, scope and nature of individual collections, this thesis attempts to provide an example, or baseline, for the development of conservation surveys for similar collections or collections with similar needs. Additionally, this thesis presents a visual glossary that illustrates and serves as a reference for the identification of the leaf and binding structures of photographic albums and photographically illustrated books occurring most frequently in museum collections.
