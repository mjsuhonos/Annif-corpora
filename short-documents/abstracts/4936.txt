Vibrotactile stimulation can be used as a substitute for audio or visual stimulation for people who are deaf or blind. In order to do this, new tools must be developed and evaluated that support the creation and experience of vibration on the skin.
In this paper, a vibrotactile composition tool, the “Beadbox”, along with the results of a user study will be described. Beadbox is a vibrotactile notation system and software tool, which helps users to create and record a vibrotactile art composition. It allows users to control the four essential vibrotactile technical elements: (1) frequency; (2) intensity; (3) temporal information; and (4) spatial information consists of how the vibrotactile signal is distributed on the human body. A user study designed to evaluate the usability and support for creative expression of Beadbox. Results from the user study indicate that the Beadbox is easy to use, and viable for vibrotactile composition.
