The inertial energy of generators in a power system plays an essential role in maintaining the transient stability in response to the strike of short-circuit faults. Integration of large quantities of renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar energy, and the reduction in the number of conventional generators can lead to the reduction of the overall system inertia of the power system and may result in their vulnerability to faults.
To enable a higher integration of renewable energy and to ensure a reliable operation of the power system, it is imperative that the impact of transient stability criteria be incorporated into Unit Commitment algorithms.
This thesis proposes to incorporate an inertia based transient stability constraint in a unit commitment formulation. Algorithm to estimate parameters for the proposed transient stability constraint is developed and presented. A transient stability constrained unit commitment (TSUC) is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. The effectiveness of proposed method is successfully tested on a 9-bus power system and results are discussed
