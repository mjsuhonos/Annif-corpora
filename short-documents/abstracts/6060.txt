Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LlNC) provides basic language instruction to adult newcomers in both official languages and facilitates the settlement and integration of immigrants and refugees into Canadian society. This study examined service provider organizations and the delivery of English language learning and assessment, and provides suggestions for improvements. LlNC experiences are helpful as initial orientation to Canada and for learning English, but the program is limited in scope. Not only does the program delivery in terms of class times, schedules and availability, have limitations but assessment procedures, eligibility and teacher training are also in need of improvement This critical examination provides ideas to guide LINC language learning delivery, assessment and efficiency in the future. It also makes use ofintersectionality theory as a major avenue toward improvements.
