    Since the industrial revolution, architecture has become increasingly disconnected from its surrounding environment and the existence of regional vernacular architecture is dwindling. (Fathy, 1986; Ozkan, 1985) Modern technology coupled with globalization has resulted in universal architecture based on formal aesthetic and economy rather than local climatic factors. (Fathy, 1986; Frampton, 1983)
    The lack of regionally responsive design is nowhere more evident than in the Canadian Arctic (Dawson, 1997) Despite its immense cultural, economic and environmental importance to Canada and the world, Arctic communities have struggled with inadequate buildings and infrastructures since the creation of permanent settlements in the 1950's. (Bone, 2008; Dawson, 1997)
    Through the synthesis of modern technology and principles learned from nature and vernacular architecture this thesis explores new possibilities for a regionally responsive architecture in the Canadian Arctic; focusing on the building skin and its relationship between both indoor and outdoor environments.
