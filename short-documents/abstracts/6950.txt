Increased soil nutrient availability, and associated increase in ecosystem productivity,
could create a negative feedback between Arctic ecosystem and the climate system, reducing the
contribution of Arctic ecosystems to future climate change. This study explores the
environmental controls over spatial patterns of soil nitrogen availability in a High Arctic wet
sedge meadow and how they influence carbon exchange processes to predict whether this
feedback will develop. Ion exchange resin membranes measured available inorganic nitrogen
throughout the growing season at a high spatial resolution, while environmental variables and
carbon flux measurements were taken at frequent intervals during the 2016 field season.
Environmental measures correlated highly with total and late season nitrate with soil
temperatures having the greatest effect. The results suggest that finer scale processes altering
nitrogen availability may influence the C balance of wet sedge meadows in the High Arctic and
how these ecosystems may respond to changes in climate.
