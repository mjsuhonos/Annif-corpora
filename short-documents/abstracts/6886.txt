Recently, many methods and algorithms have been proposed in pre-fetching area. However, pre-fetching integrated with workload scheduling approaches have not been investigated as much. Initially, this thesis reviews the principles of the existing pre-fetching strategies considering latency and cost factor as primary objectives. Later, it focuses on an integrated workload scheduling and pre-fetching model to enhance the performance of response time and minimize the cost. Furthermore, response time and cost problems are formulated and to overcome the total response time and cost problems a heuristic approach is proposed. Integrated model is tested for wide range of variables and, the effects of various parameters such as processing speed and pre-fetcherâ€™s utilization are analysed and compared. Finally, based on the results integrated pre-fetching and workload scheduling model outperforms either of them, individually. Thus, this thesis can contribute to the the new solutions in this area.
