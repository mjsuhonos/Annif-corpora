Based on the minority stress model, this study examines the impact of general and gay-specific childhood teasing on adult high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men, mediated by depression and social anxiety. High-risk sexual behaviour was operationalized as the number of acts of unprotected anal intercourse with a partner of opposite or unknown HIV status, and also as the number of partners of opposite or unknown HIV status with whom an individual engaged in unprotected anal intercourse. Depression, social anxiety, and retrospective self-report of childhood teasing were measured at baseline, and sexual behaviour was measured at 6-month follow-up. Results indicate that gay-specific teasing, but not general teasing, was indirectly associated with number of high-risk sex acts via depression. Additionally, both types of teasing were directly associated with number of high-risk sex partners after accounting for depression and social anxiety.
