This is an applied project wherein 86 films by independent filmmaker Roberto Ariganello were catalogued at Canadian Filmmaker Distribution Center (CFMDC) from January-June 2018.                                                                                
Ariganello is acknowledged as one of the most vital cultural workers when it comes to his devotion to the independent film and art industries, and as a grouping of orphan films, this collection of Ariganello’s has been ignored for a long period of time.                                                                                        The outcome is an inventory for a box containing Roberto Ariganello’s collection, which is stored at CFMDC. There are two chapters: the first is a biography, and study of the status and achievement of Ariganello as an independent filmmaker, as well as a brief history of different gauges of film. The second chapter offers a reflection on the process of cataloguing, a critical analysis of the collection, and preservation  recommendations.
