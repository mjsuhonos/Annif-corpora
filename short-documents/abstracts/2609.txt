This research focuses on the waste and environmental damage caused by mining activities and the impact that this has on settlement pattern of adjacent areas. This research identifies that mining cities are unique in their land use dynamics due to the physical attributes of mining sites and there impacts on human and nature. Using a method of three sequential approaches to understand the land use dynamics of mining cities the first study examines the physical attributes of mining sites, through the creation of a new data set that combines existing and abandoned sites from existing separate datasets, outlining production, proximity to settlement areas and water bodies to identify their degree of threat to human and nature. Secondly, a single case study of Copper Cliff, ON is used to investigate how mining activities and its changes interact with surrounding land uses through a Land mosaic-function-land change feedback model adapted from Richard T.T. Formanâ€™s theory of land mosaic. The analysis then investigates the policy responses that are enacted to mitigate the mining activities with other land uses. The analysis identifies that the potential impact of mining activities is more prominent where mining waste production is higher and located at close proximity to settlement areas. However, although the growth pattern of settlement areas are often guided by the physical characteristics of mining sites, effective response of land use policies may stimulate positive changes of land use pattern.
