A combined finite element-Ritz method is developed to effectively model the 3D lowfrequency acoustics in CANDU fuel sub-channels. The complex acoustic behavior of CANDU fuel sub-channels in the cross section is captured using the six-node isoparametric triangular elements; and the acoustic wave propagation in the axial direction is modeled using the polynomials of order n. The Lagrange equations are utilized to formulate the system equations of motion. The acoustic system considered in this study consists of pipe-like medium (water) with rigid and smooth walls. At the inlet of the fuel channel acoustic system, an acoustic pressure wave is prescribed to simulate the pulsation induced by the main feeder pumps. At the outlet, the acoustic system is assumed to interact with a reacting and absorbing material with prescribed acoustic impedance. The method was tested for several scenarios of interest. Numerical results obtained are in excellent agreement with the analytical and ANSYS solutions.
