With increased demand for higher density development a key challenge for local governments is determining how to accommodate this growth while also addressing the pressure it places on local amenities and services. Density Benefit Incentives (DBIs) are a category of policy tools which address this issue by encouraging developers to provide much needed community benefits in exchange for increased density permissions. Due to flexible legislation pertaining to their use, however, the form and function of DBIs in practice can vary significantly.
In order to understand the impacts of these policy tools this study investigates the use of three archetypical DBI frameworks commonly employed by municipalities within the Metro Vancouver region. A review of literature and policy in conjunction with case study analysis of three municipalities in the region identifies best practices for DBI implementation based on local context. The report culminates in a list of recommendations for local governments looking to implement their own DBI policy.
