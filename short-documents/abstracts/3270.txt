A 3-D nanostructure particle network of TiO2, TiO, Ti3O oxide nanoparticles is synthesized by ultra-short pulsed femtosecond laser irradiation from a Grade 2 pure titanium substrate. This study investigated the properties of the resulting nanostructure and underneath phase transformed surface for biomaterial applications. Controlled tuning of surface chemistry and phases of the 3-D network were found to directly influence the cell mobility. The presented findings support a previously unrealized capacity by nano-core shell like particles and its phases for reducing cell proliferation on a biomaterial. Both osteoblast and fibroblast cells improved controllability and anisotropic migration with the developed nanostructure. The corresponding oxide phases which influenced this controllability was analysed in detail with possible potential in health care industry. The results suggest an effective means to improve biomaterial life thereby increasing implant life.
