    Content delivery over Internet is optimized for low use perceived latency by designing specialized Content Distribution Network (CDN). Content servers are connected through a content switch the distributes client requests among them to achieve load balancing across the servers. The content switch is located one-hop away from the servers. Server load balancing is one factor in achieveing low user perceived latency and improving operational efficiency. Traffic engineering is another factor that is generally and integrated with serverload balancing for CDN optimization. In this thesis we propose a request routing algorithm for a CDN that was designed to integrate server selection and traffic engineering functions in the request routing system. The CDN employs MPLS in the network for traffic engineering. The proposed algorithm optimizes content delivery for user perceived latency by achieving server load balancing and network traffic loan manaement among alternative paths. It also improves operational efficiency of the CDN by eliminating bottleneck paths and increasing utilization of underutilized servers and paths.
