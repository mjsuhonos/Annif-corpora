The title material crystallises in the triclinic crystal system in space group P-1 with Z = 2. The unit cell dimensions are a = 8.7365(6)Å, b = 10.6009(7)Å, c = 12.0210(8)Å with α = 66.343(1)°, β = 79.566(1)°, γ = 83.150(1)° and V = 1001.6(1)Å3. The final R value is 0.0307 (3905 observed reflections: I >2σ(I)). The compound is best described as a species in which each metal atom is coordinated to two dithiocarbamato groups, one of which forms a secondary bridging interaction (through a S-atom) to a second [Zn(S2CNEtPh)2] unit. Thus, the title material is in the form of a dimeric aggregate. This complex is compared to related materials which contain N-atoms within the dithiocarbamato ligand that are derived from secondary amines containing two different organic functionalities.
