Mobility, safety performance and environmental sustainability are priorities in the geometric design of roundabouts. This thesis presents a multi-objective optimization methodology for the geometric design of single-lane roundabouts. Mobility is defined in terms of roundabout delay and modeled using the (UK) empirical model. The collision frequency represents the safety objective, and modeled using the methodology outlined in the Highway Safety Manual. Environmental sustainability is represented by NOX, HC, CO2, and CO vehicle emissions and is modeled using the vehicle specific power (VSP) methodology. The presented model directly identifies the optimal geometric parameters of roundabouts. Traffic data, site conditions, and guidelines limitations were used as input data while the output decision values that minimize delay, collisions, and vehicle emissions are the optimal geometric parameters. The practical application of the proposed model is illustrated using an application example. The model was validated using an actual location, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted.
