In the midwifery and obstetrics, accurate diagnosis of labour progression is critical to ensure maternal and fetal wellbeing. In light of this, simulation systems have been designed to train practitioners. However, existing simulators lack a dynamic cervix to simulate the varying compliance of cervical ripening. In this thesis, characteristics of ex vivo human cervical tissue were studied and a pneumatically controlled compliant cervix phantom was designed. Cervical tissue exhibited strain of 0.50 for an applied stress of 325 kPa. The phantom demonstrated 35% effacement, 1 cm dilation and was capable of becoming 22 times softer. At maximum vacuum pressure, strain of 0.23 was achieved for an externally applied stress of 419 kPa. At atmospheric pressure, strain of 0.50 was achieved for an applied stress of 117 kPa. Results yield a deeper understanding of cervix characteristics and establishes the groundwork for the design of a dynamic human birth simulation training system.
