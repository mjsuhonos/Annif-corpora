    Exploring the influence of sound on architectural form and the aural quality of spaces it can create. Although people have been trying to understand the connection between music, sound and architecture for thousands of years, the role of acoustics continues to play a fairly secondary role in the process of design of architectural projects. It has been mostly relegated to a band-aid condition that is applied after the building has already been designed, or worse, left to chance. This research and design thesis will examine potential relationships between sound and architecture and explores the ways sound can be a source for the generation of spatial forms and the aural quality of spaces they can create. The approach to this thesis will be to see how sound influences architecture in three basic conditions. They are: Environmental acoustic design, program/experiential consideration and formal exploration.
