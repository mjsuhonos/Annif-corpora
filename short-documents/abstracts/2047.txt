    This study will examine the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking (2012) which represents Canada's response and commitment to combating trafficking. The goal of this study is to explore if the governmentâ€Ÿs conceptualization of victims in the action plan is representative of current trafficking trends as outlined in the Threat Assessment report of the RCMP and scholars. Research findings reveal that the gendered constructions of trafficked victims by the government as foreign vulnerable women may be representative of an ideal subject which generates public attention. This representation of victims however may not depict true characteristics as contrasting findings were found in other documents and articles. Research findings reveal that careful consideration is required when conceptualizing subjects as it sequentially impacts the development of government strategies and policies.
