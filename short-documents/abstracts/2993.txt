Rapid social and technological change have largely influenced the way in which individuals and families inhabit their dwellings, leading to new functional and formal lifestyle demands within the domestic realm.

                          “The current information society is more closely linked
                          to time than space. Its networks produce systems that
                          are discontinuous in space but continuous in time…the
                          most consistent systems are those capable of distributing
                          their activities homogeneously in time, thus avoiding the
                          generation of another parallel space…specifically for one
                          concrete use.” (Guallart, 2004, p.25)

In a time where change and transformation are omnipresent and highly influential, how can we design habitats that respond directly to the changing social order, by transforming into the appropriate space which supports the changing occupants, activities, and functions of a home?

This thesis proposes a flexible housing typology, which has the ability to transform and adapt to socio-cultural and technological changes over time.
