    The specific goal of this project is to model the energy performance of a medical office building in Carrier HAP and NRCan EE4 simulation software in order to qualify for LEED Canada energy and atmosphere perquisite 2 and credit 1. LEED Canada requires that to be eligible for EAp2 and EAc1, the proposed building must be 25% more energy efficient than a reference building which is designed according to Model National Energy Code for Buildings (MNECB). The demise of EE4 has created a demanding need to look for substitute software. One of the tasks of the project is to analyze HAP for EAp2 and EAc1 compliance process. EE4 generates the MNECB reference building itself but in HAP the reference building has to be modelled manually. The results from HAP and EE4 show that energy savings are 39.10% and 38.31% respectively with respect to MNECB reference building.
