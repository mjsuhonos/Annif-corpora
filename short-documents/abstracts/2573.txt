An increased awareness of the existing urban fabric has led to a return of interest of the built environment in architecture. Can architecture emerge from within built buildings at different moments after construction, or does architecture occur only within the design of new buildings, as commonly assumed? This thesis examines the theories in adapting existing urban fabric as a key urbanistic strategy: to enrich cities with a layering characteristic of time. It encourages a perception of the latent architectural potential within built buildings, that architecture is a temporal state rather than a finished artefact. Most importantly, it fosters an experiment of the counterpoint of different interventions with the layers of the existing building to sensitively establish a new form of architecture. An abandoned Generating Station in Toronto is used as a testing ground to demonstrate how to re-think architecture as emerging from within built buildings at different moments of time.
