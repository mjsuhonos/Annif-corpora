This research paper focuses on the phenomenon of mixed use neighbourhoods, specifically in the case of the King-Spadina neighbourhood located in the City of Toronto. This paper will examine the benefits of mixed use neighbourhoods and the issues that arise when two or more incompatible land uses are located within a given geographical area. The focus of this paper is on the case study area of the King-Spadina neighbourhood which is home to the [sic] Canada’s largest Entertainment District, an area which previously served as one of Toronto’s industrial cores. Since the elimination of traditional land use restrictions in the area the King-Spadina neighbourhood has seen an influx of redevelopment in both residential and commercial.

This paper seeks to address the current conflicts associated with having a concentration of entertainment facilities located within a community with a residential population. Through a rigorous research process, this paper aims to address how enhancing the public realm can create a more enjoyable mixed use neighbourhood.
