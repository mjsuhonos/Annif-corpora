    Traffic accidents cause a huge loss to the society. According to statistics, 50% of all accidents occur at urban intersections and 47% of these are due to left-turn collisions. Countermeasure Implementation at these locations therefore can play a vital role in the improvement of traffic safety.
    This study illustrates a methodology for evaluation of urban 4-legged signalized intersections treated with left-turn priority phasing. The methodology is applied to three important collisions types: those due to left-turn collisions; those due to left-turn side impact collisions; and all impact types combined collisions. Data used in this analysis were obtained from the City of Toronto. Safety Performance Functions for left-turn and all impact types combined collisions which were developed by the City of Toronto, were calibrated and used in an empirical Bayesian methodology that was employed to estimate the expected frequency of accidents occurring at each intersection in order to evaluate the effectiveness of left-turn priority phasing in reducing this frequency.
    The results revealed that left-turn priority phasing can be an effective treatment for addressing and reducing the number of collision at signalized intersections. Flashing advance green phasing is more effective in improving safety for two of three types; all left-turn and all impact types combined collisions. Left-turn green arrow (protected/permissive) phasing is more effective for left-turn side impact collisions. By implementing this type of treatment, the number of crashes and the associated monetary loss to society could be significantly reduced.
