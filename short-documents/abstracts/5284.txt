This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities of developing standards for biomimetic materials, based on the authors experience with International Organization for Standardization  (ISO)/Technical Committee 266 Biomimetics. With the expansion of global trade, international  standards are increasingly called on to protect the interests of consumers, improve business productivity and facilitate trade. In the past, standards typically addressed form/fit/function  specifications  and  were  associated  with  mature  industries. Recently some ISO standards are focusing on processes, quality and consistency, which can support advances in emerging fields. ISO has the potential to  advance biomimetic materials and biomimetics in general by developing and  promoting frameworks that reflect the evolving nature of biomimetics.
