A family of multichromic dyes with excellent light-harvesting abilities have been designed. They utilize redox robust triphenylamines tuned with thienyl-moeities. To confirm their performance as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells, devices are en-route for fabrication and optimization with varying electrolytes. They serve as excellent candidates towards integration with a hole-transport material: forthcoming goals will involve alteration of the dyes to allow in-situ photo-electrical polymerization with poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene. Solid state analogues of the devices present the ability to be manufactured through a direct-write process.
