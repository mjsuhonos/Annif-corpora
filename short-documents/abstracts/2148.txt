    The following thesis is an investigation on adopting Power Line Communication (PLC) technology from AC (Alternating Current) lines to DC (Direct Current) lines and possibility to apply it on automotive applications. Prototype modules are built with existing PLC chip to verify communication performance over the battery DC lines. In order to ensure reliable data transmission over the vehicle DC power lines, research is expanded to analyze the characteristics of vehicle DC-bus network. Typical automotive components are selected and tested for interference and noise analysis. Detailed studies on impulsive noise and its statistic distribution are presented. As well, the characteristics of Lead-acid battery are reviewed on the possible impacts to carrier frequency.
    Overall, PLC technology is promising for automotive applications. But the test result shows there is limitation to apply existing PLC product to automotive DC applications. Directly adopting the control method used in AC application to DC is not trivial. Further study and future research areas are recommended to be conducted to mature the PLC technology being utilized on automotive systems.
