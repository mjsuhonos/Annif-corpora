    Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality that uses near infrared light interferometry for non-invasive, near-histological resolution imaging at the micron level. Concepts from dynamic light scattering (DLS) can be adapted to OCT to detect and measure the motions in the target tissue. Tissue dynamics can be observed by measuring the speckle decorrelation time (DT) of the tissue. DT analysis was performed in a preclinical study to demonstrate the repeatability and feasibility of using DLS-OCT to observe mouse tumours undergoing cisplatin treatment over a 48-hour period. Differences in the average DT data were observed for control and cisplatin-injected mice. Image segmentation based on DT values was also performed to subtract the DT contributions of pixels at blood vessel locations, resulting in the improvement of average DT calculations of the tumour tissue. The results presented are a preliminary step to analyzing and monitoring tumour growth and treatment response in vivo.
