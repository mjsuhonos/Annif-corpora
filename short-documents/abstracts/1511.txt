    This thesis describes the design and development of Ryerson University's femtosatellite. The motiviation for this project is to achieve a new level of miniaturization of a satellite system to reduce costs and development time. A design is presented which demonstrates attitude control, earth contact capability and basic satellite functionality. This design weighs less than 100 grams including a 25 gram payload capacity. Earth observation and inspector satellite payloads are the proposed missions for this spacecraft. A prototype was constructed and its various subsystems functioned to their design capacities.
