This research investigated the fresh, mechanical and durability behavior of lightweight self-consolidating fiber reinforced concrete (LWSCFRC) with four different fibers (Polyethylene, Polyvinyl Alcohol, High-Density Polyethylene and Crumb Rubber). Two LWSCFRC mixtures were created for each fiber to analyze the effects of increasing fiber content on fresh state properties: slump flow and density. Mechanical and durability tests included compressive/ flexural strength, rapid chloride permeability and resistance to acid attack. The increase in fiber content decreased the workability of LWSCFRC mixtures except for crumb rubber. Flexural strength of all LWSCFRC specimens was similar compared to their control counterparts, while crumb rubber exhibited the highest compressive strength from all fiber specimens. Addition of fibers resulted in good
resistance against chloride ion penetration but compressive strength of specimens in a 5% sulfuric acid solution decreased. Overall, 1.0% Crumb Rubber performed better in fresh, mechanical and durability testing from all the fiber specimens.
