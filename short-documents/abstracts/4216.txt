CBRNe is an acronym referring to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and
explosives. When specialized response teams deal with CBRNe-related incidents, one of the
guiding principles is to avoid contact with the threat until the nature of the threat can be
determined. Our research demonstrates that we can safely create, inspect and manipulate a 3D
model of a suspected CBRNe threat within a physics-based game engine where models are
created from extremely accurate data gathered from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
sensors.

Our system is able to provide first responders the ability to visually identify key IED
components of interest and obtain relevant information directly from the simulation. The
primary goal of our research is to demonstrate that the functionality we developed can be used to
provide accurate information to its users for the purposes of training and potentially assist
CBRNe planning efforts in the future.
