The City of Toronto has had a long history with, and relationship to flooding.  The most severe flooding on record in Ontario occurred in October of 1954 when Hurricane Hazel struck the City of Toronto and surrounding areas.  This storm event initiated and helped to shape flood risk management and policy planning in the region.  Overtime the city`s approach to stormwater and wet weather flows evolved from flood control to management.  The current approach is guided by the city`s Wet Weather Flow Management Master Plan, an overarching plan to manage water flows in the city.  With the expected impacts of climate change further increasing the need to effectively manage water in Toronto, it is important to look at and understand the measures the city is taking to plan for and relieve flood risk into the future.  From analysis of existing literature and best practices in urban flood risk management, recommendations for improvements to the current master plan, policies, and management are made.
