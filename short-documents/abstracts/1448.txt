    Concrete is a porous material with different size of pores and cracks. Even the high quality concrete is a porous material which can pass the water through its cement paste. Porosity of the concrete can affect the natural performance of the concrete structure. Usually the water that comes from the environment contains the soluable contaminates which may initiate the reaction with the concrete materials and reduce the serviceability and design service life of the concrete.
    Durable structures to withstand significant deterioration can help to reduce the maintenance problem and conserves energy, money, materials and resources. The purpose of this research is to determine the major durability problem of concrete structure. The effects of critical environment deterioration such as sulfate and chloride attack was studied. Also the use of recycle and new material that might offset the destructive effects of environment attack to improve the durability or reduce the permeability was investigated.
