The need for the development of water reuse systems has never been higher due to depleting potable water sources, and the global migration of citizens to urban centers. While water reuse systems are a viable solution to these emerging problems, the implementation of them are often plagued by the increasing number and complexity of water treatment processes available. Therefore, the development of a decision support system (DSS) could aid engineers in their attempts to find solutions.

This thesis contains the methodology and development of the DSS, WTRNetDSS Online. This web-based DSS uses a simple geographic information system (GIS) interface that takes the user's input of water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) and potential reclaimed water end users and through the implementation of a multi objective genetic algorithm returns a set of optimal solutions. WTRNetDSS Online successfully determined optimal solutions for the case study of irrigation for Chicago area golf courses.
