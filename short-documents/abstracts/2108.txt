    The 2009 Tamil demonstrations in Toronto challenged the preconceptions of public space and the legitimacy of transnational politics within a ‘multicultural’ city. This paper explores the impact these demonstrations had on Toronto’s ‘public spaces’, especially how they were able to transform the city. An analysis of secondary data sources, including, media coverage and participant-observations reveal that even though the political demonstrations organised by the Sri Lankan Tamil-Canadians were ‘tolerated’, they were not necessarily ‘accepted’ by many Torontonians. This observation raises numerous interrelated questions, particularly related to the rights of immigrants and refugee groups to the city.
