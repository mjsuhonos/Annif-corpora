The musical mood induction procedure was used to induce 3 negative moods:
sadness, fatigue and anxiety. Induction was validated using subjective and physiological
measures. One hundred twenty-seven participants listened to one of 18 film soundtrack
excerpts for 20 minutes. Physiological response (heart rate, respiration, skin conductance
level (SCL), and facial electromyography) was recorded throughout the induction and
postinduction phases. Subjective mood ratings (sadness, anxiety, tiredness, valence,
arousal) were provided before induction and throughout the postinduction phase.
Repeated measures ANOVAs showed increase in valence and decrease in arousal in all
conditions after induction, which persisted in the postinduction phase, and an increase in
tiredness immediately after induction. Reduction in SCL was strongest in the fatigue
condition. However, difference between groups was only evident when comparing
fatigue and sadness conditions between 3-10 minutes. Lack of between-group differences
and mixed physiological findings suggest that specificity is difficult to achieve through
musical mood induction.
