There is a need to better understand the performance characteristics of HR VRF systems in a cold climate. This study involved the development of a HR VRF system model in EnergyPlus, using field data from a two-storey case study office building. Using the model, this study investigated calibration with site information, climate variations, VRF indoor terminal unit reconfiguration for heat recovery improvements, right-sizing HR VRF outdoor units to raise part-load ratios, and comparing the HR VRF system to other HVAC systems for system efficiency. Challenges with achieving model calibration led to recommendations for monitoring system design and EnergyPlus modelling improvements.
