There is a growing body of research on the interplay between increasingly digitally informed
political campaigning and citizen engagement in the political sphere both on and offline. While
much of the existing scholarship concerns how digital technology impacts engagement,
participation and the spread of information, there is limited research into the ways in which
specific digital content modes and social media platforms intersect in ways that can lead to
increased involvement of individuals in high-effort political activities. This research paper
focuses on the personal action framing of campaign videos created in support of the Labour
Partyâ€™s general election campaign in 2017. Videos created by both the central campaign and the
grassroots political organization Momentum were designed to be shared widely over social
media platforms to achieve visibility over a broad network of supporters and undecided voters
over the course of the campaign. By analyzing the content of these videos, I will show how
specific instances of digital media, such as videos, can invite instances of high-effort political
participation through personalized political action framing. Drawing on connective action theory,
and in particular, the discussion of personalized politics (Bennett, 2012; Bennett & Segerberg,
2013), this research uses thematic content analysis to identify which high-effort political
activities are alluded to most often in the video content. By comparing the videos produced by
Labour with those of Momentum, this contribution addresses a gap in the existing literature as it
relates to how campaigns can benefit from loosely connected ties to organizations that use digital
media to expend their networks of influence to develop their strategic capacity. The methods
explored in this research can inform future study on the use of campaign videos in political
movement building and election campaigns.
