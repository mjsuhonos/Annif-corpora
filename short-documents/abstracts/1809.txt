    This thesis evaluates the potential use of processed tear-off shingles in road works. Six types of granular materials were investigated to determine the type of material that benefitted the most from using the shingles.
    The effects of shingles on the stability, as measured by California Bearing Ratio, were found to depend on properties such as gradation and fines content. In general shingles enhanced the stability of materials of relatively low CBR, but decreased the stability of angular well graded material of CBR larger than 100%. Optimum amount of shingles were found to enhance the resistance of stabilized granular materials to cycles of freezing and thawing; however, amounts higher than optimum decreased the resistance to freezing and thawing. In terms of permeability, the addition of shingles did not have a significant effect on the drainage characteristics of the tested materials.
    A trial road was constructed and showed that after one week of construction dust generated by the control section was found to be twice the amount of dust generated by the shingle section.
