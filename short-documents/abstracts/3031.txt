With the level of difficulty a foreign trained doctor must endure to achieve doctor status in Ontario, there is an apparent flaw in the system that this paper suggests may be a result of institutional racism. The process for foreign trained doctors to undergo is examined in the context of the doctor shortage in Ontario, the assessment process, and case studies from other countries that suggest the difficulty foreign trained doctors experience may be a result of institutional racism. This paper argues that foreign trained doctors are important to physician resource planning in Ontario and there needs to be reform of the current licensing requirements to recognize their credentials.
