    Individual and Group Portraits Germany WWI is an album of postcards from the First World War that contains fifty-nine silver gelatin photographic postcards and two mechanically printed picture postcards. The album was compiled by an unidentified individual. Twenty-six of these postcards have handwritten correspondence, which are written by several authors but addressed to the same person. This thesis is an applied project that focuses on cataloguing the images in The Museum System (TMS), the George Eastman House collection database. The goal of this project is to make the album more accessible to researchers through cataloguing and digitization of the images, and translation of the correspondence. This paper provides contextual research about the First World War, photographic postcards, and German handwriting. The paper will also discuss the cataloguing methodology and includes an illustrated appendix with full catalogue records.
