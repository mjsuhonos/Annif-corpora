    In this thesis, a new concept and design is presented for a tool with the purpose of deburring gas turbine engine parts. This new concept utilizes both axial and radial active force compliance to accomplish the burr removal in a more robust manner. The axial and radial components are integrated in a manner that allows them to be decoupled, reducing the complexity of the system. The tool is designed around a pneumatic spindle that is affixed to pneumatic axial actuators. The axial motion system is then affixed to the radial system which makes use of a 2 axis rotary gimbal, acting as a 2-D pivot. Sensors for the axial and radial components of the tool are independent of each other. Axial sensing is accomplished using a commercial string-potentiometer and radial sensing is accomplished using magnets and magnetic field sensors. Burr formation and methods of removal are discussed. Different deburring tool designs available commercially and through literature are then explored. The design process of selecting axial and radial actuation and sensing and integrating them together while keeping the systems decoupled is outlined. Modeling of the tool is then developed and a simulation of the tool is presented to illustrate the deburring mechanics of the decoupled axial and radial components. Experimentation to determine the stiffness qualities of the tool as well as calibration of the sensors are presented and used within the simulation.
