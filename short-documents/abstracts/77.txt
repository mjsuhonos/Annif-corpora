    This paper gives an overview of GIS applications on the Internet starting with an introductory scenario. The technical background of Internet GIS is examined from three perspectives: the browser-centered view, the Internet-enabled GIS view, and the component view. Subsequently, a consistent terminology for the classification of Internet GIS applications, according to the services they offer, is proposed as a base for further discussion. The individual service components can be interpreted as functional modules of different application types. The paper concludes with outlines of future technical advances and possible resulting consequences for GIS experts, users and the GIS market on the way into the next millenium.
