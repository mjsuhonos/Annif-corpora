Accurate detection of white spaces is crucial in cognitive radio networks. Initial investigations show that the accurate detection in a multiple primary users environment is challenging, especially under severe multipath conditions. Among many techniques, recently proposed eigenvalue-based detectors that use random matrix theories to eliminate the need of prior knowledge of the signals proved to be a solid approach. In this work, we study the effect of Rayleigh multipath fading channels on spectrum sensing in a multiple primary user environment for a pre-proposed detector called the spherical detector using the eigenvalue approach. Simulation results show interesting outcomes.
