In this work, phase-change contrast agents were developed for photoacoustic (PA) imaging and therapy. They consist of superheated liquid perfluorocarbon and gold nanoparticles capped by a Poly-(Lactide-co-Glycolic Acid) (PLGA) polymer shell. The phase transition from liquid to gas bubble can be remotely triggered by a laser source. In their liquid state, upon laser irradiation, these agents generated strong PA signals which were proportional to the laser fluence and particle sizes. The vaporization threshold decreased with increasing particle size, and was 850, 670 and 420 mJ/cm2 for 2, 5, 10 Î¼m-sized PLGA particles loaded with 35 nm GNPs, respectively. Cell culture studies, including passive uptake by the cancer cells and mechanical damage to the cancer cells caused by the vaporization inside the cells are also investigated. These agents show potential as photoacoustic imaging contrast and cancer therapy agents for clinical applications.
