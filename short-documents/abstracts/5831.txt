Traditionally, there has been minimal interest on behalf of developers, land owners as well as private sector stakeholders to redevelop brownfields (De Sousa, 2000). The fears of real or perceived contamination have made the redevelopment project too expensive and risky to develop profitably. Limited government funding and assistance to the private sector for brownfield redevelopment further complicates brownfield redevelopment. This research investigated Ontarioâ€™s Community Improvement Plans with brownfield provisions and how they quantitatively aid investor returns. Hypothetical scenarios for a multifamily residential development were generated for both hypothetical brownfield and greenfield sites where brownfield incentives could be implemented. The pro forma analysis revealed that a full exemption from regional development charges (RDC) had the greatest effect on 
investor returns (NPV and IRR) followed by the joint TIEG offered in the City of Waterloo. Greenfield development is the most financially feasible option with no added costs or risks from contamination.
