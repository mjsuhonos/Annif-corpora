The degree that science is integrated into environmental policy processes is dependent on the policymakers' perception of the role and utilization of science in policy development. Using existing literature and interviews with key individuals in North America and Uganda engaged in environmental policy development, this thesis argues that adopting a positivist approach to policy development strengthens the science-policy interface and can result in more effective policies. This interface is examined in the context of transboundary water management, and specifically in East Africa's Lake Victoria management regime. This paper illustrates how the relationship between science and policy is evolving in a difficult ecological, socio-economic and political setting, and how the tensions that exist are attempting to be resolved. It is observed that the science-policy divergence can be exacerbated in transboundary areas. This requires scientists and policymakers to be cognizant of these challenges, and to adopt tools to strengthen the interface for the development of effective transboundary water management regimes.
