    With the rise in digital photography -- and the shift in photography's materiality -- it has become increasingly important to revisit photographs and reconsider them as multifaceted objects, and not simply as two-dimensional images. In this applied thesis project, the Art Gallery of Ontario's John Richmond Harris study collection was used as the basis for creating a presentation set of fifteen different 19th and 20th century positive photographic processes. With specially constructed archival housings and concise didactic labels accompanying each photograph, this presentation set aims to enable learning about the identification of photographic processes through the use of original examples, while encouraging the consideration of photography's material qualities, to help the user better understand photography's past social and cultural function.
