    Rising levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been ovserved in the environment, humans, and animlas. Studies have shown that these compounds can elicit toxic effects in animals (e.g. neurotoxicity and thyroid toxicity). This research investigated the effects of BDE47 on the survival and reproduction of Daphnia magna over two generations. The impacts of water-borne exposure were compared to dietary exposure using the following treatments: dosed water (DW), dosed algae (DA) and dosed water and algae (DWA). In the first generation, significant impacts on reproduction were observed in daphnids in the DA and DWA treatments. In the second generation, no significant impacts on reproduction were observed indicating a recovery from maternal exposure. When second generation daphnids were exposed to BDE47, there was high mortality in the DWA treatment anad reduced reproduction in all dosed treatments. Dietary exposure to BDE47 had a more profound impact on daphnid reproduction than water exposure. In the second generation, dietary exposure affected both survival and reproduction and water exposure reduced reproduction, indicating that maternal exposure was a factor.
