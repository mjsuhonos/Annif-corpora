    Fashion brands continue to diversify their product lines into other markets, including beauty,homegoods, interiors, and architecture. Using symbolic preference formation theory, this study analyzed several successful fashion lifestyle brands’ visuals in order to identify required elements of cohesive branding systems, starting with Paul Poiret and Jeanne Lanvin, leading up to Diane von Furstenberg (DVF), Marchesa, and Ralph Lauren. Consumers express their personal identity through apparel and home décor, and brand visuals are created to influence purchasing decisions by depicting products as fitting with a desired lifestyle. Case studies focused on how fashion brands have evolved to represent lifestyle and examined the role visuals play in defining a distinctive, cohesive identity across a constellation of products. The research utilized two types of secondary sources: printed and digital. Media such as advertisements, websites, packaging were examined in order to compare product categories, theme, motif, style and colour use in order to create guidelines for creative brand visuals.
