This research examined the relationship between fashion and art in the Arabian Gulf and sought to determine if fashion can function as art in the latter geopolitical location. In-depth interviews with study participants revealed attitudes towards the two creative industries that helped create a capsule collection consisting of 5 garments that illustrate the findings of this project and highlight the importance of value differences, regional demographics, and cultural understandings of art. The resulting collection, Binomia, reflects Durkheim’s ideas on individuals’ ability to read symbols and the difference in opinions that result from these culturally informed understandings.
