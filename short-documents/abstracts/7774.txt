Current passing sight distance requirements for two lane highways by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials are based on field studies conducted between 1938 and 1941 which use deterministic values for its design variables such as passing sight distance, speed of the passing vehicle, speed differential between the passed and passing vehicle etc. This report presents three methods to analyze reliability and serves as an extension to the revised model presented by Yasser Hassan, Said Easa and A.O.Abd El Halim whose model sought to improve older models by equally considering both observed passing behaviours of drivers and passing maneuvers that are consistent with two lane highways. Analysis of passing sight distance using first order second moment reliability method, advanced first order second moment and the ellipsoid approach to measure the probability of failure of the passing sight distance design, rely solely on the mean and variance (moments) of each randomly distributed variable in contrast to methods that rely only on deterministic values. Results show the advanced first order second moment and the ellipsoid approach provided more accurate results than first order second moment method which in turn provide a greater safety margin with the later also proving to be a much more robust and efficient method of performing a reliability
