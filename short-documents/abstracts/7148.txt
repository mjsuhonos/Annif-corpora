Using the photography collection in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH) as a primary source, this thesis explores the use of photographic rebate as found in the work of seven major twentieth century photographic artists working between 1920 and 1980. Investigating the use of rebate as both a manifestation of technology, and as an expressive tool employed by post-war photographers, this paper looks at the physical character of rebate in silver-gelatin prints and its role in augmenting the photographic image. This research elucidates the collection at MFAH, the history of photographic printing in the 20th century and provides a guide to future researchers about how rebate can be used to glean technical data and artistic intent.
