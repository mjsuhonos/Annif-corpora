The aim of this study is to analyze the feasibility of building private residential space on top of existing publicly-owned inner-suburban Toronto community centres and library buildings through a public-private partnership.

The numerous benefits and feasibility of these 'vertical expansions' to the community and government is validated by the potential ability to increase local access to services, compatibility with wider government planning objectives such as smart growth, and by the capacity to kickstart a virtuous economic cycle to increase quality of place. The appeal to private developers is demonstrated through considerations of the market, money, production, people and environment.

Pilot sites where vertical expansions could best succeed are identified based on facility type, 'city 3' suburban status, potential marketability, and basic physical & structural considerations. 16 pilot sites were identified, which were further refined based on property value to identify the pilot sites with the highest potential for success.

A model for a reductionist and mutually equitable P3 arrangement for both the development and post-construction management was proposed and informed by the literature review of past P3 case studies.
