Because very few studies that examine the case in U.S. and Canada have considered the differences in cultural/social context and the different patterns of people's perceptions of the new and emerging technologies, this paper will attempt to demonstrate two different approaches - diffusion theory and cross-cultural perspective - to the adoption and diffusion of mobile telephone and apply them into the adoption of text messaging service in Canada. In regards to the cross-cultural approach, the similarities and differences in regards to young people in both Korea and Canada will be provided as a means to address the relationship between cultural variables/obstacles and the rate of text messaging adoption in Canada"--From Introduction page 3.
