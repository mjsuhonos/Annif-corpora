This study explores the experiences of Indo-Trinidadian youth and their self-identity.  It seeks to generate an understanding of how Indo-Trinidadian youth have to negotiate their identity after migration from Trinidad to Canada.  This negotiation comes as a result of their hybrid identity - racially South Asian but culturally Caribbean.  Because school is the first space of socialization that immigrant youth encounter after family, this study focuses on issues faced in school.  Using a qualitative research design, this study examines the personal narratives of eight (four males and four females) Indo-Trinidadian youth.  The in-depth interviews with these youth bring forth the notion that Indo-Trinidadian youth are constantly reconstructing their identities as they negotiate between their Indian and Caribbean cultures.  This paper highlights the challenges, that Indo-Trinidadian youth encounter as well as the ways in which they address them, essentially leading to a sense of agency for their self identity.
