    This thesis is an applied project undertaken to provide access to a group of nearly 5,700 undescribed prints and negatives made by Everette Dixie Reese (1923-1955) preserved at George Eastman House (GEH). Reese acted as the Chief of the Photo Section for the Special Technical and Economic Mission (STEM) to Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam (CLV) from 1951 to 1955 during the Indochina War (1946-1954). The project involved writing a multilevel, archival finding aid for the materials following the Society of American Archivists' standard that includes the scope and content, research strengths, series and subseries descriptions and container lists for the materials along with an extended biography and chronology for Reese. In preparation for the eventual object-level cataloguing of the collection, five objects were selected and catalogued in The Museum System (TMS) to act as exemplification models for future cataloguers. These products are supplemented by an analytical paper outlining the methodology of the project, research required, decisions made in the process, and the steps taken to complete it.
