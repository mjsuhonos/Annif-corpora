John Walker’s Passage makes a valuable contribution to contemporary film studies, reflecting on the definitive work of one of Canada’s finest documentary filmmakers. Darrell Varga’s close analysis of Passage (2008) situates the film within John Walker’s prolific body of work and the tradition of documentary filmmaking in Canada. The book attests to the strength and significance of this powerful, provocative, and distinctly Canadian film, and thereby occupies a central place in the University of Toronto Press “Canadian Cinema” series.
