    Using the Interactive Model of Ethnic Entrepreneurship created by Waldinger et al. (1990), this major research paper examines the strategies employed by Chinese entrepreneurs in Toronto. Pacific Mall, an indoor shopping centre located in the outer skirt of Toronto, is selected as a case study of Chinese enclave economy to determine whether the model is reflective of reality. An in-depth examination of a set of internal and external factors is presented to explain how the opportunity structure interacts with the goup characterstics of the entrepreneurs to facilitate ethnic entrepreneurship in Pacific Mall. The findings of this paper indicates that the model generally presents a good explanation of the circumstances found in Pacific Mall; however, minor gaps remain as certain factors could not be explained by the model.
