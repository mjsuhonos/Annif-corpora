    This thesis proposes a model for the cataloging, evaluation, and description of photographic paper sample books in the George Eastman House collection. The model is implemented as a reference resource on Notes - on Photographs, a collaborative website in development at George Eastman House with the support of a National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Notes - on Photographs is built on a wiki platform, which is characterized by capabilities for dynamic updating and collaborative editing by a group of users. The model implemented to describe the contents of the paper sample books utilizes these capabilities to further enrich the information resource.
    Manufacturer paper sample books are invaluable resources in developing a better understanding of the materials of photography; they reveal the evolution of the dominant image-making support for over a century of silver halide photography. This project seeks to do a better job of explaining what they are, why they are valuable, and of promoting a standardized language to facilitate description and communication among professionals engaged in the care, display, and study of photographs. The ability to articulate the technological and material aspects of any medium contributes to better discernment and has implications for establishing authenticity, being conscious of an image maker's aesthetic decisions, dating works, and for understanding the condition and preservation of the object.
    In most cases photographic paper sample books in the George Eastman House collection are undated, and catalogue records treat the books as single entries rather than complex bound material where each sample has unique characteristics. The work accomplished in this thesis will inform and enrich the object information in the current cataloging system, The Museum System (TMS) at George Eastman House.
