Many academics have claimed that community policing has been unevenly applied, and that it is unable to address the needs of an ethnically diverse community.  The goal is to assess if this assertion is true with respect to Durham Region.  This study employs a document analysis of Durham Regional Police Service reports and the Government of Ontario's community policing orientation to determine whether its approach is representative of the provincial benchmark , and if it addresses ethnicized group concerns.  The result suggest that community policing has been implemented with modest success in both regards.
