This major research paper explores opportunities to support small businesses after natural disasters through the creation of temporary commercial developments. The Re:START Christchurch shipping container mall is selected as a case study for further examination into the built-form and urban design characteristics that best support recovery needs. The findings of this paper indicate that Re:START Christchurch not only does a good job of addressing the post-disaster needs of businesses, but also serves to strengthen the identity and community of the recovering city. Best practices and recommendations are extracted from this example to be considered for the Pacific Northwest and other cities recovering from future natural disasters.
