A recommendation that Vancouver City Council implement the Culture Plan’s commitment to address the persisting insufficiency of small rental performing arts venues by using Community Amenity Contributions (CACs) from the rezoning of properties to fund the creation of small, inexpensive ‘incubator’ neighbourhood performing arts venues, which are critical to the health and development of the performing arts community. The recommended development model is based on Havana Theatre; a small incubator performing arts venue located inside Havana Restaurant, which subsidizes the cost of operating the venue. In downtown, developers will build the venues and attached retail space using in-kind CACs. Outside of downtown, a ‘renovation-first’ approach will be taken by the City to buy existing buildings using accrued CACs and renovate them to create the venues and attached retail space. On the strength of experience and business plan, the City will select qualified bidders to operate the venues and attached businesses.
