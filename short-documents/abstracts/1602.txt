    Despite recent government policies aimed at attracting international students as immigrants, little research has involved this population directly. This study explores the experiences of international students in their transition to permanent resident. Data gathered from fifteen semi-structured interviews with current and former international students seek to answer: Why do international students decide to remain in Canada after graduating? What challenges do they face during this transition? What strengths do they possess and what strategies do they use to help them become permanent residents? The findings suggest differing levels of need for support services during their transition and the strong impact of individual decisions on integration success. Participants and the author make recommendations for improving the immigration process.
