    This paper argues that, despite multidisciplinary efforts, migration and tourism studies remain restricted by the paradigms to their own specialized industries: policy-relevant approaches geared towards government agencies and their fields of intervention in the case of migration studies as well as management perspectives directed to the expansion, marketing, and consumption of the travel industry in the case of tourism studies. The aim of this paper is to critique the trend of securitization in both fields of research and to hint at similarities in impact and meaning. Apart from the differentiation between consumption and production-led migration, both phenomena tourism and migration have a lot in common. Both are major driving forces of globalization and social change on the local level. By discussing recent critical literature on transnationalism, migration and tourism, this paper argues that hybrid forms of human mobility and the similar economic, environmental and social impact of tourists and migrants lead to the urgent reconfiguration of the social science paradigm through which the governance of human mobility is being studied. Ultimately, this paper wants to cross both perspectives and hint at similar issues of identity, social diversity, and sustainability.
