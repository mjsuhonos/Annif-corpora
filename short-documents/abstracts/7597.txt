The purpose of this project is to increase the measurement accuracy of the rotation angle and
measurement speed. There is one rotatable circular plane with many holes in it, the initial
location of this circular plane is stored in a CCD camera and is regarded as a stationary
circular plane. When the rotatable circular plane is rotated, the intensity of the light across
the holes of two circular planes is changed. This intensity will represent the position of the
rotatable circular plane, so the position of that plane can be measured by calculating the
intensities of light access between the two planes.

In this project, several methods are proposed to increase the accuracy of measurement.
To prevent a non- concentricity problem between two circular planes, only one circular plane
is used in this system. To reduce the dfficulties in the fabrication process, holes will be
used instead of using traditional slits. To increase the reading and calculation speed, an
FPGA will be used in this system. For improving sampling accuracy, a Kalman filter is
used. Overall, this system can reach an accuracy of 2:2176* 10-5 degree with all angles.
