    Ultra High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) is beginning to revolutionize the construction industry. The research presented discusses an experimental pro gram designed toinvestigate the mechanical and structural properties of UHPFRC. The mechanical properties focused on examining the tensile behavior by testing the fracture energy, tension stiffening and shear friction properties of UHPFRC. The structural properties focused on investigating behaviors such as; flexure and shear. The tensile behavior proved to be significantly improved by the use of fibers. Results show an ultimate tensile strength twice the cracking tensile strength. The shear friction was also enhanced due to the fiber reinforcement. Improved design equation, with great accuracy when compared to experimental results are proposed. The addition of fibers, significantly improved the shear and flexure behavior of reinforced  beams. The influence of the fiber reinforcement was of very significant;  promoting flexural failure in reinforced beams rather than the shear failure when compared to normal and high strength concrete.
