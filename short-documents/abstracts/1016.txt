    This thesis presents the methodology developed to identify the most cost-effective specifications that could be applied to the currently practiced new housing constructions in Canada to achieve improved energy efficiency standards, while maintaining an adequate level of thermal comfort.
    The results showed that, based on the life cycle cost analysis of 30 years, the optimal solutions (or upgrades) comprised of improvement in the thermal resistance of the building envelope, and installation of the most efficient heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems, resulting in up to 31% reductions in the estimated annual energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions, while achieving an EnerGuide Rating of 8, thereby meeting the new requirements of the upcoming 2012 Ontario Building Code. With the installation of a residential photovoltaic system, the estimated profit of up to $89,035 could be achieved through Ontario's micro Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) program, allowing a homeowner to pay for the implementation of additional upgrade(s).
