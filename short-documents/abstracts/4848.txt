This paper aims moves [sic] away from a simplistic cultural interpretation of violence and utilizes an intersectional perspective for understanding multiple oppressions faced by abused South Asian women.  Mapping key intersecting issues and analysis of gaps in the service provision in the domestic violence sector are undertaken through an in-depth literature review.  An exploratory and descriptive case study method is adopted to explore a community-based organization's approach to culturally appropriate domestic violence intervention in the South Asian community.  Case study findings recommend utilizing a culturally appropriate approach for understanding, engaging and intervening in domestic violence cases in the South Asian community.  Community development, strengthening the family and a non-blame approach to addressing violence is recommended through the case study.
