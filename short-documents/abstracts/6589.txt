Inclusion literature is multifaceted; demonstrated by variation in meaning and interpretation of the concept. Within the body of literature on inclusion, educators' perceive training and support needs as key barriers to practicing inclusive education. The current study explores the perceptions of twenty early childhood educators across Toronto, Ontario about their own training and support needs for enacting inclusive education. A qualitative interview method, and triangulation with two questionnaires were used to collect data. The social model of disability was the theoretical framework that guided the research project. Major themes came from the topics identified in the literature and elicited through interview questions. Several subthemes also emerged during data analysis. Results of the thematic analysis suggest that opportunities for ongoing training and more access to resources are sought by educators and might increase confidence in their ability to include children with disabilities in their programs. Recommendations for future research and practice are discussed.
