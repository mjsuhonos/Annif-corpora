The need for having a mechanism to automatically interpret content available on the Web without a human intervention has lead to the development of a new vision for the next generation of the Web, known as the Semantic Web.  This new paradigm advocates the use of ontologies to achieve a common language for communication among humans, computers, and programs.  In this thesis, a novel Semantic Web-based solution called SCOW-Q (Semantic Capability Discovery With QoS) model, is proposed, which provides an architectural basis for representing trust and trust management in Opportunistic Networks.  The model is validated by means of a Use Case Scenario using a well-defined Semantic Web Service framework.
