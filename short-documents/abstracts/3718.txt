With the growing environmental, health and economic concerns associated with automobiles, municipalities are investing in cycling infrastructure. These new infrastructures are often assumed to facilitate a mode substitution effect, encouraging users to switch to active transportation. This study explores the impact of cycle tracks on travel behavior. A case study was conducted on Sherbourne Street, in the city of Toronto, that was redeveloped in 2012 to include cycle tracks, i.e., separated bicycle lanes. The study used a street intercept survey method to record quantitative data on retrospective cycling travel behavior. A mode substitution was observed, with 37.85% of the sample being new riders. However, this number was possibly influenced by self-selection, or a change in residency or destinations. The main reasons for switching to cycling along Sherbourne Street were listed as improved safety and efficiency. The case study provides a measure of the impact of cycle tracks, providing a justification for this infrastructure design.
