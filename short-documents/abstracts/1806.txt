    Launched in 2004, Flickr.com is among the most popular photo-sharing websites on the planet.  A mix of social networking and traditional album creation, Flickr is ideally suited to some of the key functions of family photography - sharing stories and memories, and maintaining social relations.  This paper draws links between traditional album creation and social networking, while serving to document actual patterns of use and organizational abilities presented in Flickr in very simplistic ways, 'dumping' their photos online in a way that is reminiscent of how people used to dump printed photos into shoeboxes.  A very different group more often found within Pro use accounts, took full advantage of the organizational structures presented in the website, creating complex webs of interconnected sets, tags and groups, while involving themselves in group photo pools and other social aspects of the site.
