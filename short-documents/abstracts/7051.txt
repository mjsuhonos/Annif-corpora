development efforts, we can look to better Improve and Assist the growth of a marginalized community, adding an ideological layer, worthy of a communication system, that enables a sense of community and empowerment, initiates upward mobility for future generations in addition to improving quality of life. The matrix would be adaptive to any circumstance or region, as it will act as a matrix in which the communication approaches and interventions are determined based on specific indicators. The goal is to be adapted into various development efforts and produce
