Cycling rates in many North American cities decline significantly in winter months, which is a major challenge for practitioners and advocates in advancing active transportation-related policy, planning, and programs. This research investigates Ryerson University as a major commute destination. By combining a student and employee transportation survey, this research examines characteristics associated with winter cycling. Our results indicate that women (OR=0.38) and transit pass holders (OR=.12) were less likely while students rather than staff (OR=1.69) were more likely to cycle during the winter. The density of dedicated bicycle facilities within 500m of the shortest route was positively associated with all-season cycling (OR = 1.57). Also, a cyclist living in a more stable neighbourhood was more likely to bicycle through winter (OR=4.33), when compared to cycling only in warmer seasons. These findings will be useful to city planners considering how to encourage winter cycling to urban university campuses and/or major downtown employment centres.
