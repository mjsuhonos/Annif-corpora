This thesis intends to contextualize the Edward S. Curtis (1868-1952) material at the Art Gallery of Ontario into a resource document containing cataloguing and background information. The fully illustrated essay and document provide details of Curtis’s life’s work, The North American Indian (1907-1930). The thesis is divided into two parts: a research paper and a resource document. The first part is a research paper describing Curtis’s project and the literature surrounding it and culminating in a description of the sixty-eight pieces in the AGO collection. The second part is an illustrated resource document that catalogues one object per page and includes an extended note for each object. The AGO collection of Curtis material consists of sixty-five photogravures, one cyanotype, one postcard, and one film.
