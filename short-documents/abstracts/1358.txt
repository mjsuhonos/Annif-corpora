    This action research thesis aimed to: 1) develop and test a viable Discrete Event Simulation and Human Factors Modeling approach for an Ontario based telecommunication company, and 2) identify the factors that affect the uptake and application of the approach in work system design. This approach, which was validated at the Company, incorporated fatigue dose and learning curves in a Discrete Event Simulation model. The barriers to uptake included: Time constraints, lack of technological knowledge and initial cost. The uptake facilitators were: High frequency products produced, clear value added to leadership, defects reduction and the Company being open to new technology. In addition to helping design a manual assembly line with fewer bottlenecks and reduce the human factors risks for the employee, the developed approach showed a 26% correlation with quality defects. Further research is recommended to identify additional human factors and their benefits.
