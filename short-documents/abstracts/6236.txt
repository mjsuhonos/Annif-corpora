Research has identified many benefits of participating in team sports. These examinations have discovered that girls are less likely to participate in team sports than boys. This study examines the reasons why girls do or do not participate in team sports. In this qualitative study, girls aged 6 to 9 were interviewed about their experiences that have either led them to participate in team sports or not participate in team sports. Through this study it was discovered that the family and peer group play a major role in influencing team sports participation in young girls. I found that the interviewed girls believe that boys are more successful in team sports, that sports skills are gendered and there are many ways to improve team sports participation for other young girls. Through the identification of factors which encourage or discourage participation in team sports, practitioners will be better informed on how they may support girls in participating in team sports.
