    Conversion of cellulose to glucose units by cellulases, called hydrolysis, is a very complex step in ethanol production. It requires the mixing of aqueous suspensions of cellulose/cellulases so that cellulases (majority composed of the active site domain and the binding site domain) can attach to cellulose chains, cut or hydrolyze ÃŸ(1-4) glycosidic bonds between glucose units, de-attach and move to another location. Mixing extent (insufficient or excessive agitation) might influence the attachment of cellulases and possibly lead to lower glucose yields. A long-term goal of this research is to determine the strength of mixing required to be applied during the cellulose-cellulase mixing cycle. For that purpose, one of the objectives was to purify CBH I exocellulase from the commercial cellulase mixture. A partial purification of the CBH I that was performed on a much smaller scale with uncontrolled flow rate was successful. Another objective was to propose a scheme that would covalently immobilize CBH I exoceullase via its active site domain (ASD) on an atomic force microscopy-compatible support, a silicon support. A theoretically-developed hypothetical scheme was constructed (with the provided detailed procedure). The approach of immobilizing the inhibitor specific to the ASD of CBH I enzyme led to the possibility that no purification of CBH I could be required. Skipping CBH I purification step would save time and hassle associated with purification step. Once the ASD of CBH I is immobilized on a silicon support, the AFM force profile between the free-floating CDB and substrate cellulose could be established.
