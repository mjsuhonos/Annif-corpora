    The following report outlines the conjectural basis for an examination of the existing system of architectural production, and the imminent changes that are becoming more evident with the increasing saturation of digital technologies.
    Emergence and complexity theory have set the stage for a future of integrated system design. With many of our current modes of production already being heavily influenced by digital design and automated fabrication, the question for the building industry becomes not if, but how shall these systems be integrated in the production of architecture?
    Through the execution of an urban design project located at the Alexandra Park housing co-operative, this thesis establishes a commentary based in emergent theory that grounds the speculation of future possibilities in an historical understanding of current changes in contemporary architectural discourse. The exploration of difference as a generator of urban renewal is central to the proposals ability to induce positive change through dynamic emergent behavior.
