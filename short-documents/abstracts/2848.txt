This research examines the aging population and explores how the urban built environment should be transformed to be friendlier to seniors. Rapidly approaching, an unprecedented shift in demographics will significantly increase the proportion of the seniorsâ€™ population. Their changing needs and capabilities will pose accessibility issues within the built environment. A case study of the waterfront neighbourhood of Port Credit in Mississauga, Ontario will be used, as an example of a local aging population. By studying policy documents, a recent mixed-use development, site visits, and interviewing key informants, it was found that dense, compact and transit-oriented developments (TODs) that are walkable, allow seniors to age- in-place better, compared to the traditional neighbourhood design. In Summary, this research reveals that by making the urban built environment more walkable, and accessible, seniors can be more independent, safer and better be integrated into the community for a longer time.
