    In a response to the effects of sprawl and the growth pressures that face the City of Toronto and the rest of the Province of Ontario, Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) can be implemented as a smart growth tool that can provide a meaningful sustainable alternative to conventional development practices. This research paper explores TOD in all of its capacities, context, design principles and the benefits and barriers that encourage or inhibit its execution. With a lack of effective performance measures in the current literature, this report aims to respond to the question: Can LEED-ND assist in addressing the main goals, objectives and barriers of TOD? LEED-ND is a rating system that shares the same smartgrowth and new urbanist concepts as TOD. The various categories of the LEED-ND system help to analyze TODs by more than just design elements and instead help to put focus on the sustainable and social objectives.
