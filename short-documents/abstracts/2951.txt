The increasing prevalence of climate change impacts and rising energy prices has highlighted the need to achieve deep energy savings now. To accomplish this, stricter prescriptive performance requirements for residential buildings are needed. The intent of this work is to develop a framework and policy implementation strategy to achieve an 80% reduction in Ontario residential heating energy consumption by 2030. A tiered framework of consumption targets was developed using OBC 2012 SB-12 requirements as a baseline and sample compliance packages created for each tier. Construction costs for the baseline and each tier compliance package were estimated and simple payback periods determined. Impacts of fuel escalation rates on payback periods were also considered. Significant cost premiums were found between the baseline consumption and overall 80% heating energy reduction target. Lack of experience and perceived risk were found to be the greatest barriers to achieving the overall energy reduction target. A preliminary strategy and supporting policy tools was developed, taking into consideration the observed barriers to adoption.
