This qualitative positive psychology study investigated how women experience clothing and how those experiences interact with their emotions, mood, self-concept, and self-esteem, to understand how clothing can influence well-being. Seven women (ages 21-39) participated in a personal account questionnaire, daily clothing diary, and wardrobe interview. This research demonstrates how clothing can uplift mood, reinforce and validate self-concept, boost self-esteem, and enhance well-being. This research contributes to the converging fields of positive psychology and fashion, expands the knowledge on the psychology of clothing behaviour, and highlights the potential of clothing for well-being, providing insight for psychologists, brand strategists, and marketers.
