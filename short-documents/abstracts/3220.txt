This study identified how three high-end couturiers (Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, and Jean Paul Gaultier) incorporate denim in their menswear lines and impose their individual and unique design philosophies or  brands,” defined here as an amalgam of the couturiers’ tangible and aesthetic characteristics. The study chose to focus on denim because of its use in the design and production of jeans, one of the most popular articles of casual wear globally. The study compared the couturiers’ output with similar developments in other luxury brand categories, and combined visual and mathematical analysis to clearly identify the couturiers’ signature designs. Study findings may be useful to future designers creating new products.
