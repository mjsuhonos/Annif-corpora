    Abrasive jet micro-machining is a process that utilizes small abrasive particles entrained in a gas stream to erode material, creating micro-features such as channels and holes. Erosion experiments were carried out on aluminum 6061-T6, Ti-6A1-4V alloy, and 316L stainless steel using 50 μm A1₂O₃ abrasive powder launched at an average speed of 106 m/s. The dependence of erosion rate on impact angle was measured and fitted to a semi-empirical model. The erosion data was used in an analytical model to predict the surface evolution of unmasked channels machined with the abrasive jet at normal and oblique incidence, and masked channels at normal incidence. The predictions of the model were in good agreement with the measured profiles for unmasked channels at normal and oblique impact, and masked channels in at normal incidence up to an aspect ratio (channel depth/width) of 1.25. For the first time, it has been demonstrated that the surface evolution of features machined in metals can be predicted.
