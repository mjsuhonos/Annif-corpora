Very High Resolution (VHR) imagery is becoming indispensable in urban mapping and land management.  But owing to its characteristics, traditional spectral-based building extraction methods are not appropriate.  This thesis presents an automated spectral-spatial integration extraction approach to extract two-dimensional roof outlines of urban buildings from IKONOS imagery.  It substantially improves accuracy, compared with the well-known Extraction and Classification for Homogenous Objects (ECHO) and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA).  With spectral-based Multi-peak Supervised Segmentation (MSS), the approach generates first stage classification.  In the second stage, the original colour image and the first stage result are fed into a spatial structure classifier.  With analysis of overlapped neighborhood's degree of membership to classes, homogeneity and cross-neighborhood structure, the first stage classification is significantly improved.  Finally, buildings are extracted with post-processing.  Compared with ISODATA, Signature Editor and ECHO, unique contributions are three new algorithms: MSS, Overlapped Neighborhood Analysis, and Cross-neighborhood Structure Detection.
