    Providing relevant pre-migration information for newcomers to Canada can have many potential benefits, however there is a gap in understanding the implications of pre-departure cultural orientations (P-DCO) on refugee settlement. This research focuses on the unique resettlement experiences of privately sponsored refugees entering Canada through the Student Refugee Program (SRP). The purpose of this research is to understand how P-DCO impacts the resettlement of SRP participants and identify the effectiveness of such programs. The study uses the theoretical lens of cultural and social capital to understand the role of P-DCO in the migration and resettlement of SRP participants. Individual interviews were conducted with 6 SRP participants, as well as a key informant interview with the SRP Senior Program Officer. This exploratory study contributes to an enhanced understanding of the effectiveness of P-DCO for refugees in their resettlement and advocates further research for other immigrant categories.
