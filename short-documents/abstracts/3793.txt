Cases of dementia in Ontario will grow from 181,000 to 46,000 by 2036.  This accelerating crisis has sparked research on how to design neighbourhoods for those persons with mild to moderate dementia, and how to empower them through built environment changes to remain in their community for as long as possible.  There are numerous benefits for persons with dementia who continue access to their neighbourhood including:  physical activity, sense of dignity, social interaction, autonomy, and psychological wellbeing.  This MRP examines 17 Recommendations (urban design and land use strategies) identified as 'dementia-friendly', within dementia design and planning literature.  Each is then examined against the planning frameworks for Whitby, Ontario, and assessed for its economic impact on a base case subdivision using pro forma analysis.  The effect on the financial return for a developer was minimal, demonstrating that establishing these recommendations as policy is viable, through regulation and incentives.
