This study explored the identity formation of young women from a minority Muslim group known as Ahmadis in Canada.  Nine unstructured interviews were conducted with women between the ages of 20-26. The questions that this study explored were: How do Ahmadi Muslim women understand and negotiate their identities? What are the factors that shaped and influenced their identity? The participants noted various components of Canadian and Ahmadi identity. Being Canadian meant having multiculturalism/ diversity, being accepting, polite, watching hockey and eating foods such as poutine. Being Ahmadi Muslim meant to have a strong sense of community (Jama ‘at), a sense of sisterhood and unity. The study also found various factors
which shaped the identities of these young women which included family, friends, location, the Jama ‘at (community) and parent’s immigration history. Recommendations for theory and practice are provided as well as implications for future research.
