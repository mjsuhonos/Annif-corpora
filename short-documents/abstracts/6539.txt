Signature Analyzer is an analyzer which is widely used for mixed-signal system testing. But its hardware has high complexity in implementation as the application technique is a system with rules of an arithmetic finite field with arbitrary radix. It’s a challenging task. To avoid this complexity here the project is made based on Algebraic Signature Analyzer that can be used for mixed signal testing and the analyzer doesn’t contain carry propagation circuitry. It improves performance and fault tolerance. This technique is simple and applicable to systems of any size or radix. The hardware complexity is very low compared to the conventional one and can be used in arithmetic/ algebraic cryptography as well as coding
