This thesis reports the findings of a study carried out to determine the feasibility of using Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) in the production of newly made concrete at high replacement levels of conventional coarse Virgin Aggregates (VA). The study evaluated the properties of new concrete produced with coarse RCA, in order to address the issues typically associated with the characteristics of the recycled material. Concrete specimens were tested for fresh properties, hardened properties, as well as overall durability of mixes. Making minor modifications in mix design, the drawbacks typically associated with the use of RCA were successfully mitigated at high replacement levels, making up to a full 100% replacement feasible. Through the use of higher replacement levels of RCA in the production of concrete, the environmental impacts of VA harvesting may be significantly reduced, as well as providing a more economical means of waste concrete disposal for ready mix producers.
