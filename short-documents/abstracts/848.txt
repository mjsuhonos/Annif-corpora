    n this these we present a system partitioning technique that employs C/C++ as input specification language for hardware/software co-design. The proposed algorithm is able to explore a number of partitioning solutions as compared to other partitioning research. This benefit is obtained by processing data dependency and precedence dependency simultaneously in a new representation called Directed Acyclic Data dependency Graph with Precedence (DADGP). DADGP is an extension of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure frequently used in the past for partitioning. The DADGP based partitioning algorithm minimizes communication overhead, overall system execution time as well as system cost in terms of hardware area. The algorithm analyzes the DADGP and tries to expose parallelism between processing elements and repeated tasks. The benefits of exposing parallelism with minimum inter PE communication overhead are shown in the experimental results. However, such benefits come with increase in cost due to additional hardware units and their interconnections. DADGP-based partitioning technique is also employed to implement block matching and SOBEL edge detection techniques. Overall, the proposed system partitioning algorithm is fast and powerful enough to handle complicated and large system designs.
