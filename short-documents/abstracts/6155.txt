This major research paper will apply theories of postcolonialism with blackness and social spatiality to understand how social discourses on race are reproduced within an educational context. It will argue that the construction of racialized spaces within the school has negatively impacted upon the academic performance of black students. This necessitates a critical analysis of the Eurocentric and racist educational practices and policies that have affected black academic achievement. An exploration of an anti-racist and culturally inclusive Afrocentric curriculum will also be undertaken to determine if an alternative teaching program, which is rooted in African cultural perspectives, can adequately address the effects of internalized oppression. However, Afrocentricism should not be interpreted as a culturally homogenizing theory of practice. It should instead be conceived of as a strategic essentialism. Ultimately, the psychological resistance to anti black racism, provided by Afrocentricism, should be linked to political actions which address socio-economic inequalities.
