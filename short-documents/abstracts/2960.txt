"I believe that our music does not have sexuality," proclaimed Sara of Tegan and Sara, in an
interview for The Advocate (200S). This paper argues that Tegan and Sara's music videos
do in fact contain elements that reflect their sexuality, and examines the extent to which
these videos demonstrate their public identity. In order to understand the composition of
music videos and the nonverbal signs related to gender and sexuality within them, I draw
upon theories of performed identity, music video genres, settings, and lyrical analysis. In
examining three of Tegan and Sara's music videos, "The First" (2000), "Back In Your Head"
(2007), and "Closer" (2012). I present a narrative structure of their musical career, and
outline how their approach and portrayal of their sexual orientation has evolved over the
thirteen years they have been together as a band. The results show that Tegan and Sara
have increasingly embraced their gender and sexuality over time.
