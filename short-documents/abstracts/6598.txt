As education in Nigeria transitions to play-based learning there is a need to understand parent perspectives as it applies to their children’s education and daily experiences. This qualitative study explored 32 parents’ perspectives of their children’s education pre and post play-based intervention at two early learning centres in Abuja, Nigeria. An ecocultural theoretical framework was used to guide the study. Focus groups were transcribed and analyzed. The four themes that emerged from focus groups conducted with parents at both sites were: parents’ reasons for using the school/care system, advocacy for systematic change, understanding play based education and the connection between home and school. Parents embodied an understanding of early childhood development and curriculum and shared a desire to see play-based learning take place in their child’s classroom. Parents also shared a desire to continue to see evidence of their child’s learning.
