Baby boomers are defined as the demographics born during post-World War II between the years 1946 and 1965. As of 2016, boomers are in their 50s and 60s. As a group, they are interested in pursuing a healthy lifestyle and are willing to invest time and money in maintaining healthy bodies. Yoga, a mind body practice, is an appealing option for this group. A current U.S. national study showed that yoga practitioners over the age of 49 are the second largest group comprising 38% of the yoga practitioners. However, the boomer yoga practitioners do not have many choices when it comes to shopping for yoga wear. Manufacturers of active wear produce the same yoga wear for individuals regardless of age, even though the baby boomer market has different clothing needs and garment design preferences. This study explored baby boomersâ€™ clothing needs and preferences in yoga wear.
