    Cognitive Radio (CR) is a new paradigm in wireless communications to enhance utilization of limited spectrum resources. In the cognitive radio networks, each secondary user can use wireless channels for data transmission to improve the spectrum utilization. This thesis focus on the resource allocation problem for video streaming over cognitive radio networks, where secondary users and primary users transmit data simultaneously in a common frequency band. Respectively, we investigate CR in both single channel and  multiple channels scenarios for single-layered and multi-layered streaming video, which is encoded into multiple layers delivered over a separate channel. Moreover, the source rate, the transmission rate, and the transmission power at each video session in each channel are jointly optimized to provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee to all video sessions in the secondary network. The optimization problem is formulated into a Geometric Programming (GP) problem, which can be solved efficiently. In the simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a lower Packet Loss Rate (PLR) and queuing delay, thus leading to a higher video quality for the video streaming sessions, compared to the uniform scheme.
