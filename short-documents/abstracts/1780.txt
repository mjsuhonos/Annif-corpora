    Frederick H. Evans: Art, Craft and Presentation considers the techniques of presentation used by Frederick H. Evans (1853-1943), the English architectural, landscape, and portait photographer. The discussion focuses on how Evans mounted his photographs onto secondary supports and how these auxiliary materials were embellished by Evans with watercolour lines, paper, and hand-ruled pencil lines.
    The essay categorizes, describes, and analyzes eight types of presentation including the French method and multiple mounting. Other more common types of support and display, such as albus, cards, overmats, and portfolios are also discussed. Described in detail, each method is considered within the broader context of the aesthetic circumstances that influenced Evans. Illustrated with twenty-three images, from George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film, the paper encourages an awareness of Evan's photographic objects, this paper offers a fuller understanding of the layered meaning embedded in one artist's presentation of photographs at the beginning of the twentieth century.
