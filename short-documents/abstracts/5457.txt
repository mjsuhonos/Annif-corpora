his MRP looks at the communication used in environmental advocacy public education campaigns, specifically focusing on those promoting sustainable seafood consumption. Organizations such as Ocean Wise and Seafood Watch aim to educate the public about the importance of choosing ocean-friendly fish, using a variety of communication tools and techniques to achieve their goals. This MRP focuses specifically on communication materials available in the public domain. Looking at the language used by these organizations on their websites, in documents found online and through their use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter, I analyzed a variety of their communications to determine whether they employ particular environmental rhetorical strategies in their public education campaigns.

I focused my analysis by using Herndl and Brown’s (1996) rhetorical model for environmental discourse, which is designed to “identify the dominant tendencies or orientation of a piece of environmental discourse” and “help clarify the connections between a text, a writer, and the setting from which a piece of writing comes in an effort to elicit the underlying motives around a text or topic” (p. 10). This model looks at the relationship between three elements of environmental rhetoric (regulatory discourse, poetic discourse and scientific discourse) potentially found in pieces of environmental discourse. My MRP examines how Ocean Wise and Seafood Watch employ deliberative environmental rhetoric throughout their public education campaigns.
