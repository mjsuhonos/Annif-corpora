Inherently all that is designed is obsolete. The ambition to create an efficient society is followed by a continuous debate over the necessary and the unnecessary built forms. Architecture of the city is a result of satisfying the public desires that change through the inherent obsolescent nature of a progressive society. By accepting obsolescence as an inevitable state, the characteristics of the designed typologies can be preserved to withstand the changes occurring within the city. 

Speculative futures discussed in writings and designs promote both dystopic and utopic state of architecture. By critiquing the usefulness of the built form through these two lenses, a framework that sustains the lifestyles in a technologically dependent society can be developed. Speculating Typologies explores architecture as an adaptive system that conserves the characteristics of obsolete typologies to create programs that will always be necessary within the urban fabric of the city.
