Migration benefits both immigrants and the receiving countries.  While migrants seek a better life and peace in developed countries, these countries also seek to tap into the human capital of the migrants.  Canada, a country which is ranked by [the] United Nations as one of the best countries to live in the world seems to have become the country of choice for immigrants, women inclusive.  In order to reap the benefits of migration, good health is therefore important to both migrant and the receiving country.  For this purpose, Canada uses a system of medical screening to select healthy immigrants who arrived healthy in Canada but, with passage of time some experience decline in their health.  This major research paper therefore examines the decline in the health status of the racialized immigrant women after their arrival in Canada.
