    This project is focused on the research and practical design of a list of subject headings which describes topical subjects visually represented in war photographs. To increase access to this type of cultural heritage, this list is a user-friendly tool for the efficient description of war photographs which does not require specialized knowledge in the subject of war for its implementation. Three main strategies are employed to this end: The implementarion of a strictly controlled vocabulary; the use of a streamlined multi-tiered hierarchical arrangement; and the placement of specific subject headings within the hierarchical structure of terminology that function as key access points to war photography collections. The basis of development of this project is the approach to the description of war photographs of three institutions. These are: George Eastman House Museum of Photography and Film, the Canadian War Museum's Military History Research Centre, and Ryerson University's Black Star Historical Black & White Photography Collection.
