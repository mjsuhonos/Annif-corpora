In bridge analysis, designers calculate maximum bending moment, MT, and shear force, VT, of a bridge girder under truck loading, then use available truck fraction, FT to generate the longitudinal live load effects. This Thesis presents structural analysis of different girder configurations subjected to CL-W truck loading. Girder geometries include single-, two-, three- and four-span girders. The maximum shear, deflection and moments were plotted and then used to develop equations to represent their values. Furthermore, a software was developed to perform composite steel I-girder design. The software optimizes the I-girder size based on CHBDC design procedure. Using the developed software, a parametric study was conducted to determine the required composite moment of inertia, moment of inertia of the bare steel section and steel web area to satisfy all design requirements. Empirical equations for these three properties were developed to assist bridge designers in estimating steel I-section sizes for contract bidding.
