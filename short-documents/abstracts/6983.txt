This Major Research Paper (MRP) is a case study of the queer hip hop and dancehall
party Yes Yes Y’all (YYY). This MRP seeks to challenge white, cismale metanarratives
in Toronto’s queer community. This paper employs Critical Race Theory (CRT) and
queer theory as theoretical frameworks. Racialization, racism, homophobia,
homonormativities and homonational rhetoric within queer discourses are
interrogated throughout the analysis. In pursuit of this research, five participants
and two key informants were interviewed. Four emergent themes are explored:
fluid identities, the intersection of race and sexuality, dancing as expression of
sexuality and gender identity, and the transgressive possibilities of YYY.
