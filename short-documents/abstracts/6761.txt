Outdoor programs are part of children’s everyday experiences in childcare centres. However, there is a lack of research that explores children’s viewpoints on their outdoor programs in childcare centres. This qualitative study examined children’s perspectives using the Mosaic approach. In addition, the early childhood educators (ECEs) were interviewed to investigate how they learn about and support children’s interests. Findings indicate that using the Mosaic approach can contribute to a more holistic understanding of children’s perspectives of their outdoor play programs. Findings also indicate that ECEs use observation and communication to learn about children’s interests. The ECEs also stated that they support children’s interests during their outdoor programs through verbal support and modelling, changing and expanding activities, and preparing various activities and materials for the children. Discussion on the findings explores multiple methods for tapping children’s perspectives, implications for teacher practices, and direction for future research.
