    The purpose of this research is to examine the current state of the film industryâ€™s environmental management efforts, by using the temporary structure of the film production itself as a framework. Film industry experts were interviewed, and a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis was performed using the project-based organization (PBO) as a system boundary. The literature on environmental management for another project-based industry, construction, was reviewed and used as a comparison with the interview results. At present, the greatest strength of the PBO in pursuing environmental management is the social conscience of the employees within the PBO itself. The largest threat is the lack of financial resources. The construction comparison indicated that there was some divergence between the two industries, specifically with respect to competitive advantage and company image. The complex relationship each industry has with its stakeholders plays an important role in the ability to implement an environmental management program.
