This research investigates and attempts to quantify the hazards associated with fire in metrostations. The use of numerical simulations for the analysis of fire safety within metro-stations allows for the prediction and analysis of hazards within the built environment. Such approaches form the growing basis of performance based design (PBD), which can optimize design solutions. The simulations utilize Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and Pathfinder, an evacuation modeling software.

The safety of underground metro-stations is analyzed through the simulation of smoke spread and egress modelling. CFD models of TTC’s Union Station and TransLink’s Yaletown Station are developed to allow for simulations of smoke spread scenarios. These models are evaluated in regards to the preservation of tenability and influence on the Available Safe Egress Time (ASET). The egress of metro-stations is modelled and analyzed to determine the Required Safe Egress Time (RSET).
