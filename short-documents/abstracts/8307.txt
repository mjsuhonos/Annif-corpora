AC-DC power systems have been operating more than sixty years. Nonlinear bus-wise power balance equations provide accurate model of AC-DC power systems. However, optimization tools for planning and operation require linear version, even if approximate, for creating tractable algorithms, considering modern elements such as DERs (distributed energy resources). Hitherto, linear models of only AC power systems are available, which coincidentally are called DC power flow. To address this drawback, linear bus-wise power balance equations are developed for AC-DC power systems and presented. As a first contribution, while AC and DC lines are represented by susceptance and conductance elements, AC-DC power converters are represented by a proposed linear relationship. As a second contribution, a three-step linear AC-DC power flow method is proposed. The first step solves the whole network considering it as a linear AC network, yielding bus phase angles at all busses. The second step computes attributes of the proposed linear model of all AC-DC power converters. The third step solves the linear model of the AC-DC system including converters, yielding bus phase angles at AC busses and voltage magnitudes at DC busses. The benefit of the proposed linear power flow model of AC-DC power system, while an approximation of the nonlinear model, enables representation of bus-wise power balance of AC-DC systems in complex planning and operational optimization formulations and hence holds the promise of phenomenal progress. The proposed linear AC-DC power systems is tested on numerous IEEE test systems and demonstrated to be fast, reliable, and consistent.
