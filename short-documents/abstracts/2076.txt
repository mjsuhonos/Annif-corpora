    Previous studies in transportation equilibrium have focused on models in which travel demands were functions of travel time in the current time period. Most of these models are single-period models, neglecting the time lag effect. However, the time lag effect can be a very important factor, especially in long-term transportation planning. In this thesis the geometric distributed lag (GDL) structure used in energy equilibrium models is applied to the multi-period transportation equilibrium models.
