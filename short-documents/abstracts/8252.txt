Digital forensics allows cultural heritage institutions to validate, preserve, and recover digital objects. This thesis discusses the development and implementation of a custom digital forensics workflow for the Archives of Ontario. The justifications for the workflow are based on research into digital forensics, authenticity, diplomatics, and digital preservation. The workflow seeks to clarify best-practice policies and procedures for using a Digital Intelligence Forensic Recover of Evidence Device (FRED), an out-of-the-box digital forensics hardware solution. The Archive procured a FRED tower requiring an implementation plan and overall strategy for its effective use. Presented in this paper is a workflow built specifically for the needs of the Archives as well as justifications for the processes proposed within the workflow. The BitCurator processing environment is addressed as an integral tool for implementation. Also discussed are modifications made to the Archiveâ€™s FRED tower to produce what I have called FrankenFRED.
