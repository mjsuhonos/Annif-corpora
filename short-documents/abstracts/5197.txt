The following report has been created to provide a broad range of information on current additive manufacturing technologies, their present applications in commercial and industrial sectors and predictions for their future deployment in those sectors. The report also examines the ongoing research and development of a variety of 3D printing techniques. The review is divided into three sections. The first section is composed of one to two page
summaries of academic journals, thesis papers, consultant perspective articles and company releases. Each individual summary provides a synopsis of the article, as well as what the authors foresee as the future implications of the topic they explored. The second section contains summaries and reviews of technical studies on various aspects of several different 3D printing technologies. Lastly the third section introduces implementation strategy for 3D printed components and presents a study that highlights the effect of part orientation on the structural integrity of the printed components.
