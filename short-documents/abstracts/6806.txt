Feminist media scholars have historically centered gender and identity on the
body and visual texts, with the voice exercised as metaphor - immaterial or interpreted
solely as the words spoken. Representative of agency, the voice gets defined as what is
being said rather than how one is saying it. My thesis addresses this gap through an earoriented
analysis of women’s voice within the Canadian radio and podcasting industry.
Centred on the experiences of individual women in Toronto’s broadcast soundscape, I
bring a feminist phenomenological approach to my work to explore the intersection of
voice as both material sound -an extension of the body and thus individual identities- and
the weight of the women’s voice as politically and historically coded. I aim to expand my
work beyond the individual experiences of the women within the broadcast industry and
into the broader discourse surrounding gendered representation for the future of our
Canadian media soundscape.
