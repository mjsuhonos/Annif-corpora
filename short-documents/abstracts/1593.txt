    Building energy, water and solid waste benchmarking and developing meaningful performance indicators can help government and building owners to make effective decisions on improving their buildings' efficiency. For this study, information on 120 Multi-Unit Residential Buildings (MURBs) has been provided. The study entails the following steps: performing energy (weather normalized using the Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM)), water, and solid waste benchmarking for the 120 MURBs, developing meaningful performance indicators; determining performance ranking; and estimating different levels of savings (energy, water, solid waste, cost, and GHG emissions). The most appropriate performance indicator and the benchmarking range for energy, water, and solid waste are as follows, energy consumption normalized by square metre, 141-580 kWh/m2 ; water consumption normalized by square metre, 1.06 - 4.19 m3/m2; solid waste benchmarking normalized by number of units, 1.58- 17.4 yd3/unit. Also, the MURBs domestic hot water system efficiencies are found to be very low (boiler efficiency of 35% to 45%).
