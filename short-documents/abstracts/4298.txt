Green roofs possess the potential to provide a plethora of benefits in the urban environment. The variability among the green roof typologies (intensive, extensive, and agriculture) leads to different benefits when one system is selected over another. By the collection and analyzing of metadata, an evaluation tool is developed to assist green roof designers to meet the goals of their specific project. Included criteria for evaluation are:  water runoff quantity, water runoff quality, maintenance, amenity, and irrigation. The evaluation tool is designed to be compartmentalized, with each criteria treated independently, allowing further expansion, alteration, or refinement of the tool in the future.
