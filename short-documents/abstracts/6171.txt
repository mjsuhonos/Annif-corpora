Horst W. Janson's History of Art - often known simply as Janson - has been considered the bible in the art history textbook market since it was first published in 1962. This thesis examines how historical and contemporary photography was considered and discussed in the seven editions and three revised editions of History of Art, published between 1962 and 2007. The thesis provides a description of the successive editions, discusses what changes and what remains constant, and sketches the larger context in which these changes occurred. The thesis contains an appendix that provides a comprehensive list of each of the editions of History of Art, and records in order of their appearance, all of the reproductions of photographs.
