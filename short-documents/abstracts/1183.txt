    Our experience of the city, private or public, is no longer primarily influenced by physical built form but by various media, digital information, and communication technologies we interact with and through on a daily basis. The shift in influence not only blurs what used to be public and private space, but also modifies our behavior through space and time. Along with some of these technological transformations come new social situations, and with them new spatial practices will emerge. Precisely for this reason, I want to find out the trajectory of the current social situation influenced by information communication technology, and how it will alter future spatial organization both at the urban scale and the human scale. The aim of the thesis is to ask questions and also to provoke discussion of the relationship between cybernetic public space and the physical public space.
