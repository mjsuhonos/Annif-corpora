This research paper explores the discourse of municipal climate change adaptation in the context of planning.  Dryzek's criteria are used which analyzes 4 dimensions of a discourse:  basic entitites; assumptions about natural relationships; agents and their motives; and, key metaphors and other rhetorical devices.  Policies are analyzed from two municipalities in Canada:  Toronto, Ontario and Halifax Regional Municipality.  Analysis reveals climate change is assumed to  already happening and requires action; a hierarchy of vulnerable "objects" including the city, citizens, ecoystems that need protection from a "subject" or the city; experts and government have the responsibility to educate the public; and rhetorical devices suggest urgency which can be used to reinforce a system of hierarchy that alienates citizens from the process.
