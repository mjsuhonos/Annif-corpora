"Salonnieres of the Modernist era have used salon culture as a means to reshape traditional public spheres and social structures. Female salonnieres have been influential, yet often forgotten, figures of modernist art institutions. They used their financial and economic clout to help reshape political and economic social structures. Their example also allows us to study the ways in which finances either limited or allowed women to shape social structures, while proving the importance of their salons within the modernist era as a public sphere and as a space to challenge traditional gender roles. Thus, they helped shape the political and economic dimensions of the future art market."--Introduction.
