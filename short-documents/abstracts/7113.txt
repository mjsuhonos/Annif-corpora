Academic libraries produce and perpetuate their fair share of management speak - or, bullshit.  We create checklists of core competencies to actualize our value propositions. We revere the Thought Leaders in the Innovative Library of the 21st Century. We create synergistic space to incubate the next big game changers. We create and administer committees and task forces that in turn generate a never ending cycle of emails to nail down agendas and meeting minutes. I will reflect on how this proliferation of empty language affects our collective psyche, and what we might do to shovel our way out and focus on meaningful work that provides resonance through all stages of our careers.
