                                                                                                                                                                                                                This digital exhibition is used as a case study for the written component. As such it outlines the criteria that attempt to define digital and virtual exhibitions in 2017. The case study is analyzed alongside research from cultural and historical
institutions and interviews with professionals in Canada and the United States. These interviews and research provide insight into how different institutions approach the worldwide interest of digital exhibitions. This thesis not only examines the criteria of digital exhibitions but also analyzes the success of the case study created for this project. Appendices included in this thesis outline the digitization process, image selection information, web text and layout used during the creation of the case study digital exhibition.
