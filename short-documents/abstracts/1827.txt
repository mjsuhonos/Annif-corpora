    Well designed mid-rise developments are generally recognized for their ability to contribute to intensification goals while at the same time being pedestrian friendly, human scale and compatible with low density neighbourhoods and historic districts. Despite these benefits, mid-rise residential developments between four and twelve storeys are comparatively rare in Greater Toronto Area suburban communities. To assess this disparity, interviews were conducted with municipal planning staff and development industry stakeholders to investigate the financial, regulatory and housing market variables that impact development of mid-rise projects. Building code, parking requirements, land costs and municipal policies and processes were all identified as contributing to high development costs for mid-rise. The market for mid-rise consists largely of affluent households without children that prefer neighbourhoods with good transit connections, vibrant street life and a wide range of amenities. These factors limit the number of locations where mid-rise can be profitably developed in suburban communities.
