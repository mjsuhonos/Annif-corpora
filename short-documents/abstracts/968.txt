    This case study examined whether and how student's perceptions of their role (as they recall them) in a full-day kindergarten program changed after a field placement experience. Qualitative data was collected using a convenience sampling approach and semi-structured interviews. This study has the potential to contribute meaningfully to both the literature on educational practices in Ontario as well to future policy. As well, this study has the makings for assisting pre-service ECE teaching programs to accurately reflect the role of early childhood educators in the education system in Ontario. The combined answers to the three research questions revealed that teachers and ECEs were struggling with the implementation of the FDK in areas of team approach, play-based learning pedagogy and family involvement.
