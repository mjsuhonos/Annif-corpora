Very few students have focused on the health knowledge and practices of Eritrean women and their children in Canada.  The research surrounding Eritrean women and their children's awareness and exposure to sexual health education is even far more limited.  This study aims to fill this gap in immigrant health research through an evaluation of the Raising Sexually Healthy Children (RSHC) Project, a sexual health education program for immigrant parents in Toronto.  Evaluation is based on the Eritrean women's experiences of the RSHC Program as well any challenges and benefits they encountered through its implementation.  Six Eritrean women including four program participants as well as two program coordinators were interviewed.  Findings indicated that despite the cultural taboo of discussing issues of sexual health, the women gained a greater sense of confidence, openness, and acceptance towards this topic.  The study concluded that the RSHC program was successful in assisting the Eritrean women participants to develop effective sexual health communication with their children, family members, and wider community.
