This project is a study on the building impact of occupantâ€™s productivity and well being in an office environment. Presented through an office case study, the work takes part of a larger pre- and post-move study carried out over the course of a year. The study collects, analyses, and compares numerous sources of data in a pre- and post-move study: 1) environmental data using desk sensors 2) online qualitative surveys of user comfort relative to location in the office 3) an architectural assessment of the spaces in the office. The collection of both pre- and post-move data is intended to allow findings to be compared to understand the impacts of environmental design on worker productivity and building performance and address the challenges in conducting successful pre- and post-move assessments.
