One obvious way to reduce the amount of paper waste being discarded, and to conserve the forest resources, is to recycle more of the waste paper. But most common waste management technique for solid waste is the use of landfills. This study was aimed at decomposing the waste in aerobic condition before the anaerobic condition using soybean peroxidase enzyme (SBP). One bioreactor cell without enzyme was compared with two bioreactor cells, which contained different concentration of soybean peroxidase enzyme with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). The rate of reaction was analyzed by performing COD, BOD₅, NH₃, TS and pH tests as well as monitoring the settlement.

The findings showed that the bioreactors with enzyme had faster decomposition rate than the control one. Final COD concentration in control one was 62.6% higher than the bioreactor having higher concentrations of enzyme. Similarly, final BOD₅ concentration in control one was 70.7% higher than the bioreactor having higher concentration of enzyme. Furthermore, the results were compared with the previous study, the bioreactors having municipal solid waste (MSW) with biosolids. The results showed that the strength of leachate quality was much better in bioreactors having paper waste with enzyme than the bioreactor having MSW with biosolids. The COD reduction rate in case of enzyme was about more than double than the bioreactor having biosolids. Similarly, BOD₅ reduction rate in case of enzyme was 1.6 times higher than the biosolids and TS reduction rate was about 1.4 times higher than the bioreactor having biosolids.
