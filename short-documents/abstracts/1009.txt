    Vibration of simulated CANDU fuel bundles induced by coolant flow is investigated in this thesis through experiments and numerical simulations. Two simulated bundles and a hydraulic loop are built to mimic the situation of the fuel bundles located at the inlet of a fuel channel in a CANDU nuclear reactor. Fuel bundle vibration mechanism is investigated through experiments and numerical simulations. The three-dimensional turbulent flow that passes through the simulated bundles is modeled using the large eddy simulation (LES) and solved with parallel processing. The local cross flows induced by the presence of endplates at the inlet location and bundle interface location are investigated. The fluid forces are obtained as excitations for the fuel bundle vibration analysis. A finite element model of the fuel bundles is developed with the endplates modeled using the 3rd order thick plate theory. The response of the inlet fuel bundle to the fluid excitations is solved in the time and the frequency domain. The added mass and the fluid damping are approximated with the theory on the flow-induced vibration of slender bodies in a parallel flow. Measurements are obtained and used to validate the numerical prediction under various operating flow conditions.
