Mining can have significant public health and environmental consequences such as deforestation, waste
rock deposition, and toxic mine effluents. Standards for reclamation of Ontario mine sites are not clear as
there is no received model. A strong policy framework is essential to develop a mine closure system that
protects the environment. An Environmental Assessment is the first stage for reclamation investigation.
By setting standards for reclamation, projects that complete an Environmental Assessment will be better
prepared to meet environmental protection objectives. Based on determined objectives, the best practice
for mine site reclamations must include: restoration of soils, systematic revegetation, reclamation of water
and wildlife restoration through habitat formation. Based on the results, Ontario is ahead of the provinces
evaluated for environmental reclamation. None of the countries reviewed have a firm policy on
reclamation. The results demonstrate a high number of reclamation components not being evaluated at the
environmental assessment level.
