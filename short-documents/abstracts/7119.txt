This research investigates the effect of fatigue loading on the flexural performance and self-healing behaviour of beams and link slabs made of Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC). The influences of fly ash content, types/size of sand, MgO agent, fatigue stress level/cycle and age are analyzed based on strength/deflection capacity recovery and residual strength/deflection/energy absorbing capacity. The deflection evolution rate and energy absorption capacity were much higher in ECC link slabs compared to their SCC counterparts. Higher energy absorption and deflection evolution rate were observed in mortar sand based ECC specimens during fatigue loading. ECC link slabs with mortar sand having 55% fly ash content have shown the best self-healing and fatigue performance attaining high residual strength, deflection and energy absorbing capacity of up to 98.3%, 95.4% and 97.1% of control specimens, respectively besides retaining multi-cracking characteristics. This research demonstrates viability of using ECC link slab for construction of joint-free bridges.
