    In this thesis, we considered the effect of the content delivery network architecture on the popular short video sharing websites such as YouTube. The high number of users demanding videos impacts YouTube scalability which requires a new content delivery structure. Considering the high performance of P2P overlay networks, we propose an efficient peer-to-peer based system for short video sharing in the Internet in which all participant peers are responsible to distribute video replicas they have stored. This system comprises of a BitTorrent like network and a central media streaming server. To proficiently utilize P2P in our system, we propose some important approaches including an efficient and reliable indexing scheme, an efficient downloading strategy, a reliable content distribution mechanism, and a fairness policy. The simulations results demonstrate that the proposed system significantly increases client peers download speed while reduces the server workload and the startup delay for an improved playback quality.
