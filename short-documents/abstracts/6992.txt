The present study examined whether written exposure enhanced with rescripting is more efficacious in reducing GAD symptoms, worry, and related cognitive difficulties than written exposure to the same worst-case scenario or neutral writing. Adults with GAD (N = 67) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions and engaged in 30-minute writing sessions on 3 consecutive days: (1) worst-case scenario exposure; WE (2) written exposure with rescripting; RWE (3) Neutral Control; NC. Participants in both exposure conditions displayed significant reductions in worry and fear of emotions from baseline to 1-month follow-up, but NC participants did not. Participants in the RWE condition also displayed significant improvements in negative problem orientation, perceived cost of the feared scenario, and coping; participants in the WE or NC did not. Findings suggest that overall, RWE was not superior to WE; both written exposure interventions have strong potential to help individuals who suffer from GAD.
