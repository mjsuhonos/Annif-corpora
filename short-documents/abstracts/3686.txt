In Canada, every citizen has the right to pursue their cultural and religious heritage. Temples in the GTA are becoming an ideal place for Hindu communities to express their values in a foreign environment. As a result, they serve a vital function for the community on many levels, including psychological, social, and symbolic. This paper explores how Hindu faith group deal with land use planning issues related to locational constraints and zoning bylaws provisions when they establish temples in their communities. The research is based on a literature analysis of various scholarly works on places of worship and land use provisions as well as views and experiences of members from temple organizations and planners from the City of Toronto on the development process of temple construction. In addition, the paper includes case studies of two Hindu temples in the GTA and looks at the legislative and policy frameworks for places of worship. The research aims to underline the importance of temples in broader social undertakings, such as preserving the Hindu religion and culture for future generations. These research findings provide suggestions for a process for locating temples that meets the needs of both Hindu communities and other residents, and minimizes conflicts related to land use designations such as employment lands.
