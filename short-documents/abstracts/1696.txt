    The way one uses and operates within a space will continue to change over time as needs and desires evolve. However, the success of a space is often dependent on several programmatic elements that enable an intended use. Thus, when looking at changes in needs and desires, time is a factor that can impact a buildingâ€™s program and function. Subsequently, architecture as a notion cannot afford to be static. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for an evolving architecture with programmatic elements which can be continually altered as required. Through this, a buildings ability to evolve will then allow it to facilitate any inevitable change over extended periods; ensuring that architecture is not stationary in time. With an evolving architecture being the thesis position, this project argues for an architectural form that can constantly be transformed to accommodate a function and its changing programmatic needs.
