The overall goal of this document is to present the results of downscaling the SDGs target 15.3 “By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land-degradation-neutral world” and to contribute to raising awareness and engaging with the key stakeholders and decision makers to create a participatory approach in establishing a resilient framework for land sector sustainability in the Republic of Moldova.
The Program, which initiated a wide national consultative process for sustainable land management, was an opportunity to analyze the current land resource use/planning and prioritizing actions with regard to scientific and technical data, capacity building, resources, awareness raising, needs in terms of policy coherence and coordination to ensure an effective implementation and strengthen UNCCD reporting process in the Republic of Moldova. Based on the systems design approach and supported by the comprehensive biophysical baseline information, the Program is a critical input for developing national land sector related policy initiatives.
