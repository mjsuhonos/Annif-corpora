This Major Research Project (MRP) examines the occurrence of Jamaican patois in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) among people of a Caribbean ethnic or cultural background. This project supplies data on the demographic characteristics of Jamaican patois speakers in the GTA and the situational contexts in which they use the language. The study has been developed as a pilot and foundation for further qualitative research in the field of communication to investigate the motivating factors of Jamaican patois use in the GTA. 
This MRP uses the theoretical frameworks of Code Switching (Deubers, 2014; Langman, 2001), Communication Accommodation Theory (Giles, 2008; Gallois, Ogay & Giles, 2005; Giles & Ogay, 2007), and Co-Cultural Communication Theory (Orbe 1996, 1998) to analyze the answers received in response to a quantitative online survey questionnaire. 
According  to  survey  responses,  participants  adjust their  use  of  Jamaican  patois in the  GTA  as  a  means  of  assimilation  and  social  conformity.  Overall, research participants speak the most  Jamaican patois at home and while  socializing and/or engaging in activities outside of the home. Participants with a higher level of income and education  speak less  Jamaican  patois  regardless of  physical  or  social  contexts and a  significant number  of participants speak  Jamaican patois if it works  to  their favour.
These findings indicate that, while Jamaican patois use by Caribbeanâ€™s in the GTA is  associated  with  a  lower  level  of  income  and  education,  the  intra-  and  possibly  intercultural affordances of the language merit further study.
