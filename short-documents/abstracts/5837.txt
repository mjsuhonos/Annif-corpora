This paper will give a better understanding on how complex healthcare facilities such as hospitals are using robotic technologies that incorporate superior Wayfinding systems to carry out tasks and obtain information which originally, were conducted by healthcare workers, nurses and or doctors. This paper will also address the ethical concerns that people have by incorporating these robotic technologies such as: third parties being able to hack into these technologies and collect confidential information from patients, healthcare workers and nurses possibly loosing their jobs to hospital robots and whether or not hospital robots are in fact, safe to be operating within a environment where 
peoples lives are on the line.
