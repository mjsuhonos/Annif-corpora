Calling to mind the senses associated with our memories is something the majority of us think of as a universal experience. But what if you could not bring back the sensations from any of your memories? Silence in the Mind was performed on June 28th, 2017 at Burdock in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, as a live interactive documentary exploring those who are aphantasic: people who do not possess a sensory memory. This project seeks to understand variations on the human experience, and how we as unique individuals perceive the world around us. Silence in the Mind, recorded as an audio documentary, examines a newly discovered way in which some people have always experienced the world around them.
