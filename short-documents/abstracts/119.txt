    The participatory Geoweb emerges from the synthesis of map-based online applications and Web 2.0 concepts such as user-generated content, enhanced interactivity, and cloud computing. The result is a wide range of tools and projects using these tools to communicate, collaborate, deliberate, and inform spatial decision making. This article draws upon the literature in participatory geographic information systems to propose the “3E Framework,” which provides both a structured conceptual model and a practical tool for the evaluation of projects on the participatory Geoweb. The framework deconstructs participation on the Geoweb into the provider and public realms and represents the engagement, empowerment, and enactment processes. It includes 20 evaluation questions that are derived from themes in the literature.
