    The paper, "The Edward Burtynsky Archive" is part of the thesis project submitted by Paul Sergeant in the partial fulfillment of the Master's Degree in Photographic Preservation and Collections Management at Ryerson University in Toronto, Ontario and George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film in Rochester, NY, in 2010. The author proposes the creation of a personal archive/repository of photographic prints for Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky. This guide will describe archival methods for the storage of 1000-1500 large format colour photographs ranging in size from 27" x 34" to 60" x 70". The goal of this project is to produce a resource for present and future researchers concerned with the preservation of colour photography. Through research on the preservation of colour photography and archival storage standards, I will locate a viable space, design a model for storage, source materials, and construct the archive/repository by September 1, 2010.
