    Composite steel box girder bridges have become an effective alternative to conventional plate girders and concrete girder bridges in North America in the past 25 years. A number of ongoing innovations in Canada and elsewhere have the potential of further enhancing the design, durability, constructability, and, by extension, the economics of steel box-girder bridges. The thesis examines number of boxes actually needed, with the aim of reducing the number used at present while meeting all design criteria.
