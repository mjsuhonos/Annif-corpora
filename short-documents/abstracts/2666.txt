In this thesis, we present an approach to solve the joint call admission control and power allo-
cation problem in a hospital environment based on cognitive radio. Specifically, a multi-objective
non-convex mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem with weighted-sum method
for wireless access in an indoor hospital environment has been formulated in order to maximize the
number of admitted secondary users and minimize transmit power while guaranteeing the through-
put of all secondary users and satisfying the interference constraints for the protected and primary
users. To solve this MINLP problem with different weights given to different objectives, we pro-
pose to use the standard branch and bound algorithm as appropriately modified to find the optimal
solution. We also coded a specific program using OPTI Toolbox to find the minimum objective
function value, number of admitted secondary users and all related values such as total system
power and throughput. To analyze the numerical results, we considered three cases with equal
and non-equal weights. We also changed the values of interference and maximum source power
to obtain and analyze different results comparing with the normal one. Our results indicate that
more power is allocated and better throughput is guaranteed while the number of admitted users
is increasing. However, as they increase, the objective function value increases steadily as well,
which means that it is more difficult to reach our minimizing objective.
