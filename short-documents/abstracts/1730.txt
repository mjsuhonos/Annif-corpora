    Implementing a digital asset management (DAM) system can be an expensive and complicated endeavor, especially for non-profit organizations with limited budgets and technical staff. This applied thesis project presents an alternative to tradition DAM systems by utilizing the browsing and searching capabilities of Adobe Photoshop Bridge. For this project, hundreds of photographs were digitized and assigned keywords. By applying descriptive keywords to the digital images and using a file naming structure that references the physical location of the original objects, the objects in the Image Permanence Institute's photograph collection become more accessible to researchers and staff. In addition to providing a workflow, this thesis provided information of digitization techniques and standards.
