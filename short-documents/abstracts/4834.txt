The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) has developed few manuals that deal with inspection and rehabilitation of bridges; such as OSIM (Ontario Structural Inspection Manual), SRM (Structure Rehabilitation Manual), OPSS (Ontario Provincial Standards Specifications) and OPSD (Ontario Provincial Standards Drawings).  Most of these manuals except OPSD do not provide detailed sketches to clarify the theory; therefore, practicing engineers in rehabilitation industry have difficulties during design and construction of rehabilitation projects.  The main objective of this project is to provide a manual called "Bridge Rehabilitation Detailing Manual (BRDM)" for clarifying practicing engineers' problems.
This manual presents the results of a wide research and studies on rehabilitation of about 80 bridges in Ontario.  Most of these bridges are located at major locations of Ontario with high volume of traffic going over.  Out of the 80 bridges, 62 bridges have been considered as case-studies since they were designed and detailed by top ranked and well-known consulting firms in rehabilitation industry.  The most common deterioration and relevant rehabilitation methods were categorized in a database to help the development of the BRDM.  This has been combined with MTO's manuals to result and act as commentary of MTO Rehabilitation Manual.
