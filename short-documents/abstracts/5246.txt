The Internet is becoming an essential communication tool for North American businesses, but to date there has been little research on the expected impacts of using the Internet in a business context. This paper will examine theories of communications, information systems, and organizations, in order to understand what existing research can offer to businesses venturing onto the Internet. It will note lessons that can be learned from previous adoptions of new technologies, and identify instances where existing theory does not inform business use of the Internet and its associated new communication technologies1.
