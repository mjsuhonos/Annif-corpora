Climate change and extreme weather has caused significant damage to critical infrastructure of cities. This paper examines the unique role that Business Improvement Areas (BIAs) can play in increasing climate change and extreme weather resilience. This study was informed by a review of existing resilience initiatives undertaken in Toronto and Vancouver and a series of semi-structured interviews with City and BIA staff to understand the current opportunities and barriers to BIA involvement. A series of ten recommendations informed by research and interview analysis discusses how BIAs can become better equipped to partner with cities to increase climate change and extreme weather resilience.
