The study investigated stigmatization of HIV/AIDS children in Nairobi, Kenya. It involved eight HIV/AIDS infected children aged 7-15 years from Joseph Kangethe Primary school, with an equal mix between boys and girls from diverse ethnic groups. A qualitative approach using interview questions and a phenomenological inquiry strategy was adopted. Data from in-depth personal interviews was transcribed, coded and categorized into themes and analyzed through the post-colonial lens. Stigma was detected through what the children felt about their status and their experiences. Key themes identified were: the children experienced different psychosocial impacts, including fear, denial, shame, fear of isolation and loneliness, and trauma. They confirmed the efficacy of anti-retroviral therapy (ART).

From these findings and supporting literature, the study recommends counseling facilities, provision of anti-retroviral therapy, reconceptualized education using modern and tradition approaches, forums to discuss sexuality and HIV, home based care, community mobilization and empowerment to reduce HIV stigmatization.
