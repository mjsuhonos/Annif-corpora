The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) is a landmark piece of legislation that removes both physical and social barriers faced by people with disabilities. This Act will make Ontario fully accessible to people with disabilities by 2025 through the development of accessibility standards, all while changing the perceptions of accessibility and people with disabilities. This research paper will explore accessibility planning in Toronto. Given that planners work in communicative roles, there is little direction in AODA that discuss engagement activities. Planners must utilize a mix of high- and low-tech methods when engaging with vulnerable communities, especially
with people with disabilities. A case study of methods and planning policies in Berlin, Germany is presented to illustrate strong efforts in designing barrier-free spaces. Examples from Berlin will be then compared to Torontoâ€™s efforts in addressing issues of accessibility and engagement with people with disabilities.
