    Although documentary films offer viewers the chance to learn about the realities and experiences of others cultures, it is also possible for filmmakers to stereotype the people they represent. In this paper, I examine Shelley Saywell’s documentary In the Name of the Family, a film about Muslim youth victims of “honour killings.” I suggest that by framing domestic violence as “honour killings” this film stereotypes and misrepresents Muslim immigrant families. Through an analysis of promotional material and scenes from the film, I argue that the film’s use of Orientalist narratives of difference between Muslim immigrants and mainstream Canadian society contributes to the impression that “honour killings” are cultural and specific to Muslim communities. I further argue that Saywell’s use of the “imperilled Muslim woman” narrative to elicit empathy and compassion from viewers perpetuates the notion that Muslim immigrant families are traditional, oppressive and unwilling to adapt to North American society.
