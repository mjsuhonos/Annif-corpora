In this thesis, we propose a two-level hierarchical clustering-based routing protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs consist of hundreds of thousands of energy-limited sensor nodes that are densely deployed in a large geographical region. Once deployed, the replacement of the energy sources of these sensor nodes is usually not feasible. Hence, energy efficiency is always a key design issue that needs to be enhanced in the WSN to improve the life span of the entire network. Each layer of the Open System Interconnect (OSI) Reference Model should be considered when exploiting the energy constrain in the WSN, the routing protocol proposed in this thesis, which is called the Clustering-Based Expanding-Ring Routing Protocol (CBERRP), lies mainly on the network layer.                  CBERRP gains the preferred performance over two typical clustering-based routing schemes in terms of network lifetime, power consumption and throughput by adopting the concept of cross-layer design.  CBERRP is centralized-controlled by the base station and utilizes the two-level hierarchical structure of clusters (level-I) and chains (level-II) to route and forward the sensed data from the WSN to the base station. In addition, CBERRP can be fine-tuned to support multiple Data Aggregation Qualities for the WSN applications. The performance of CBERRP is compared to analogous clustering-based schemes such as Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and LEACH-centralized (LEACH-C). The simulation results show that CBERRP presents a significant improvement over these two schemes on the performance of overall consumption and the network lifetime by around 50% and 100%, respectively
