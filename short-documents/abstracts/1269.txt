Electronic waste (e-waste) is being generated around the globe at a high rate. High market penetration of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and the fast development of more innovative designs by producers and manufacturers on a regular basis make the current electrical and electronic equipment obsolete faster than before, which contributes towards the generation of more e-waste. To combat the issue, e-waste management programs are being developed, implemented, or evaluated in many jurisdictions around the world. Ontario is one of the jurisdictions that have taken initiatives and implemented an e-waste management program to address the rising quantity of e-waste. This thesis evaluates the Ontario's e-waste management program by using Logical Framework Approach (LFA) as an evaluation framework, and focusing on the criteria for a normative e-waste management program. It utilizes the Swiss e-waste management program as a case study to provide a comparative analysis, and extract valuable lessons through the application of the lesson-drawing approach that can be applied to improve the effectiveness of the implemented e-waste management program in Ontario.
