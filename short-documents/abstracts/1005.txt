    Canadian Aboriginal students struggle to situate their cultural knowledge within a Eurocentric academy, in part because indigenous ways of knowing are informed by a philosophy that is characterized by ‘interconnected’ relationships rather than an isolated system of thought. In accordance with this worldview, this report is shaped by a series of 'interdisciplinary' discussions with the intent to establish an ethical middle ground (or space) for architectural learning that does not exclude an Aboriginal worldview. Supported with a different set of hermeneutic principles the report addresses the need to preserve indigenous knowledge systems thereby encouraging architectural Education in Canada to facilitate and help re-contextualize aboriginal traditions. As a result, this thesis attempts to create an enduring intellectual space for future aboriginal students where they are encouraged to “live the story of their created object” while forging renewed identity pieces in a shared cross-cultural context.
