This thesis is an investigation into the extended use of waste in an architectural context. As resources are becoming depleted, new systems and techniques need to be developed to use what we have more effectively. By studying the material flows of urban construction, new purposes for construction waste can be revealed. This thesis
challenges the current perceptions of waste to that of a nutrient. In order to showcase and frame waste as nutrient, the project proposal is for urban interventions built from waste to be placed throughout public spaces on Ryersonâ€™s Campus. These interventions will inform the public on material reuse and at the same time increase the quality of public space. Typically when waste is used in architecture, the material sources are unique, this thesis questions that notion by investigating materials that are ubiquitous. This thesis strives to answer if and how architecture can add value to waste materials
