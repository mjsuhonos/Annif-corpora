This paper explores the policies and practices of police services in Ontario as they relate to undocumented/non-status community members. The study findings, via interviews with senior police officers, are discussed regarding implications on service provision and police service development of sanctuary city policy and/or the adherence to municipalitiesâ€™ designation as a sanctuary city. The Toronto Police Service is the only police service in Ontario that has a formal directive on service provision towards undocumented/non-status persons. The current procedure is that once it becomes known to a police officer that someone is undocumented the Canada Border Service Agency is contacted and the municipal police service is no longer involved. The challenges in shifting current police practices are identified.
