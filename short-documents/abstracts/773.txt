    Two existing analytical models of particle interference in non-divergent particle jets were modified to include radial symmetry of the particle jet across the nozzle axis, inter-particle spacing, and more complex rebound geometry. Two novel experimental techniques for obtaining the particle spatial and velocity distributions across a micro-abrasive jet were then devised and rigorously tested. One of the above mentioned analytical models was then chosen to be further modified to include the above-mentioned modifications along with the effect of a divergent jet, the ability to simulate high flux cases, and experimentally obtained particle spatial and velocity distributions. All of the models were tested at various jet conditions. The results of the models were quantitatively compared to a previously developed computer simulation and were found to qualitatively agree with previous experimental observations. The modified models allow the critical flux below which inter-particle interference is likely to occur to be determined.
