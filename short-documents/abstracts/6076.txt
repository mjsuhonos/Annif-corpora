The objective of this project is to develop a software tool which assists in comparison of a work known as "M-GenESys: Multi Structure Genetic Algorithm based Design Space Exploration System for Integrated Scheduling, Allocation and Binding in High Level Synthesis" with another well established GA approach known as "A Genetic Algorithm for the Design Space Exploration of Data paths During High-Level Synthesis".

Two sets of Software are developed based on both approaches using Microsoft visual 2005,C# language. The C# language is an object-oriented language that is aimed at enabling programmers to quickly develop a wide range of applications on the Microsoft .NET platform. The goal of C# and the .NET platform is to shorten development time by freeing the developer from worrying about several low level plumbing issues such as memory management, type safety issues, building low level libraries, array bounds checking, etc. thus allowing developers to actually spend their time and energy working on the application and business logic.
