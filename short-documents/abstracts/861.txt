    n ATM network design, self-healing is the ability of the network to continue to provide service in the event of failures, and this compromises both planning and operational aspects. The planning aspect involves optimal/near-optimal network design problems while the operational aspect deals with the implementation of protection schemes using restoration mechanisms, for allocating spare capacity to the network to be used in case of a failure event. This project investigates the survivability (i.e. restoration ratio) - here defined by means of the aggregate restoration ratio - in existing ATM networks based on various spare capacity distribution schemes, with the goal to (1) compare the network survivability for link and path restorations, and (2) determine the effects of various traffic and design related patterns on the restoration ratio.
