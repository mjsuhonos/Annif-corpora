This paper argues for a greater emphasis to be placed on the need to plan cities to better ensure their social sustainability. Through an examination of planning policy, this paper describes the general lack of provisions or conditions in planning policy for ensuring a more socially sustainable future in Ontario municipalities, including Toronto. It is argued that government reform in Ontario has hindered the ability for municipalities to maintain social sustainability. Recommendations are made for the role that the province can take to once again strive for social sustainability through the inclusion of statements within provincial policy that aim to address social issues. It is also suggested that greater social sustainability can be fostered through a more effective and meaningful civic engagement process that serves as a forum to hear the input of citizens in describing the diverse needs of their communities.
