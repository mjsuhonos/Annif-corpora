Two asynchronous conferencing systems were used in subsequent years in a management skills course. These systems had comparable technological features but were not equally effective in supporting the course. This paper
examines differences in the systems and their deployment that led to the success of one and the failure of the other.
Data from student surveys show differences in user behaviors and attitudes toward the two systems.
Qualitative data help to reveal the importance of pedagogy, technology, systems implementation and user
behavior as determinants of successful technological innovation. A model for technological innovation in the
classroom is proposed.
