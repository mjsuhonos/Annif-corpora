    Fluoride can be considered beneficial or harmful to human health dependant on the amount that is ingested. Many methods exist for the removal of excessive fluoride from drinking water; however, not all defluoridation methods are appropriate for the specific local conditions that may be present within a community. The objective of this research project is to evaluate various available defluoridation technologies against characteristics of a successful and sustainable technology, while considering decision-making strategies that may be employed by those selecting an appropriate defluoridation method to suit the characteristics of the specific community that is affected by fluoride-impacted drinking water. An evaluation of the selected defluoridation technologies supports the notion that there is not an all-encompassing defluoridation technology that would be applicable to all types of situations in which fluoride impacted groundwater is a concern. Water treatment methods for developing countries require careful consideration and selection of a sustainable solution so as to provide long-term benefits and applicability. Formal decision-making strategies would be useful tools at the government level to provide a starting point to determine which available defluoridation methods would be viable at the end user level. Researchers, government officials and, most importantly, local inhabitants of suffering areas must work together to achieve the common goal of clean and safe potable water.
