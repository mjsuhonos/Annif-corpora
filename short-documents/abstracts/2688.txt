This thesis examines and compares the rule instruments, institutions, processes (governance
initiatives) and actors engaged in activities that support the remediation objectives of two RAPS:
the Toronto and Region and the Hamilton Harbour RAPs. In terms of methodology, the thesis
was developed using a combination of a literature review and interviews with key governance
personnel. The thesis reveals the diversity of the governance initiatives that further the
remediation objectives, and in particular highlights the fact that sometimes the governance is
collaborative in nature, but in other cases it takes the form of rivalrous “check and balance”
approaches, and that some of the nonstate governance initiatives that further the remediation
objectives were developed independently of any government direction or control. The nature of
the governance initiatives and actors associated with the two RAPs aligns well with the tenets of
the sustainable governance approach described by Webb (2005).
