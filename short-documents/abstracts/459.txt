    Based upon personal experience, existing literature, original data from Toronto 211 and key informants, this research paper identifies the need for the development and implementation of settlement services that meet the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) immigrants and newcomers. These sources of evidence suggest that these especially marginalized immigrants and newcomers receive a cool and minimal welcome and their service options are limited to a very select few agencies that may only meet some, not all, of their needs, and may exacerbate identity conflicts. This paper argues the importance of providing a wider range of settlement agency options to LGBTQ migrants through the intergration of LGBTQ services into both mainstream and culturally specific settlement agencies. With a critical eye to transferability to a multicultural and multi-faith sector, recommendations for ways in which settlement agencies can build or improve their accessibility and services for LGBTQ clients are inspired by research into 'culturally competent and 'safe space' practices discussed in existing academic and practical literature.
