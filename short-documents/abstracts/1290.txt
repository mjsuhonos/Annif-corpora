    Interventions used in helping children with learning disabilities (LD) should consider the impact on the whole child and not only on his/her academic success. This approach may foster the development of unique strengths in the child, unlike those approaches that focus only on the areas of difficulty that the child is experiencing. An approach of this nature focuses on competence generally and differs greatly from traditional approaches, which ignore the importance of non-academic skills in children. The following study investigated the experiences of children with LD and their parents who are enrolled in a strength-based program. Interviews on their perceptions about the program and evaluation of the literature indicated that a strength-based program is effective in helping children cope with LD. The major themes evoked from interviews included recognition of strengths, dependence versus independence in the public school, and life experience with an LD.
