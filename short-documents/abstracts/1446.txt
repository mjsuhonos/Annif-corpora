    In this thesis the study over the topic of analytical approaches for software quality and reliability assurance is presented.  The focus of this research is on a specific set of techniques used for software reliability assessment called Risk Analysis.  Numerous approaches are explored and different new techniques are proposed to generate the risk model of a software product.  These techniques are evaluated and using the results of this evaluation a new risk model (Compound Risk Model) is proposed which is using the advantages of different classes of risk analysis techniques to generate a more precise and practical model to identify more risky components of a software product.  Also a research on the topic of Automatic Bug-Fix using Genetic Programming is presented which can fix logical defects of a buggy code and evolve it to a bug-free code.  Finally it is discussed that these approaches can be used as an automated tool in an integrated development environment to localize the defective components and debug them.
