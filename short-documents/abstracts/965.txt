    This descriptive correlational study used a convenience sample (n=30) recruited from one Canadian School of Nursing to investigate first year nursing students' preparedness for technology use. It examined the students' general technology readiness, attitudes toward computer use in general and in nursing as well as their general computer literacy. Most students were average "techno-ready", had positive attitudes toward computer use in general and in nursing and had low self-perceived proficiency in various computer applications. There was beginning evidence in support of statistically significant positive relationships among the students' technology readiness, their attitude towards computers and their computer literacy. The findings did not support correlations between the students' attitude towards computers and their computer literacy or between their technology readiness and their computer literacy. These findings suggest that some first year nursing students may need additional supports to enhance their preparedness to work in today's technology-rich health care environment.
