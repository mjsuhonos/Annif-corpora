The purpose of this study was to examine how immigrant Chinese mothers of young children from Mainland China conceptualize parenting styles, based on their beliefs and values, and the impact of this in a new cultural context.  A phenomenological approach was used with a convenience sample of five participants from Ontario, Canada.  Three significant themes emerged: 1) behaviour modelling, 2) education, and 3) discipline.  Results suggest culture plays a significant role in the value placed on education and discipline.  Contrary to past research, Chinese-Canadian parenting styles were found to be flexible and to incorporate a high degree of warmth, care and positive guidance through behaviour modelling.  Keywords: cross-cultural parenting, Chinese mothers, immigrants, behaviour modelling, authoritative parenting, authoritarian parenting, autonomous parental orientation, connectedness parental orientation, education and discipline.
