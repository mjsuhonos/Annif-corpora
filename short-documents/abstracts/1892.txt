    This research project identifies the materials and equipment needed to implement Simple Performance Testing (SPT) on Superpave asphalt mixtures. This project can be used as a guide or manual for others who would like to evaluate the performance of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) mixtures. This thesis outlines both physical and mechanical SPT requirements and applies them to the performance testing of asphalt mixtures incorporating different types of mineral fillers. Furthermore, this research evaluates the dynamic modulus of asphalt containing various mineral fillers. The results have shown a small increase in dynamic modulus values when 4% fly ash is used as mineral filler when compared to limestone dust (control mix). Portland cement has also shown an increase in dynamic modulus over the control mix although the increase was less than that observed with the use of fly ash. The higher moduli associated with the use of fly ash can be viewed as beneficial in terms of rutting resistance, but require further investigation for fatigue resistance.
