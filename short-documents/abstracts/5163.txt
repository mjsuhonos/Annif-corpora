Concept design is one of the most important and confusing phases in engineering design. The IDEA process was created to help reduce this confusion and improve concept design practices within the engineering industry. An analysis of existing concept design methods was conducted in order to identify areas for improvement. A systematic process called IDEA was created to address these areas and to assist designers with concept design. In addition, a software interface was created in order to support the IDEA process and improve concept design efficiency. The use of automated tools in the interface helps to alleviate many of the "bookkeeping" tasks in the concept design process. The interface was written in the open source program Compendium. Three multi-disciplinary case studies were conducted to validate the process. The use of IDEA lead [i.e. led] to an increase in the number and variety of concepts generated.
