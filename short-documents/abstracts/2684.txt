The incessant search to understand human cognitive functions has led to the hypothesis
that the brain works similar to a packet switched network such as the Internet [28]. In
this thesis, I have developed a top-down simulator of brain-like networks which uses prob-
ability routing to route data and a distance vector routing algorithm [21] to propagate
feedback to varying depths. I investigate the impact of the feedback depth on routing
table metrics. The results indicate that important performance metrics are affected by
the feedback depth of the routing algorithm but also, to a large extent, by the topological
features of such networks [17, 44]. The results indicate feedback depths from 25 to 30
fill the routing table most efficiently in terms of routing table fill percentage, routing
table fill time and packet rejection ratio. There is also a strong correlation between the
macaque monkey brain and sparse topologies.
