Anti-museum is a thesis about the relations between nature and architecture. The critique offered here is one that
is focused on architecture’s over investment in its commodity and function; parameters that are often neutral to
and independent from the spatiotemporal context in which architecture takes place. By contrast this thesis project
explores different theories of “nature” as that which binds architecture in its context and hence provides an
antithesis to commodification of space.

The design project strives to demonstrate an architecture that documents its own produced, modern nature. In
doing so, the project foregrounds and privileges the effects of the forces of nature (through weathering), as well as
aura and specificity of place over the function and commodity oriented values of space. The overarching aim is to
create a social space that enhances the experience of life in the city and also perhaps leads to a different vision in
the process of space making at large.
