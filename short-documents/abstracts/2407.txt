    With the improvement in technology, the number of vehicles on the roads has increased tremendously over the last decade. As large numbers of vehicles are on the road it has become almost a necessity to improve the driving conditions, provide all the facilities and to make sure that driving is safe for drivers around the world. To utilize this information the vehicle has to alternately switch between control (CCH) and service channels (SCH) effectively. So, in our work we evaluate the performance of vehicles on control and service channels with different duty cycle such that no critical message is missed and multimedia applications can be used concurrently. For this purpose we developed 802.11p simulator and the experiments proved that CCH should use duty cycle of 0.6 as delay tolerant data has to be transmitted over it and SCH should work on 0.3 which is delay insensitive, but generates revenue for the industry by using different multimedia applications as requested by the user.
