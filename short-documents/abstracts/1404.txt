    This study investigated the perceptions of Early Childhood Educators on the needs of English language learners in childcare centres in Toronto, Canada. A modified grounded theory methodology was utilized in the study. Interviews were held with 5 Early Childhood Educators; these interviews were transcribed and coded. 5 themes arose from this qualitative analysis: sensitivity, communication, school readiness, home language retention and socialization. Results indicate that ECEs perceived that English language learners thrive in a caring environment with staff that will guide and support them in language learning, and where the use of their first language is encouraged and used to build the skills in the second language. Recommendations include ensuring the presence of staff that have a first language match with the English language learners, and can speak the same language with the children.
