“We need a base to set down our Being and realize our possibilities (potential). A here from which to discover the world and a there to which we can return to.” (Relph, Edward. Geographical Experiences, Dwelling, Place and Environment, p.27)

In China, architecture is currently employed with a focus towards rapid urbanization in the midst of globalization carried out to satisfy abstract economic goals rather than improving livelihood. This thesis asserts that architecture can serve as a support for rural migrants to aid their transition to urban life. The dynamics of urbanization is embodied in the journey of rural migrant workers who travel to cities and struggle with the disparity between rural and urban living. The lack of availability of services for migrant workers hinders them from reaching their potential. Architecture can transcend its role as merely a device for economic gain and stimulate social change. Architecture can serve as catalyst to create this here and there.
