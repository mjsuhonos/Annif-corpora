Using gameplay, video games immerse players into a variety of different emotional experiences such as excitement, fear and disgust. Other emotional experiences such as sadness, anger and happiness are generally relegated to be expressed by video and audio in games such as cutscenes and voice clips. The goal of this project is to create a game that uses its interactivity to make players feel immersed in emotions not usually found in gameplay. This will be done through the use of VR motion controllers and headsets to make the player feel immersed and more emotionally connected to their actions in the game.
