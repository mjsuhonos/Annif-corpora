Infrared (IR) imaging could be used as both noninvasive and nonionizing technology. Utilizing
IR camera, it is possible to measure skin temperature with the aim of finding any superficial
tumors. Since tumors are highly vascular and usually have a higher temperature than the rest of
the body, using thermograms, it is possible to assess various tumor parameters, such as depth,
intensity, and radius. In this study, we have developed an analytical method to detect tumor
parameters in both spherical and cubical tissues to represent female breast and male chest tissue.
This includes development of analytical solution for solving inverse bio-heat problem as well as
laboratory set up for further validation of the analytical achievements. The models were
developed by solving Penneâ€™s Bioheat equation for each tissue under certain conditions and two
main assumptions:
1. The tumor was assumed as separate heat source;
2. The developed model does not change with time (steady state condition).

Finally, the analytical findings were validated by utilizing a laboratory test set-up containing an
IR camera, 1% Agar solution (tissue phantom), and a heater of variable powers. The models
were set to test by adjusting the heater (0.9W) in various depth and imaging the tissue phantom.
Comparing the analytically obtained results with the experimental results, it can be concluded
that the method is able to detect superficial tumors of small size only by measuring the body
surface temperature and ambient temperature.
