    The trajectory of an angular particle as it cuts a ductile target is, in general, complicated because of its dependence not only on particle shape, but also on particle orientation at the initial instant of impact. This orientation dependence has also made experimental measurement of impact parameters of single angular particles very difficult, resulting in a relatively small amount of available experimental data in the literature. The current work is focused on obtaining measurements of particle kinematics for comparison to rigid plastic model developed by Papini and Spelt. Fundamental mechanisms of material removal are identified, and measurements of rebound parameters and corresponding crater dimensions of single hardened steel particles launched against flat aluminium alloy targets are presented. Also a 2-D finite element model is developed and a dynamic analysis is performed to predict the erosion mechanism. Overall, a good agreement was found among the experimental results, rigid-plastic model predictions and finite element model predictions.
