Aircraft wing geometry morphing is a technology that has seen recent interest 
due to demand for aircraft to improve aerodynamic performance for fuel saving.  One proposed idea to alter wing geometry is by a modular morphing wing designed through a discretization method and constructed using variable geometry truss mechanisms (VGTM).  For each morphing maneuver, there are sixteen possible actuation paths for each VGTM module, and thus offering a three module morphing wing to have a total of 16(to the power of 3) permutations of actuation paths for one morphing maneuver.  Focused on longitudinal static stability, critical parameters and aircraft stability theory, this thesis proposes a method to find an optimal actuation path for a designated maneuver iteratively.  A case study of a three module morphing wing demonstrated the actuation path selection process.  Numerically, different actuation paths had different levels of longitudinal static stability; these paths were drawn in CATIA and were visually verified.
