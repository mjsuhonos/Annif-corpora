The primary objective of this research is to investigate the adaptability of the Scrum framework for large scale projects. A two phase approach has been undertaken towards the goal. The first phase involves conducting a systematic literature review to identify and elaborate scaling practices used in the current industry. The review also identifies the challenges faced by the developers when the Scrum framework is used for the development of large projects. The second phase involves the construction of a simulation model to analyze the dynamic behavior of the Scrum framework for large projects. The systematic literature review revealed that the major challenge while scaling Scrum is ensuring good communication among project members. The communication overhead was incorporated in the system dynamic model of the Scrum framework. The simulation results showed that there is a reduction in work rate when number of personnel is increased due to the increasing communication overhead.
