This MRP positions	 the Schreiner Jewelry	 Company within the framework of the production and consumption of womenâ€™s fashions from the	1930s through to the 1970s. In doing so, it offers	insight into both the historical and material importance of this business and its products, many of which are extant and held in costume jewelry collections today. Archival research, literary  sources,
artifacts,	 and	 excerpts from personal interviews have been used to provide a full picture of this business. This research project validates the importance of studying costume jewelry through an academic lens and further establishes the need for increased research capacity in this area.
