    My paper investigates eight second generation Portuguese from the ages of 18 to 30, across the GTA, and attempts to explore how second generation Portuguese negotiate their identity and sense of belonging in an ever-changing social environment. While there is extensive literature on the settlement experiences of the first generation Portuguese, there is mininmal information on how second generation Portuguese have integrated within the Canadian mainstream. Therfore, this analysis aims to follow the contours of negotiation among the second generation Portuguese, paying particular attention to the formation of identity and constructions of belonging. In addition, this research will seek to answer on mininmal level, other questions on the subject. For instance, how are Portuguese Canadians forming and reforming their ethnic identity? What cost and benefits are involved in belonging/not belonging to groups? How do people maintain individuality within groups?Children of immigrants
