    This study focuses on the problem of reusability evaluation in reverse logistics.  To deal with it, products are categorized into two types:  well established products, and products with fast innovations.  An innovation reliability based model (model 1) is suggested to evaluate reusability of returns for the first category.
    For the second category, a fuzzy multiple participant-multiple criteria (MPMC) decision  making model is presented, which is a modified combination of two previous researches:  the disposal cause analysis matrix (Umeda et al.,  2005), and the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method (van Laarhoven and Pedrycz, 1983).
    To present the application of model 1, a green manufacturing system with an (s, Q) inventory control policy is simulated using Arena.  With the aid of it, the system is analyzed in two situations:  with recovery operations, and without recovery operations to investigate the effects of both model 1 and recovery operations on the system parameters.
