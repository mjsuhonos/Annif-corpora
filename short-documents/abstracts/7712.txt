The pervasive use of glass curtain wall and artificial illumination has saturated contemporary architecture with light, depriving users of the potential experiences achieved through the articulation and interplay of light and shadow. The evaluation of light through quantifiable metric design evaluation denies users of qualitative lighting design expression that influences spatial perception and user experience, engaging the eye, mind and body over the course of the day. Homogeneous and standard lighting solutions deny users sensorial and perceptual stimulation developed through lighting variability and contrast.
This thesis reconciles the use of light and shadow as an architectural design medium to support and enrich the mundane office working environment, establishing a relationship between light, the built environment, and its users. The expression of sunlight, artificial light, architectural form, the physical properties of material, and spatial ambiance improves the architectural experience and spatial perception throughout the day.
