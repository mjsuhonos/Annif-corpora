    Reliability of multicasting is increasingly becoming an important issue as the number of end users continues to grow, their demand for reliable service increases. This thesis proposes a novel algorithm for creating a recovery model while optimizing both inter and intra domain bandwidth. This is achieved by creating a centralized rendezvous point within the intra domain topology. The rendezvous point will create a static multicast tree and it will avoid link congestion during inter-domain link failure. This algorithm also reduces link congestion surrounding the border routers. This is achieved by shifting the root of the multicast tree from the border router to the rendezvous point. This rendezvous point is then selected based on an optimization algorithm to reduce bandwidth congestion. A Steiner tree was used to optimize the intra domain links. The simulation results indicate up to 30% increase over conventional optimization algorithms which do not consider a rendezvous point model.
