    This research paper synthesizes and analyzes existing research on newcomer and racialized youth within the Ontario school system and assesses some conditions under which the educational system is capable of assisting them in building positive social networks. Using the concept of social capital as a theoretical tool for exploration and policy analysis, this study analyzes two policy initiatives designed for economically disadvantaged children within the elementary school system and considers the implications for applying this policy framework to a secondary school system, while paying specific attention to the risk factors and resilience strategies relevant to newcomer youth in Ontario. Ultimately, this paper aims to bring to light the implications for a context-specific model of social capital accumulation for youth.
