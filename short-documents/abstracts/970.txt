    The Fcγ receptor is a cell surface protein essential in the immune response that binds IgG-opsonized particles resulting in phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is a process used to remove pathogens and confine them in a vacuole that will enable their breakdown. The members of the Ras superfamily of small G proteins have been identified in samples where the activated Fcγ receptor complex was captured and analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry. The protein Rap. beloning to the Ras superfamily, guanosine triphosphatases (GTPase) activating proteins (GAPs), which promote the dissociation of GTP, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), that permits the exchange of GDP for GTP, were detected by SEQUEST in RAW 264.7 macrophages and futher analyzed using various methods. In this study, Raps, RasGAPs, and RapGEFs, were observed by tandem mass spectrometry and sequence correlation analysis. The selected isoforms were confirmed by Western blots, live cell confocal microscopy with fluorescent fusion constructs and antibody staining to verify the localization of Ras proetins, specifically Rap1, p120RasGAP and C3G, a RapGEF, to activated Fc reeceptor [sic].
