This thesis analyzes the archive of Frank “Franz” Johnston, a prolific Canadian painter and founding member of the Group of Seven. Johnston, known predominantly to the public as a painter, was also an amateur photographer who used photography as visual aids for his paintings. Johnston’s production and use of photography was extensive, yet it has been relatively ignored until recently. The focus of this thesis is the interrelation between Johnston’s  paintings and photographs in an attempt to understand his artistic practice. Furthermore, this thesis includes a practical component; the substantial documentation of all items pertaining to the Johnston Archive, housed at the Archive of Modern Conflict (AMC) Toronto, Ontario, in the form of a catalogue. The assorted materials of photographs, postcards and ephemera, generally depict images of aboriginal life and the Canadian landscape. This catalogue will facilitate future access to the collection to both AMC personnel and future researchers.
