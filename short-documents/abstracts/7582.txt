Compilers are the interface between programmers and computers. The output of a compiler
determines the speed of the resulting program as well as its energy footprint -- of
increasing importance in this world of climate change and battery-dependent computing.
Code coagulation has the potential to improve that performance, particularly relative to
(JIT) interpreters. Java and related languages are in wide use, so addressing their performance
has large potential impact. Optijava is an experimental compiler that applies
code coagulation to Java programs.
