Background
At present, infrared (IR) imaging is used both as a non-invasive and a non-ionizing technology. Using an IR camera, it is possible to measure body surface temperature in order to detect tumors and malignant cells. Tumors have a high amount of vasculature and an enhanced metabolism rate, which may result in an increase in body surface temperature by several degrees above its normal level.
