    Large-scale integration of Wind Generators (WGs) with distribution systems is underway right across the globe in a drive to harness green energy. The Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) is an important type of WG due to its robustness and versatility. Its accurate and efficient modeling is very important in distribution systems planning and analysis studies, as the older approximate representation method (the constant PQ model) is no longer sufficient given the scale of integration of WGs.
    This thesis proposes a new three-phase model for the DFIG, compatible with unbalanced three-phase distribution systems, by deriving an analytical representation of its three major components, namely the wind turbine, the voltage source converter, and the wound-rotor induction machine. The proposed model has a set of nonlinear equations that yields the total three-phase active and reactive powers injected into the grid by the DFIG as a function of the grid voltage and wind turbine parameters. This proposed model is integrated with a three-phased unbalanced power flow method and reported in this thesis. The proposed method opens up a new way to conduct power flow studies on unbalanced distribution systems with WGs.
    The proposed DFIG model is verified using Matlab-Simulink. IEEE 37-bus test system data from the IEEE Distribution System sub-committee is used to benchmark the results of the power flow method.
