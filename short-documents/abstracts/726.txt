    t is necessary, with the revolution from analog to digital platforms, to evaluate the effect these "new media" have on audience's comprehension of information. The New Spectator examines the varying experiences of audiences with three cinematic platforms: the theatre, online, and mobile media. By testing the experience of seventy-five individuals, watching two short films, the study examines the difference between the cognitive experiences of the spectators. Using an anonymous questionnaire to gain empirical data about the participant's understanding of the films, the study provides evidence of the shift in how the contemporary spectator views a film and their differing apprehensions of the information received from the films.
