    Recent advances in sensor technology and wireless communications have led to many new data dissemination routing protocols, especially designed for wireless sensor networks, where energy awareness is the most important consideration. The focus of this thesis is on the area of routing protocols for wireless sensor networks, especially for those applications where, the whole sensor field need to be taken under observation to detect available different types of moving objects. Besides the efficient use of limited energy, reliability is another important issue in sensor communication, where the network is susceptible to environmental factors. In this thesis, the design of a new energy-efficient data-centric routing protocol, named Reliable and Energy-Efficient Protocol (REEP), is proposed. We have used MATLAB 7.4 for our implementation. The performance of REEP has been compared with Directed Diffusion (DD) for the aforementioned sensor network application. Our simulations and experimental results show that REEP performs better than DD.
