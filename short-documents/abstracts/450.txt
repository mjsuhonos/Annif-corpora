    Positioning using low-cost, single-frequency GPS receivers provides an economical solution, but these receivers are subject to biases leading to degradation of the accuracy required. Factors contributing to degradation in the accuracy of low-cost systems are ionospheric delay, multipath, and measurement noise. Unless carefully addressed, these errors distort the ambiguity resolution process, and result in less accurate positioning solutions. However, with the modern hardware improvements, measurement noise is now almost neglibible. Ionospheric delay has been dramatically reduced with the availablity of global or local ionospheric maps produced by various organizations (e.g., International GNSS Service (IGS), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administraion (NOAA). The major remaining constraint and challenging problem is multipath. This is because mulitpath is environmentally dependant, difficult to model mathematically, and cannot be reduced through differential positioning. The research proposes a new approach to identify multipath-contaminated L1 measurements. The approach is based on wavelet analysis using Daubechies family wavelets. First, the difference between the code and carrier phase measurements was estimated, leaving essentially twice the ionospheric delay, multipath and system noise. The ionospheric delay is largely removed by using high resolution ionospheric delay maps produced by NOAA. The remaining residuals contain mainly low-frequency multipath, if existed, and high-frequency part of the residual component described above.
    The L1 measurements obtaines from the staellites with lowest multipath were used to compute the final positions using Trimble Total Control (TTC) and Bernese scientific processing software packages. The AC12 single-frequency GPS receiver was extensively tested in static and kinematic modes. Accuracies within 5 cm was demostrated for baselines up to 65 km under various multipath environments.
