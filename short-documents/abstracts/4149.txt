As a part of achieving specific targets, business decision making involves processing and analyzing large volumes of data that leads to growing enterprise databases day by day. Considering the size and complexity of the databases used in todayâ€™s enterprises, it is a major challenge for enterprises to re-engineering their applications that can handle large amounts of data. Compared to traditional relational databases, non-relational NoSQL databases are better suited for dynamic provisioning, horizontal scaling, significant performance, distributed architecture and developer agility benefits. Based on the concept of Object Relational Mapping (ORM) and traditional ETL data migration technique this thesis proposes a methodology for migrating data from RDBMS to NoSQL. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated through a comparative analysis of RDBMS and NoSQL implementations based on query performance evaluation, query structure and developmental agility.
