    Although people can become lonely at any age, older people are more likely to experience loneliness due to changes and losses that accompany aging. Older women are more likely to be lonely owing to their greater longevity as compared to older men (Hall & Havens, 1999). This situation can be worse for older immigrant women (Guruge, Kanthasamy & Santos, 2007). The purpose of this study was to uncover the experience of loneliness among older Sinhalese women in Toronto. Using a narrative inquiry approach (Clandinin & Clonnelly, 2000), I conducted in-depth individual interviews with two Sinhalese immigrant women. Study findings show that their feelings of loneliness were triggered due to loss of status and privilege, declined social network, negative role transition, and family oppression. Practice implications can include: work towards strengthening and expanding older immigrant women"s social network in order to create a conducive environment for psychosocial health and wellbeing.
