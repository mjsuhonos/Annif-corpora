    Zinc, nickel and propylene glycol methyl ether were simultaneously removed from simulated wastewater in a column containing a counter-current packed bed and an electrochemical cell. Rectangular porous aluminum foam cathode and porous stainless steel anode were used in a plate-in-tank configuration. During combined biological and electrochemical treatment the wastewater flux was 0.00183 and 0.00915 m³.m̈².s̈¹ at a constant volumetric air flux of 0.0518 m³.m̈².s̈¹. Over a 72 hour treatment period the BOD5 was reduced by 32% and 55% for each volumetric liquid flux, respectively; zinc was reduced by 98% for both fluxes, and nickel was reduced by 95% and 82%, respectively. For sole electrochemical treatment of 48 hours, laminar and turbulent flow conditions were studied. Operating in the laminar flow region of 0.00183 and 0.00915 m³.m̈².s̈¹; zinc was reduced by 95% for both fluxes; nickel was reduced by 80% and 60%, respectively. For the turbulent region in the electrochemical cell, the volumetric liquid fluxes were 0.0137, 0.0229, 0.0321 and 0.0366 m³.m̈².s̈¹. Per cent reduction of both zinc and nickel in this region was less than that encountered in laminar flow. For all the fluxes in the turbulent region zinc was reduced by 82%; nickel was reduced by 55% at a flux of 0.0137 m³.m̈².s̈¹ and 60% at a flux of 0.0366 m³.m̈².s̈¹. Increasing electrode surface area as a means of improving heavy metal reduction by using rectangular porous material in a plate-in-tank configuration is not a viable option at higher volumetric liquid fluxes.
