This paper presents a critical review of scholarly literature discussing the relationship between community gardens and newcomers in Canada using an environmental justice framework. Specifically, this paper focuses on how the creation of a community garden policy can lead to community gardens being more socially inclusive spaces for newcomers. The numerous social and health benefits of community gardens are discussed in order to illustrate the need for continued research to focus on creating positive spaces within community gardens for newcomers. An examination of how environmental justice can affect considerations for policy creation and the implications the policy can have on newcomersâ€™ use of a garden will also be conducted. Based on the research, recommendations on how municipalities can use community gardens as tools for integration are presented.
