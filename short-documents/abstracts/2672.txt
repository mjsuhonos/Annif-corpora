This thesis presents the applied project of housing, intellectually arranging and creating a finding aid for the Schostal Agency collection at the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO). This collection includes 5,066 gelatin silver prints, 58 information sheets, and 34 photograph envelopes dating from the late 1920s to mid 1940s. The paper is structured in two parts: 1) an analytical paper, and 2) the finding aid. Part one investigates the historical context of the Schostal Agency, finding aids and collections management practices, as well as the methodology for organizing, housing, and creating the finding aid. Part two is the finding aid, which includes a descriptive summary, administrative information, scope and content of the collection, biographies and historical sketches, box lists, and a summary box list tracing the collection as a whole. This document will be made available to researchers in the Marvin Gelber Print and Drawing Study Centre at the AGO.
