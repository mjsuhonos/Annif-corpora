Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) employs optical window of 650-1100 nm to measure the concentrations of different chromophores such as, oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2), deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) and water. In addition, changes in the redox cytochrome c oxidase (Cyt-ox) can be measured using hyperspectral NIRS. Cyt-ox has a relatively low concentration compared to HbO2 and HHb therefore its measurements is very
challenging.
The main objective of this thesis was to identify the best signal-processing algorithm for deconvolution of the Cyt-ox changes.
In this thesis two different studies have been done; in the first study, functional broadband NIRS during simulated driving (on 16 adult subjects) has been recorded and the best data processing algorithm for deconvolution of the chromophores was identified. In the second series of experiments broadband NIRS data during cardiac arrest and
resuscitation was recorded on 19 pigs. A novel signal-processing algorithm was introduced to deconvolve Cyt-ox.
The Introduction section covers relevant aspects of the theory and mathematical concepts. The Journal Manuscript part contains the two projects mentioned above. The last part is The Journal Manuscript part contains the two projects mentioned above. The last part is allocated for the overall conclusion of the entire thesis.
