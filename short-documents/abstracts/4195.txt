Our bodies are in constant dialogue with our built environment: we move to experience architecture, and in turn, are moved by its presence. Movement is intrinsically linked to the way we experience our buildings, yet the body
in motion has not been acknowledged for understanding and conceiving architectural form. In this thesis, the phenomenon of kinesthetic empathy will be unleashed within the exploration of a choreographic architecture,
where body, form and movement share an entangled relationship in the creation of an architectural composition. This approach investigates an architecture that embraces gestural and physiological behaviour for the development of a corporeal environment capable of stimulating and reawakening the mind and body. With the current technologies available for analyzing human movement, this investigation probes human kinesis as an external force for the formation of space, and thus, cultivates a new theory towards making architecture move â€” choreographing an architecture of kinesthetic empathy.
