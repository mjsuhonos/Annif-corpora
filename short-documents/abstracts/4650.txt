Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is very useful in present day engineering. The aim of this thesis is to develop and utilize an MDO procedure that can be applied to stamped and welded structures. This procedure involves new techniques such as material selection, weld constraint, and cost optimizations. The MDO is developed through five design iterations starting with a simple finite element model. As more techniques are added, the procedure progresses towards using a real life radiator support structure in a static loading case. Three trials were completed to optimize the cost of the structure; the final result is that the total cost was minimized by 20%. The MDO procedure was also applied to a real life wheel chair ramp model from a modified minivan. This structure was subject to a rear crash situation and the total mass, after the procedure was applied, was reduced by 19%.
