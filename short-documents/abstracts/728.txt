    This thesis explores the utility of a production system development process (PSDP) map as a tool for identifying process improvement opportunities with a focus of integrating human factors (HF) into work system design. In this university-industry action research collaboration with a Canada-based electronics manufacturer, 91 meeting events involving 31 personnel took place. The creation and application of the PSDP map led to process improvement ideas with an implementation plan over 14 sub-projects, as well as evidence of organizational change towards applications of proactive HF in design. Results showed that critical issues of PSDP mapping initiatives include data collection methods, scoping, level of detail, style, content and implementation. It was concluded that a process mapping approach to work system design is an effective method for identifying process improvement opportunities with consideration for human capabilities, though further research is required for implementing and sustaining process improvement changes.
