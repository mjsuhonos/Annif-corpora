    This thesis engages with our experience of architecture in the everyday. We appropriate spaces in a state of distraction. It slips past unnoticed by our critical minds. It is not until we look through the eyes and minds of artists that we begin to ‘see’ our everyday environment. But as soon as we ‘see’, we contemplate architecture as abstracted art. This mode of seeing distances architecture away from our daily experience.
    This thesis searches for the possibility to superimpose, on top of our passiveness, a critical and creative perception of spaces in the everyday. This perception allows us to be far enough to ‘see’, while at the same time close and loose enough for questions and reinterpretations. Montage carries the critical and creative potential to encourage such a perception. This thesis explores and reveals aspects within montage and their engagement with architectural design to put forward this other possible perception.
