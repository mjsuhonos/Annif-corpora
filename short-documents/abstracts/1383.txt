    "Architecture is a constant journey across the boundaries of binary realms: of science and art; visible and invisible; inside and outside. Architectural education is simply the practice of soaking into these worlds, moving in between, and creating new ones. The role of academy is to not only raise the consciousness of these thresholds, but to become the conductor for those cross-boundary movements. In this project, the possibility of weaving the heart of the pedagogy, the individuals, to the architectural milieu is examined. The institute is defined as a processor which embraces the spontaneous linearity of individual's growth. It becomes the "Bazaar", in which the possibility of knowledge transfer becomes endless. The physical environment is formed through a weave of pedagogical ribbons. Each ribbon is defined base on the communicative nature of contained labs. The weave emphasizes "thresholds" throughout a temporal experience of constant separation and reintegration."
