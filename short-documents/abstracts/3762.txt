The rapidly changing technology of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), or drones, has potential uses in many aspects of urban life, including in the planning profession.  Compared with current alternatives, UAVs could potentially provide a superior low cost, adaptable and accurate data gathering tool for planners.  Presently however, government regulations on the use of UAV's in Canada, especially in urban areas, are very loosely defined with a general focus on safety rather than fostering innovation towards a more efficient system.  Urban planning professionals need well-reasoned, flexible, UAV - specific regulations that will address the complex issues related to the urban use of drones, in order to derive the maximum public benefit from use of this technology in planning.
