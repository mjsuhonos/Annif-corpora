    Achieving energy efficiency with thermal control in residential houses is crucial for the reduction in the energy consumption. Timber framing as the main structural component in the building envelope has a big influence on the effective R-value depending on the framing percentage, and this impacts the overall thermal performance of the building. This project, carried out in Canada, measured the typical framing percentages that are achieved in residential construction sites and compares them with code recommendations. It provides framing factors measured for 17 residential units under construction including detached, row-housing, and semi-detach dwelling units in three different locations in the Toronto area. Detailed on site measurements provide data for numerical calculation to evaluate the amount of framing within external walls, ceilings, and exposed floors. The overall framing factor calculated for each dwelling is found to exceed the recommended percentage by Canadian Model National Energy code for dwellings and ASHRAE Handbook- Fundamental. The research considers the impact that additional regular thermal bridging from the increased framing percentage will have on the effective R-value, and consequently, the impact on thermal effectiveness of the envelope leading to an increase in the overall energy above the expectations of the codes and standards.
