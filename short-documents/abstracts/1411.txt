    This research investigated the behaviour of a new form of composite shear wall system consisting of two skins of profiled steel sheeting and an infill of concrete under in-plane monotonic, cyclic and impact loading. The extensive experimental, analytical and numerical investigations of composite shear walls provided information on strength, stiffness, load-deformation response, steel sheet-concrete interaction, stress-strain characteristics and failure modes.Eight composite wall specimens with overall dimensions of 1626 mm (height) x 720 mm (width) were tested under monotonic, cyclic and impact loading. Steel sheet-concrete connections were provided by intermediate fasteners to generate composite action. Two types of steel sheets classified based on strength as mild and high strength and also, two types of concrete-infill namely Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC) and Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) were used to construct the walls. An analytical model for shear resistance of the composite wall was developed based on existing models taking into account the shear capacity of the steel sheets, concrete core and steel-concrete interaction. Moreover, two non-linear finite element models for the composite wall under monotonic/cyclic and impact loading were developed using proprietary ABAQUS/CAE software. The performance of developed numerical models was validated against experimental results and then the models were utilized to carry out an extensive parametric study to understand the influence of material and steel-concrete interaction on the structural behaviour of the walls.
