This paper takes a multi-step approach to answer the research question “What are the factors that affect the consumers’ EV purchasing decision-making process and how do they affect it?” In order to answer this question, this paper studies consumer data from the last 15 years. Using Hierarchical cluster analysis, this paper shows how the importance of the factors changes over time. A predictive model has been developed using Ethnographic Decision tree Modeling (EDTM) for the decision-making process of the owners of the 4 top selling EV. The top selling EVs includes models of Nissan Leaf, Tesla, Chevy Volt, and Toyota Prius, from year 2009 to 2014. This EDTM model indicates that while consumers prefer variables such as gas requirement, performance and mile coverage over other variables when deciding to purchase an EV, when given several options of EV they consider other variable such as the environment, brand and country of vehicle production to be more important.
