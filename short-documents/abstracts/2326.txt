This paper examines youth engagement within the Kingston-Galloway neighbourhood and asks: How can youth from priority neighbourhoods participate in their community in ways that foster both their own development as well as their neighbourhood’s development? The current approach to youth engagement in Toronto is heavily focused on intervention strategies that try to address the “youth problem” as opposed to promoting youth development. The absence of a youth development approach impedes on the ability of youth to foster development of their neighbourhoods. Based on a review of the literature and relevant policy documents, interviews with service providers and North American case studies, this paper recommends that the City of Toronto commits sustainable funding for youth services and programs, engages in a youth consultation forum, develops a youth policy framework and creates more employment opportunities for at-risk youth.
