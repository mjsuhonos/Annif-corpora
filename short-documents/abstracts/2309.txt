    Message security in multi-hop infrastructure-less networks such as Mobile Ad Hoc Net- works has proven to be a challenging task. A number of trust-based secure routing protocols has recently been introduced comprising of the traditional route discovery phase and a data transmission phase. In the latter, the action of relaying the data from one mobile node to another relies on the peculiarity of the wireless transmission medium as well as the capability of the source nodes to keep their energy level at an acceptable and reasonable level, posing another concern which is that of energy efficiency.
    This thesis proposes an Energy-Aware Trust Based Multi-path secured routing scheme (E-TBM) for MANETs, based on the dynamic source routing protocol (DSR). Results show that the E-TBM scheme outperforms the Trust Based Multi-path (TBM) secured routing scheme [1], chosen as a benchmark, in terms of energy consumption of the selected routing paths, number of dead nodes, trust compromise and route selection time, chosen as performance metrics.
