The use of Augmented Reality (AR) as an immersive and interactive engagement tool for art and cultural institutions is increasing. AR, when used in a meaningful way, has shown great potential for discovery-based learning experiences. My research considers the potential of AR for photographic collections in museums and archives by addressing two key questions. How can digital tools like AR serve to enhance our understanding of photographs as both object and image? What are the implications and limitations of this technology when used for this purpose?
These questions are explored further in the form of a creative project that builds on how AR can be used to enhance interaction with photographic material in archives. These questions are explored further in the form of a creative project that builds on how AR combined with multimedia storytelling can be used to interact with photographic material in archives.
