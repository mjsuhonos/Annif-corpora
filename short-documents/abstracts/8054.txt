Aerial adventure attractions are intended to produce exhilarating sensations at significant elevation, speed, and acceleration, all while maintaining the safety of the participant. While Zip Line designers and owners can refer to international standards addressing many safety requirements, the measurement and assessment of acceleration exposures of the Zip Line rider has not been standardized. My major research project (MRP) considers the design and validation protocol for wearable sensor technology to collect acceleration and g-force exposure of a Zip Line rider. Introducing the combination of systematic design and quantitative analysis to wearable technology architectures requires considerable thought taking into account existing ride
standards, biomechanics, ergonomics and the need for data accuracy. The primary objectives are two-fold, 1) contribute a test protocol that will evaluate the reliability and validity of the proposed system, and 2) take a step forward towards implementing a consistent process to capture acceleration exposure on Zip Line attractions. We contribute a test protocol that will evaluate the reliability and validity of the proposed system.
