    The death of a parent is one of the most significant and traumatic events children encounter throughout their lives. During this difficult time, educators are uniquely positioned to support grieving children because the classroom may be the primary setting in which children begin to express their grief. The extent to which students express their feelings depends on the classroom climate. The classroom can provide the stability and security grieving children need. Trust and rapport can also be established as educators discuss illness and death. Providing children with accurate information helps prevent misconceptions and worrying associations that can complicate reactions to death and loss. This study explores childhood grief with a focus on how the death of a parent affects children, as perceived/understood through their parents, and aims to provide educators with knowledge and skills to enhance their support of grieving children and their families.
