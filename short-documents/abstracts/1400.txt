    The objectives of thesis paper were to examine the current self-perceived health status of Korean immigrants and identify their health determining factors, particularly the impact of acculturative stress. Also, the use of primary health care services in Canada and the choice of participants' alternative use of health coping strategies were also under careful scrutiny. A qualitative approach was used based on focus groups and analysis was set within the population health perspective. The results indicated that acculturative stress was a major health-determining factor among participants. High acculturative stress and barriers to using Canada's primary health care system increased patterns of demands for outside of primary health care system, such as access to emergency department services. Also, continuously experiences difficulties in using the regular health care services, the Korean participants chose to utilize their high transnational activities and accessed medical services in their homeland.
