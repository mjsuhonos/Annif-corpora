Free convective heat transfer from an idealized window with an insect screen attachment was studied using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. An experimental model was set up with an isothermal plate, two commercially available screens (KHP=8.74×10-9 m2, tHP=0.29 mm and KLP=3.40×10-9 m2, tLP=0.65 mm) and window to screen spacings of b=2 cm and b=1 cm. Heat transfer measurements using finite fringe interferograms were taken at a Rayleigh number of Ra=5.30×107 based on window height. Infinite fringe interferograms were taken for temperature field visualization. Screen temperature was also measured. Experimental results were compared to a preliminary CFD model developed with SolidWorks Flow Simulation and show good agreement. The results show that an insect screen produces a reduction in the convective heat transfer from the indoor glazing. The current measurements show that the effect of window to screen spacing is small. Results from this study are expected to be used for the validation of CFD models and for the development of correlations.
