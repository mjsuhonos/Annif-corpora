    Six portfolios produced between the years 1987 and 1992 have been offered to the Deparment of Photographs at George Eastman House. Assembled by the faculty and staff of the School of Photographic Arts and Sciences (SPAS) at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), they contain a total of 169 photographic prints of various processes made by 52 participants. An acquisition report is needed in order for the acquisition committee to understand the portfolios and make an informed decision as to whether they should be acquired for the collection. The main focus of this thesis is an acquisition report for the six portfolios. It also includes a brief history of photographic education at RIT followed by an overview of the portfolios and their production, which relies on correspondence with many of the participants.
