Curated Memories will examine how Toronto’s industrial heritage buildings and landscapes embody memory through a historical architectural narrative. Memory can be considered a projection of time revealed as layers of intellectual or physical events comprising the foundations of what we experience in the present. Moments of reflection or physical expression become manifested and it is manifested memory which will be explored through social and personal history, materiality and the senses. With a history of over 13,000 years, still not fully unearthed, Toronto’s Davenport corridor is contributing to its evolving urban landscape. Its fabric articulates relationships between revealed relics and the memories that have shaped Toronto’s development. The Bridgman Transformer Station will be explored through tangible moments of memory illustrating how new memory can be revealed, embedded and absorbed into the present and future landscape.
