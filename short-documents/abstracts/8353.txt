Sustainability Issues:
• Each ton of cement production-one ton of carbon-dioxide, 1 kg of sulphur dioxide (SO2), 2 kg oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
and 10 kg dust into the atmosphere (Zhang et al., 2018)

• Shortage of Landfill sites
Optimum Solution:
Geopolymer concrete (GPC)- novel form of concrete, synthesized by the alkali activation of source materials (aluminosilicate rich materials) ( Davidovits, 1991).

On Site Feasibility Problems:
• Highly corrosive alkaline solution-based reagents
• Heat Curing

Feasible Solution: Dry Mixing Technique
• Powder-based reagents: required in less quantity
• Source Materials: aluminosilicate rich materials
• No need of heat curing
