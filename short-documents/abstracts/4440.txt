This paper aims to provide a systematic methodological approach for online brand community assessment across multiple social networking platforms. Analysis of influential brands was conducted utilizing a social network analysis (SNA) perspective. Brand communities were scored based on network properties and content analysis. Background research provided a framework of recommended community enablement strategies to determine what type of content and approach is most conducive to brand community proliferation.
Based on network analysis and on congruency of following academically suggested community enablement triggers and behavioural dimensions, it was determined that the most effective brand at enabling community across all platforms within the study was Yeti Coolers. Instagram was the focal platform providing engaging content to be shared across networks
