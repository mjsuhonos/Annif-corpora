This study presents an on-street parking model for downtowns in urban centers
that incorporates the often-neglected parking demand of commercial vehicles. The
behavior of truck deliveries is distinctly different from commuter parking: trucks do not
cruise for parking spaces when parking is saturated, instead they are more likely to
double-park near their destinations and occupy a travelling street lane. 

The study generalizes the downtown on-street parking model from Arnott and
Inci (2006) to investigate the relationship between commercial and passenger vehiclesâ€™
parking behaviors, and provide tools for policy makers to optimize the trade-offs in
parking space allocation, pricing, and network congestion. The social optimum can be
obtained by solving a nonlinear optimization problem.

The model is applied to a case study of downtown Toronto. It is shown that
developing an inclusive policy, one that captures the effect of all road users including
commercial vehicles, leads to considerable efficiency gains.
