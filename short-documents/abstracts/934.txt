    The following thesis began as an investigation into post-industrial urban waste and the ecological remediation potential that such landscapes embody. It looks at the forces behind waste landscapes or drosscapes and examines the theories associated with the ever-growing amount of waste landscapes throughout our cities. This thesis is largely centered on using Landscape Urbanism as a means of regenerating post-industrial waste sites. The Landscape Urbanists have proposed the use of landscape, rather than architecture, to transform urban waste and reconnect it back to the urban fabric. Where does architecture exist within this context? How can architecture act as a catalyst throughout this transformation? This thesis will examine how architecture and landscape can operate in unison throughout post-industrial site remediation and it will explore how built form can become an integral part of a continuous landscape.
