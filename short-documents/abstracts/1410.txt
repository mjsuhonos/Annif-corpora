    This secondary data analysis examined the extent to which fatigue mediates the relationship between insomnia and the physical, social, and psychological domains of functional status in community-dwelling older adults. Data were obtained from 209 older adults with insomnia. Regression analysis was used to test the proposed mediating role of fatigue. Findings identified insomnia of moderate severity in community-dwelling older adults. Insomnia was directly associated with social function and indirectly associated with physical and psychological function. Fatigue mediated the relationship between insomnia and all three domains of functional status. The findings highlight the importance of successfully managing insomnia and fatigue to promote functioning in older adults.
