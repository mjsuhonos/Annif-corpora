Scrap tire stockpiles are havens for pests and mosquitoes; thereby this poses a potential health risk. This research work was carried out in six stages to determine the use of scrap tire materials in trickling filter system to treat landfill leachate; 81 to 96% BOD₅, 76 to 90% COD and 15 to 68% NH₃-N from leachate were removed. Organic removal appears to be largely related with total dissolved solids reduction from leachate. Sudden increase in organic content of effluent from time to time could be attributed to biomass sloughing and clogging in trickling filters. However, tire crumbs exhibited more consistent organic removal through out the experiment. Because of high surface area of tire materials, a thick layer of biomass was attached on them and sloughed off at an interval of 21 days. Further research and practical applications are needed to establish usefulness of tire materials in this field.
