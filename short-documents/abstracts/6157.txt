This study finds out how South Asian immigrant parents conceptualize, negotiate and develop their relationship with their children's schools. The qualitative analysis of interview data collected from nine newcomer parents provides an insight into the processes involved in conceptualizing, developing and negotiating parent-school relationships. This study is important as current trends in immigration reveal that the South Asian population is the largest visible minority group in Canada. Findings show that most immigrant parents are heavily invested in their children's education and go to great lengths to become acquainted with the new system they encounter. Implications for including immigrant parents in their childrenâ€™s education are discussed.
