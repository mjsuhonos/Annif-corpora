    This paper explores the labour market experiences of Government Assisted Refugees (GARs) in Canada by utilizing social capital theory and identifies the areas for future research. Data was collected from an in-depth literature review but very little literatures are available to measure the labour market experiences of GARs specifically. The lack of research is particularly prominent in the area of GARsâ€™ economic outcomes and earnings through social capital framework. Changes to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) in 2002 have shifted the selection of GARs which has implication for their economic integration once in Canada. The results of this paper indicate that social capital is a significant component in impacting labour market integration of GARs because of the loss of academic, occupational and other forms of human capital.
