    Aquatic environments have long been used as disposal sites for domestic and industrial wastes, resulting in increasing chemical contamination, decreased water quality, and concern for ecosystem health and drinking water sources. This study utilized bioassays, the "golden standard" method to measure biological impact, to assess the toxicity of the widely found surface water contaminant, the antimicrobial triclocarban. Culturing protocols were implemented to provide healthy, age-synchronized organisms for bioassays. Behaviour and reproduction were demonstrated as useful endpoints while refining these methods using 4-chlorophenol and were successfully implemented in the toxicity assessment of triclocarban. While no sub-lethal behavioural impact was seen, 10.0 ppb triclocarban was found to delay reproduction in Daphnia magna. This delay could result in population, community, and ecosystem-level responses.
