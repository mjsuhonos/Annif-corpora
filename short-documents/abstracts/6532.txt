The Temagami wilderness that we know today is the result of both a cultural and natural phenomenon; the result of a struggle over meaning, identity and land. This paper explores how histories and cultures are reflected in the physical and social landscape of recreational space in Ontario. The primary research question surrounds who has access to Temagami and whose voices are represented. The focus is largely on First Nations visibility and inclusion in Temagami, navigating land use tensions between recreational users, resource extraction, and the Teme-Augama Anishnabai. Merging discourse on wilderness as Canadian identity, settler colonialism, and decolonization, this paper explores the contested nature of the wilderness and identifies opportunities for coexistence and a shared future of mutual respect. This research will contribute to our understanding of cottage country - a unique Ontario identity - reflecting on how First Nationsâ€™ identity and values can be represented equally alongside settler society. The goal of this work is to contribute to the discussion on opportunities for decolonization of our wilderness landscapes.
