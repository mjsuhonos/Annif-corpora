This study attempts to identify some best practices for developing and delivering business proposals in different cross-cultural environments. Interviewing seven international business people, analyzing proposal documents and reviewing
relevant literature has resulted in the discovery of some commonalities in the proposal process, which do not line up with theoretical assertions in all cases. Findings suggest that business people appeal to potential clients and partners
through methods of cultural and linguistic accommodation, and these strategies emerge informally through personal experience.
