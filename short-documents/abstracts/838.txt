    This major research paper examines a unique group of Filipina nurses of the 1960s in Canada's immigration history. First, the conditions that encouraged the migration of Filipino professionals from the Philippines after World War Two are discussed. Second, the public and private sector maneuverings that facilitated the nurses' transportation to Canada are revealed. Third, the factors and experiences that resulted in the women's successful integration into mainstream rural Canada are explored. The achievement of Filipina nurses is indicative of a model example of social and professional integration into Canadian society.
