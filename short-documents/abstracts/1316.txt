    This thesis project used a collection of 59 celluloid photographic buttons as a case study for arranging, describing, and cataloging similar novelty displays. The buttons discussed, which are part of the photographic collection at Eastman House, are in the form of pin-backs, pocket mirrors, and medallions. The first part of the paper describes the collection, gives a concise explanation of the button-making process and history, and presents an analysis of celluloid buttons based on observations of the objects as well as primary research. The second part of the paper outlines the arrangement and cataloging process, and summarized the decisions made regarding the documentation of the collection.
