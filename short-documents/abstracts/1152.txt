    The Baby Boomer generation has exerted significant influence within Canadian society. This power will continue to strengthen as Baby Boomers will redefine their lives in their golden years. The sheer volume of this generation has continuously affected economic and political clout, which constantly alters society. The current model of traditional institutional care, which keeps the elderly apart from their community to receive additional healthcare, will no longer be a suitable option for the Baby Boomers. As such, an investigation into an alternative solution for senior living is needed in order to provide an adequate environment to support this powerful and diverse elderly Baby boomer generation. This thesis establishes architectural strategies that address the fundamental theory that encourages ageing in a place within the community, allowing for a "society for all ages." This thesis also identifies how architecture can reduce the reliance of formal care through providing social connectivity within an intergenerational setting, which promotes independence and community support. The result is an architectural exploration reinterpreting the way we design for the ageing Baby Boomer population by creating unique spatial relationships that provide the opportunity for the community to engage in social activities.
