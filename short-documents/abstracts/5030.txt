In this thesis, a history-based energy-efficient routing protocol (called AEHBPR) for opportunistic networks (OppNets) is proposed, which saves the energy consumption by avoiding unnecessary packets transmission in the network and by clearing the buffer of nodes carrying the copies of the already delivered packets. The proposed AEHBPR protocol is evaluated using the Opportunistic NEtwork (ONE) simulator with both synthetic and real mobility traces, showing a superior performance compared to the History-Based Prediction for Routing (HBPR) protocol and AEProphet, in terms of average remaining energy, number of dead nodes, number of delivered messages, and overhead ratio, where AEProphet is the ProPHet routing protocol for OppNets on which the same energy-aware mechanism has been implemented.
