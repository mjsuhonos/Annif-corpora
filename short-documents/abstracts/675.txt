    his study investigates the applicability of fuzzy logic control to high-frame rate stereovision object tracking. The technology developed in this work is based on utilizing a disparity map produced by the Stereovision Tracking System (STS) to identify the object of interest. The coordinates of the object are used by the fuzzy logic control system to provide rotation and focus control for object tracking. The fuzzy logic control was realized as a reconfigurable hardware module and implemented on Virtex-2 FPGA platform of the STS. The fuzzy reasoning was implemented as a reconfigurable look-up table residing in FPGA's internal memory. A set of software tools facilitating creation of loop-up table and reconfiguration of fuzzy logic control system was developed. Finally, the experimental prototype of the system was built and tested.
