Web-based Public Participation Geographic Information System (WebPPGIS) is inherently about empowering GIS and Web technology and enabling the public users to use the technology to capture their local knowledge and immerse them into the spatial decision making process. However, there have [sic] some common barriers to WebPPGIS implementation such as lack of communication mechanism for the public; lack of friendly use interface for the non-expert public users; and the cost of the GIS software packages etc. 
  This thesis presents the results of a research project, aiming at overcoming the above barriers and implementing a practical WebPPGIS. General requirements of WebPPGIS are summarized based on the analysis of current researches and a prototype is implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. Also this thesis illustrates that Open Source Software (OSS) is a competetive solution for developing cost-effective WebPPGIS. Further, the evaluation of the prototype has been performed against the requirements
