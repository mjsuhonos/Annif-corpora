    This paper argues the possession of formal education is essential for successful settlement in a western country. Using the Somali Bantu resettlement experience as a case study, this paper highlights the extent to which a lack of basic information can hamper a smooth transition into a western community. It is contended that a long history of social exclusion and intentional discrimination and abuse of the Somali Bantu resulted in their state of illiteracy and or lack of pre-literacy skills, which made their resettlement experience that much more difficult than usual. I will seek to support my argument by use of narrations and case studies obtained from refugee supporting agencies and settlement providing organization reports and the media.
