    This thesis introduces a novel approach to rapid Design Space Exploration (DSE) and presents a formalized High Level Synthesis (HLS) design flow with multi parametric optimization issues related to DSE such as the precision of evaluation, time exhausted during evaluation and also automation of the exploration process. During DSE a conflicting situation always exists for the designer to concurrently maximize the accuracy of the exploration process and minimize the time spent during DSE analysis. This technique is capable of drastically reducing the number of architectural variants to be analyzed for accurate selection of the optimal design point in a short time. The DSE results for many benchmarks are presented along with a comparison to an existing DSE approach that uses the hierarchical structure method for architecture evaluation. Results indicated significant improvement in speedup compared to the current existing approach.
