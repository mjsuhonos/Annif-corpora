    Long-term records of the abundance of organisms are needed to detect more progressive changes in their populations as a result of external stressors. Long-term changes in historical Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) population abundance were identified in the Humber River, Rouge River and Duffins Creek watersheds in Ontario through statistical analysis of twenty-six years of sampling records. Corresponding historical changes in air and stream water temperature, and in land cover were also examined. Changes detected in climate parameters, and in land cover were then related to Brook Trout population changes. Results revealed that Brook Trout abundance had decreased significantly. These changes were driven by populations in the Humber and Rouge River watersheds. Populations in the Duffins Creek watershed did not change significantly. Climate parameters did change but not significantly over time in the region. However, land cover changes were observed. In the short term, Brook Trout population changes were more likely due to changes in land cover than climate.
