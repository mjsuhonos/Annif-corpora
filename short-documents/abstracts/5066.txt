Since their discovery, immense attention has been given to carbon nanotubes (CNTs), due to their exceptional thermal, electronic and mechanical properties and, therefore, the wide range of applications in which they are, or can be potentially, employed. Hence, it is important that all the properties of carbon nanotubes are studied extensively.

This thesis studies the vibrational frequencies of double-walled and triple-walled CNTs, with and without an elastic medium surrounding them, by using Finite Element Method (FEM) and Dynamic Stiffness Matrix (DSM) formulations, considering them as Euler-Bernoulli beams coupled with van der Waals interaction forces.

For FEM modelling, the linear eigenvalue problem is obtained using Galerkin weighted residual approach. The natural frequencies and mode shapes are derived from eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively. For DSM formulation of double-walled CNTs, a nonlinear eigenvalue problem is obtained by enforcing displacement and load end conditions to the exact solution of single equation achieved by combining the coupled governing equations. The natural frequencies are obtained using Wittrick-Williams algorithm. FEM formulation is also applied to both double and triple-walled CNTs modelled as nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam. The natural frequencies obtained for all the cases, are in agreement with the values provided in literature.
