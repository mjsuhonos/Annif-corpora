With emerging concerns over climate change and the need for reduced greenhouse gas emissions, together with the growing awareness of the importance of the natural environment and the depletion of the earth's non-renewable energy resources, the generation of electricity from distributed renewable energy resource such as solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy has begun to expand at a rapid pace. Proliferation of convert-based distributed energy resources in distribution systems has introduced new challenges in determining the maximum possible fault currents that a power system must be able to withstand without being compromised.  Therefore is is imperative to develop the mathematical and software simulation models that approximate the response of converter-based distributed energy resources during a fault on the transmission or distribution system in order to determine the fault current contributions to the electrical grid that a transmission or distribution utility needs to reflect in their connection impact assessments.
