In response to the growing supply of postsecondary education graduates and the persistence of overqualification in the Canadian labour market, this study investigates the relationship between the levels of job-education match and tenure among young workers, 25 to 34 years of age, relative to the remaining workforce ages 35 to 64, using a job analysis (JA) approach based on skill levels defined by the National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2011 and education credentials defined by Statistics Canada. Using the 1997 and 2014 Labour Force Survey (LFS) files, a significant negative relationship is observed between length of tenure and overqualified workers, and a significant positive relationship with underqualified workers, in addition to significant differences in the effect that being over/underqualified has on tenure based on respondentsâ€™ age and survey year. Implications for individual, organizational, and societal stakeholders involved in the school-to-work transition are discussed.
