The C9 Fred Davis and Yvonne Leroux Fonds at the Archives of Ontario is comprised of textual and photographic materials that primarily document the 1930's Canadian phenomenon, the Dionne Quintuplets; Davis was their official photographer and Leroux, was their nurse.  This Fonds, although important to Canadian history, had a similar fate to many archivally held collections, in that improper processing made the collection challenging to discover and navigate through.  This applied thesis discusses the literature research, and overall development and creation of a finding aid.  It also examines the development of a current finding aid completed to the Archives of Ontario's standards, which logically organized the collection and links the material physically and intellectually.
