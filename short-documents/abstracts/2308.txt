    Power control is one of the most important processes in cellular CDMA networks as the interference is the predominant factor that influences the capacity and signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR). In mobile communication, minimizing the mobile transmitted power subject to maintaining the link quality is a challenging task. In this thesis, a pilot based power control (PPBPC) algorithm integrated with base station assignment is proposed which is decentralized, uses transmit power control and adapts cell sizes for load distribution.     In the proposed algorithm, each base station transmits its forward link pilot power inversely proportional to the total reverse link received power. The mobile station senses the strongest pilot power received and determines its home base station. Using the proposed algorithm, dynamic propogation of base station assignment occurs which leads to re-assignment of home base stations system-wide reducing the total mobile transmit power. The simulation results are the evidence for the feasibility of the implementation of the algorithm.
