Cellular based M2M systems generate massive number of access requests which create congestion in the cellular network. The contention-based random access procedures are designed for cellular networks which cannot accommodate a large number of M2M traffic. Moreover, M2M systems share same radio resources with cellular users. Resource allocation problem becomes a challenging issue in cellular M2M systems. In this thesis, we address these two problems by analyzing a contention-based slotted Aloha random access procedure for M2M networks using different performance metrics. The impact of massive M2M traffic over cellular traffic is studied based on different arrival rate, random access opportunity and throughput. An analytical model of selecting a base station (eNB) along with load balancing is developed. Finally, two methods have been presented and evaluated with M2M traffic. First one is dynamic access class barring method which controls RAN level congestion by selecting an appropriate eNB and applying load balancing method. Second one is relay-assisted radio resource allocation method which maximizes the sum throughput of the system by utilizing the available radio resource blocks and relay nodes to the MTC systems. Numerical results show that frame transmission rate influences the selection probability of the base stations. Moreover, the dynamic access class barring parameter along with frame transmission rate improve the overall throughput and access success probability among base stations as well as avoid overload situation in a particular base station.
