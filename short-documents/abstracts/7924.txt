There is a need to evolve the current collective praxis for providing assessment and feedback on
creative projects within fashion and related domains in higher education (HE) programs. Rapid
advancements and disruption taking place within fashion and related creative industries signal a
need for graduates who can think more divergently, while the increased diversity among current
and future cohorts in HE who have different learning requirements, along with faculty facing
increased time constraints and limitations in their work processes, call for new methods for
providing assessment and feedback efficiently and effectively. This study proposes a practical
prototype of a mobile technological solution that could help to contemporize current praxis, and
may contribute to the emerging field of research: Mobile-Based Assessment (MBA).
