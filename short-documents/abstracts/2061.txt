    In this study, we presented an integrated approach to the design of digital filters using the digital filter package (DFP). We added four new features to DFP: multi-band filter design, adaptive filter design, two-dimensional filter design and TMS320 code generation. We discuss each of these new features from design consideration to realization. We present design examples and demonstrate the design results generated by DFP. We also discuss GUI design in MATLAB, the DFP GUI design structure and the data transition structure from one DFP function to another. We show that DFP can allow efficient design of the flollowing filter structures: low pass filter, high pass filter, band pass filter, band stop filter, multi band filter, differentiator, Hilbert Transformer, adaptive and 2D filters. DFP allows the use of a variety of FIR and IIR design methods as well as hardware implementation structures; it provides a useful tool to quickly examine a variety of filters and understand the trade-offs involved in varying the characteristics of the filter.
