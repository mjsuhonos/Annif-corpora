The ability to accurately determine in-service deterioration of concrete remains an important facet of research. This research aims to develop more reliable laboratory testing methods to better replicate in-service conditions. Two concrete deterioration modes were studied; Salt Scaling (SS) and Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR). For SS, wrapping slabs in plastic was adopted to provide the same curing environment as curing compound for comparison to standard moist curing. Slabs with and without supplementary cementing materials were tested. The two curing methods produced
different scaling results; however, results of tested samples did not change in terms of meeting or failing the acceptance limit. For ASR, modified tests focused on changing sample size to attempt to reduce alkali leaching during testing, and hence produce results that mimic long term performance of actual structures. Cube moulds were designed, manufactured, and used rather than standard prisms. Increase of specimen dimension appear to reduce leaching at 38Â°C.
