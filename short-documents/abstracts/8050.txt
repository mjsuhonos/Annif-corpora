Inclusive design is an approach to design that puts the diversity of people at the centre of its focus. By following this approach, designers can help users avoid unnecessary barriers and frustrations that lead them to feel excluded from the product or service. This study uses this approach to examine whether current popular dating applications such as Tinder, Bumble, and Grindr create barriers for their users especially those who  identify as People of Colour and people who identify as transgender, non-binary, genderqueer, gender non-conforming or any other gender identity existing outside of the traditional female-male binary. By listening and using empathy to put these users at the centre of the design process, my objective is to build a dating app that will meet their needs, reduce unconscious bias, and create a safe and equitable experience for everyone.
