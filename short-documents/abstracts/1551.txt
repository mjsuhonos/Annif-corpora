    This qualitative and exploratory research project focuses on the way in which culturally appropriate care is being provided to older immigrants in ethno-specific longterm care settings in the Greater Toronto Area. Key Informant interviews with administrators of ethno-specific long-term care facilities were utilized in order to gather data on best practices and lessons learned for addressing the cultural needs of older immigrants living in long-term care. The research findings reinforce the need for ethnospecific long-term care programs, as well as culturally sensitive care in all programs, which alleviate the environmental stressors of institutional care and aging. Research recommendations point to a need for greater knowledge sharing within the long-term care sector, as well as increased education to service providers as to the historical context of the immigration and life experiences of ethno-specific groups in care. As well, there is a need for a shift in design of long-term care that addresses systemic issues of inequality that restrict how cultural care is delivered.Multiculturalism.
