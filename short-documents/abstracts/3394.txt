This research paper provides insight into the experiences and challenges that asylum seekers go through in their quest to obtain legal status in countries in the West. Even though countries like Canada, the US, UK and Australia are signatories to the 1951 Refugee Convention, this paper attempts to show that these countries are not adhering to the principles of the Convention when it comes to the issues of those labelled as asylum seekers or refugees. My paper focuses specifically on the challenges and the experiences that those with these labels go through, from the ways employed into the attempts to negotiate borders to ways that will provide a favorable outcome from the Immigration and Refugee Board.  Further, the study strives to highlight that governments of the West are violating the mobility rights of refugees and asylum seekers in favor of corporations and the free movement of goods.
