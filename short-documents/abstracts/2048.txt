    We are investigating the feasibility of binary coded excitation methods using Golay code pairs for high frequency ultrasound imaging as a way to increase the signal to noise ratio. I present some theoretical models used to simulate the coded excitation method and results generated from the models. A new coded excitation high frequency ultrasound prototype system was built to verify the simulation results. Both the simulation and the experimental results show that binary coded excitation can improve the signal to noise ratio in high frequency ultrasound backscatter signals. These results are confirmed in phantoms and excised bovine liver. If just white noise is considered, the encoding gain is 15dB for a Golay pair of length 4. We find the system to be very sensitive to motion (i.e. phase shift) and frequency dependent (FD) attenuation, creating sidelobes and degrading axial resolution and encoding gain. Methods to address these issues are discussed.
