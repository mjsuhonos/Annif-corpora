Young-adult and parent relationships are widely examined throughout the literature. However, there has been very little focus on youth's perspective on the relationships with their parents and families. While, there is a combination of both conflict and solidarity in immigrant families, in my work, I will be looking at the intergenerational solidarity between youth and their parents, from the perspective of young people. This study is exploratory and qualitative, and aims to contribute to the research on immigrant Filipino families in the Canadian context. This study found positive views by the youth about their relationship with their parents. Parental expectations and obligations in family matters such as school and career aspirations were deemed important by the youth participants. Despite some disagreements on issues, such as dating and career choices, the youth reported agreement with their parents on family values such as respect and obligation to the family.
