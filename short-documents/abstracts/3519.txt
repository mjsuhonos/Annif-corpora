The process of making steel from the scrap metal by means of electric arc furnaces (EAF) has been used extensively in the industry. Accurate modelling of EAFs is, therefore, desired to assess their operations and their impacts on the electrical network. A number of approaches have already been used to model the v-i behavior of electric arc furnaces including mathematical methods and data-driven models. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the data-driven modelling methodologies, in particular, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). The results obtained show that the proposed method with radial base function kernel provides the model to predict both arc current and arc voltage of EAFs.
