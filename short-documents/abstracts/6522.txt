This paper details an institutional ethnography conducted in Constance Lake First Nation, a rural
Oji-Cree community in northern Ontario, Canada. The study is a part of a larger project called
the Inclusive Early Childhood Service System Project, which is partnered with several
municipalities and service organizations in four communities across Ontario. The current project
examined six family narratives of accessing disability support services for young children. The
project seeks to understand how the service system functions from the perspective of families,
and the impact of institutional interactions on families within the service system. Employing
critical disability theory and Indigenous perspectives of child development, the study seeks to
develop a culturally-based conceptualization of disability support for Indigenous children with
disabilities or gifts.
