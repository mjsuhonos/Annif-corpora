This study is performed on pressuremeter tests (PMT) in glacial tills based on comprehensive geotechnical investigation programs for a light rail transit project in the City of Toronto. The main objectives are to establish a correlation between SPT-N values and PMT parameters, and the Menard “α” factors for glacial tills. Currently, there are no such relationships available. So first, the pairs of PMT data and SPT-N values are collected at the same depth and test area. With these paired data, two linear correlation equations are established. Then, the numerical simulation is performed for PMTs in glacial tills by using finite element software, Plaxis 2D. The Mohr-Coulomb material model is used to model the different types of soil. The Menard “α” factor is suggested based on the best match between numerical prediction and field PMT. Ranges of SPT-N, EPMT and PL are also suggested for glacial tills.
