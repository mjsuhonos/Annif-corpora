Toronto, with half of its population born outside of Canada and speaking more than 140 languages, is well known
as one of the most multicultural cities in the world. Its ethno-cultural diversity is often manifested in urban
landscapes with long-lasting imprints of ethnic-oriented facilities and institutions. With increasing
suburbanization of immigrant populations, ethnic neighbourhoods have speckled the suburban landscapes. The
stereotypically homogeneous suburban landscapes have been transformed by ethnic communities who bring new
identities and new meanings to the space. What has become imperative for suburban municipalities to understand
is how these ethnic neighbourhoods have emerged and evolved, how ethnic communities have played a role in
suburban place-making, and more importantly, what municipal planning interventions (e.g., planning policies and
processes) are appropriate and effective to enhance the advantages of urban diversity and manage unprecedented
social, cultural, economic, physical, and political changes that challenge conventional suburban planning. This
documentary explores the increasing diversity in Torontoâ€™s suburbs and the place-making challenges and
opportunities. The research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.
