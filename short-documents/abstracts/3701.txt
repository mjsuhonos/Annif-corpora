In this paper, a novel algorithm based on hash function for image cryptography is proposed. In this algorithm, the key idea is to encrypt half of the image using data from the second half of the image and then apply it to each other. This scheme can achieve high sensitivity, high complexity, and high security. The sole purpose is to improve the image entropy.
