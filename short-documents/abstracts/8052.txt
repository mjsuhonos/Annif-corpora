Virtual reality can be used to tell stories in ways that humans have never before experienced.
Why doesn’t the display of virtual reality content reflect it’s immersive nature? Could the development of a spatial design and entrance/exit protocols allow for people to have more enticing experiences with this evolving medium? This MRP explores the reasons that have held back growth for virtual reality narrative experiences and displays. Through research, by observation of public virtual reality spaces and interviews of the operators of virtual reality experience centres, I have explored various sets of best practices. I culled together the best practices from each resource to create a physical virtual reality cinema where I could test and refine my findings.
