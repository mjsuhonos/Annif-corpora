    The mealtime experiences for people with dementia and their caregivers living in the community has not been extensively explored. An existing data set provided information on the mealtime strategies used to cope with changing dementia behaviours. A secondary analysis of data from 10 dyads of people with dementia and their caregivers were analyzed. Four categories were identified including: Strategies to facilitate eating; Strategies to promote a sense of self; Stategies to minimize risk; and Strategies to promote caregiver well-being. The dyads used a variety of strategies that were common to all stages of dementia; however by the late stages, the dyads used more specific strategies. In general, the mealtime strategies used by adult caregivers and spousal caregivers did not greatly differ but rather the context in which they engaged in mealtimes did. The results demonstrated that there are opportunities to educate families and professionals about potential mealtime strategies.
