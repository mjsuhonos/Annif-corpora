In order to investigate gestural behavior during human-computer interactions, an investigation into the
designs of current interaction methods is conducted. This information is then compared to current
emerging databases to observe if the gesture designs follow guidelines discovered in the above
investigation. The comparison will also observe common trends in the currently developed gesture
databases such as similar gesture for specific commands. In order to investigate gestural behavior
during interactions with computer interfaces, an experiment has been devised to observe and record
gestures in use for gesture databases through the use of a hardware sensor device. It was discovered
that factors such as opposing adjacent fingers and gestures that simulated object manipulation are
factors in user comfort. The results of this study will create guidelines for creating new gestures for
hand gesture interfaces.
