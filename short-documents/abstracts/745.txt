    A business process model is an abstraction of business funcionality in terms of modeling the goals, processes, objects and any other associated events of an enterprise. An effective business model can show how an enterprise and its subsets function today, and how one may plan for it to function in the future. Effective business modeling to gain insights towards improvements in hospital areas has been used infrequently by industrial engineers. This thesis presents a methodology using UML (Unified Modeling language) and SADT (Structured Analysis & Design Technique) that may be utilized to develop an effective business process model in the medical imaging area of a major Canadian hospital (St. Michael's Hospital). The effectiveness of this business model may clear the way towards a comprehensive analysis for improvements.
