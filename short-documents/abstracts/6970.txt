Architecture and architectural drawings typically focus on known parameters – known programs, events, location, materials, known experiences. A House of Three Birds* grapples with how to draw the unknown, the sublime, the liminal – the ineffable experience of architecture. Normative architectural drawings rely on creating what we see using conventions that allow for a clear understanding of their desired outcome, providing little interpretation of the author’s meaning and intent. This design research focuses on providing a method of translation that engages the viewer within the space of the drawing, encouraging the drawing to become more than what is shown. No longer static, the drawing becomes a dynamic entity, generating and proliferating unexplored outcomes. This design research oscillates between the act and product of drawing to develop a series of experimental plots where one is not told how to participate, but is instead, inventing ways to participate.
