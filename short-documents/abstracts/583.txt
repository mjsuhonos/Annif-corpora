    With the proliferation of international movement that has accompanied globalization, tourism is fueling a significant part of the demand for the consumption of sex, including the exploitation of children. The sexual exploitation of children has taken a transnational dynamic as consumers or perpetrators travel to specific international destinations with easier access to children for the purposes of sex. By looking in particular at the migratory phenomenon of the international travel of Canadians to countries in the global South and their engagement with the sexual exploitation of children, this paper will outline the need for further research and public awareness of Canadian contributions to these crimes overseas and highlight ways in which Canada has and can further honour its commitments to the protection [of] children's rights.
