    The purpose of this thesis is the development of options for the reduction of the carbon footprint at an electric utility company. A case study details a systematic approach to reduce corporate greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade. The study focuses on providing three principle outputs: 1) process maps whereby the company may systematically identify its current carbon footprint, 2) scenario analyses to project its future carbon emissions over a ten year period and, 3) recommended actions to reduce GHG emissions over the next decade. A number of recommendations for emission reductions are made. The findings suggest that the degree to which an organization addresses its GHG emissions is substantially influenced by organization-specific social, regulatory, technological and economic forces. The case study reveals that by perceiving corporate carbon management as a periphery objective, organizations limit their ability to reduce GHG emissions and to improve their corporate performance.
