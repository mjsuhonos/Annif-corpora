    Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is a maintenance strategy that reduces equipment downtime, production loss, and maintenance cost based on the changes in machine condition (e.g., changes in vibration, power usage, operating performance, temperatures, noise levels, chemical composition, and debris content). A newly developed condition monitoring model (CMM) is developed based on Bayesian decision theory, which takes vibration signals from a rotating machine and classifies them to either the normal or abnormal state. A conditional risk function is defined, which is calculated based on a loss table and the posterior probabilities. Using the conditional risk funciton, the machine condition can be classified to either the normal or abnormal condition. The developed model can efficiently avoid unnecessary maintenance and take timely actions through analyzing the received vibration signals from the machine. However, the vibration signals sometimes may not be sensed, transmitted, or received precisely due to unexpected situations. Therefore, a fuzzy Bayesian model for condition monitoring of a system is proposed. A program is coded in visual basic to run the models. Illustrative examples are demonstrated to present the application of both models.
