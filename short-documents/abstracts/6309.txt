Over the years the development approval process in Jamaica has been criticised by its major stakeholders as being inefficient and costly.  It was also seen as a major disincentive in promoting and attracting investment in the Island.  In response to the criticisms and investment concerns, successive governments have implemented reforms to improve the process.  The purpose of this research is to use the subdivision process in Kingston and St. Andrew as a case study to evaluate the development approval process given these changes, to see if the process has improved.  The research uses a mixed method approach to evaluate the process with respect to its effectiveness.
The report concludes that the process has improved but is still not meeting the mandated 90 day timeline.  The report finishes by making recommendations on how the system can be improved and reformed to meet these time lines.
