This study explores both existing research as well as emerging themes in the area of Tibetan exile communities.  Previous research examining the settlement experiences of Tibetan refugees in Europe, the United States and India has focused largely on the various ways in which individuals acculturate and adapt to new, culturally different environments.  Out of this research, a number of themes arise such as cultural expectations, internal concepts of identity, and citizenship.  Authors have suggested that Tibetan refugees during settlement are likely to adopt a version of Berryâ€™s integration strategy of acculturation.  What is lacking in these earlier studies is an exploration of the experiences of Tibetan refugees in Canada.  This study is set within a Canadian context and considers other social factors that may greatly influence the settlement experience, namely barriers to settlement such as the failure to have foreign credentials recognized.  Key words: Tibetan, Refugees, Settlement, Acculturation, Cultural Identity.
