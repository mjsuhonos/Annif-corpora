A su propio ritmo (At Its Own Rhythm) is a short documentary film that reinterprets the audiovisual legacy of the Cuban Revolution, as seen through the lens of the Noticiero ICAIC Latinoamericano (ICAIC Latin American Newsreel). In this paper, I examine the socio-historical context of the Noticiero, present my methodological motivations, the theories that have illuminated my artistic process in the construction of the film, and situate it within documentary film practice at large.
