    This thesis presents a descriptive phenomenological inquiry of the lived experience of correctional nursing in a Canadian context. Seven in-depth interviews with correctional nurses were conducted. Data analysis was guided by Giorgi's description of the descriptive phenomenological psychological method. Fourteen essential structures were identified. These essential structures described participants' experiences related to: discovering correctional nursing: their physical workspaces; their working relationships; and caring for inmate clients. Implications for policy and administration include suggestions for reviewing the service delivery model of healthcare services within corrections and improving the recruitment and retention of correctional nurses. Implications for nursing practice, education, and research are also discussed.
