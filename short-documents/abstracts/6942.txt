Research examining contaminant sequestration using engineered wetlands has been
conducted for many years but the implementation of sustainable, biodiverse strategies is still in
its infancy. A major gap in knowledge still exists regarding the kinds of macrophytes to be
selected, especially the inclusion of non-invasive native flora. There is a lack of information
about macrophyte selection criteria and germination protocols. Thus, this study attempted to
redress this dearth in knowledge. The first part of this thesis critically assessed a list of
macrophytes provided by Environment Canada (1996) and created “selection criteria” for
choosing specific macrophytes. Germination protocols were then compiled to determine and
outline optimized germination protocols for these aquatic macrophytes.

In the second part of this study, two different constructed wetlands models were designed
for laboratory purposes (a “floating” constructed wetland model and a “stationary” constructed
wetland model). Water samples were assed for biological impact and phosphorus concentration.
