Depleting fossil fuels and heavy reliance on such energy sources for production of construction materials can render a great deal of disorder in the near future for the architectural, engineering and construction industries. The ideal resource management methods are currently in trial stage, and as much as ‘cradle to cradle’ or ‘closed cycle loop’ are achievable they will have to be accompanied by a different mindset from the designer’s standpoint. Design with reused or superused materials requires a means-oriented approach. With such high levels of residential post construction and demolition waste lies a great opportunity for their direct application (with minor processing), which is currently highly underutilized. Shortcircuiting the material flow and its possibilities for reuse or superuse may lead to a different kind of aesthetics that this thesis seeks to explore.
