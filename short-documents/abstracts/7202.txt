It was not until recent years that I noticed something curious about my family. That maybe the years of on going feuding and disappointment were not solely due to our conflicting personalities, and that there were other external, cultural and societal forces at play. When I began my MFA, I had no idea I was going to create a project about my own family – that I would be projecting giant portraits of my mother and father’s face on gallery walls. But, over the last two years, the deep-seeded troubles my family ignored for as long as I can remember bubbled to the surface. Just as the chaos began to unfold, I started my MFA, trying to figure out what story I wanted to share with the world. It turned out that our story would be the one to tell. If there is one thing I am sure of, this story would not have been discussed and shared with the public, if it wasn’t for the deep and unconditional love and trust we possess for one another.
