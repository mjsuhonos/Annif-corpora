    Bluetooth technology aims at allowing short-range communication between portable and/or fixed devices. It uses short-range radio links to replace cables between Bluetooth-enabled devices. In this way, it is similar in purpose to the Infrared Data Association (IrDA), however, Bluetooth is a radio frequency (RF) technology utilizing the unlicensed 2.5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. The key features of Bluetooth technology are robustness, low power and low cost with its primary market for data and voice transfer between communication devices and PCs.
    In this project, a simulation study is done with three major goals in mind: (i) to gather expertise on and evaluate a Bluetooth simulation tool called Bluehoc for further use, (ii) to gather measurements of some Bluetooth characteristics such as throughput in post connection state and (ii) to describe a model that can be used to get maximum throughput for voice and data applications. We also review some of the key aspects in Bluetooth simulation and present models of the Bluetooth devices to get maximum throughput. We show that user data transfer rate (throughput) between Bluetooth master and slaves is effected by distance, number of slaves and slave's start time.
