    There is an increasing demand for reliable communications systems in underground mines and tunnels. This is especially true when these systems need to ensure the safety of personnel involved in the mining operations and also to provide infrastructure for mine's communication networks. Stability problems are among the challenges of providing reliable communications in the underground mines. This thesis has focused on analyzing the stability problems in the communication systems of leaky cable technology. Novel algorithms have been developed to provide Automatic Gain and Slope Controls for the leaky feeder communication systems in the underground mines. The new algorithms are based on predications. The amplifiers in the system cascade will be able to predict and compensate for losses yet to occur in the system. System stability will be improved as a result of applying these algorithms by controlling the gains and the slopes of the amplifiers in the systems.
