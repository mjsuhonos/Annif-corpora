    This study attempts to explore and restory the early experiences of a man who grew up with a non-mainstream sexual identity. Young children may be exploring non-mainstream gender and sexual identities. Resources should be in place to support these children, both at home and in school. By identifying gender and sex as constructs, heteronormative assumptions on appropriate behaviour are challenged and similarly deconstructed. Disempowerment is illuminated throughout this narrative and information provided by civil rights groups, school boards and prominent researchers are woven with the participant's thoughts, his early boards and prominent researchers are woven with the participant's thoughts, his early experiences and recommendations for the future. A narrative research design was used to develop my participant's personal story. Multiple methods of data collection were employed and individual voice was honoured. Full participation was encouraged whereby the participant made suggestions on how to improve the research process and the overall strength of his story. Additionally, as a teacher, the participant has shared his experiences and advice on including children with non-mainstream sexualities in the classroom. By exploring the narrativers of an adult who has experienced invisibility and marginality as a child, I hope to increase our understanding of the importance of supporting young children with non-mainstream sexual and gender identities and the detrimental effect that the lack of support can have upon young children's formation of identity.
