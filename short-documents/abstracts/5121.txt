The production of food, its delivery to markets, and its use by consumers depends on the proper functioning of numerous supply chains and critical infrastructure networks, many of which are threatened by a changing climate. To ensure the proper functioning of food supply chains during weather-related catastrophes, climate change adaptation and food security plans must consider risks to all elements of the chain and identify strategies for bolstering resilience. This paper explores the efforts of various North American cities to respond to this challenge and offers recommendations for improving food supply chain resilience in Toronto, Ontario.
