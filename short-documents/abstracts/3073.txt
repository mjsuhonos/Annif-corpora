Minecraft, the popular video game, shows promise as a planning engagement tool: it allows players to experience and manipulate a three-dimensional environment, it is easy to learn and understand, it is engaging and immersive, it is adaptable, and it has already begun to be used for geodesign and planning engagement. However, this game has not yet been studied to determine how it could best be used for this purpose. Using an analysis of key informant interviews, this study seeks to address this deficit and reflect on the ways in which this game could help planners achieve various engagement goals. Key findings in this study address Minecraftâ€™s usefulness as a visualization tool, its role in building trust, the place of play in planning, and the challenges associated with conducting an accessible, interactive online engagement using Minecraft.
