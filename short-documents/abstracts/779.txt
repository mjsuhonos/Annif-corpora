    The purpose of this study was to conduct an assessment of Allan Gardens' urban forest and to investigate the value of environmental and aesthetic benefits it provides the City of Toronto. This project used the Street Tree Resource Analysis Tool for Urban Forest Managers (STRATUM) model to assess forest structure, function, and monetary value of benefits. Soil in Allan Gardens was also investigated to determine the growing conditions for park trees. Results indicate that Allan Gardens maintained 309 trees that provide $60,407 annually in net annual environmental and property value benefits to the City of Toronto. Soil conditions in the park were found to be highly variable, where some locations were highly compacted and may be restricting tree root growth. To sustain and enhance these benefits in the future, Toronto's urban forest requires dedicated management and maintenance that includes new plantings, but prioritized protection and maintenance of existing trees and soil.
