    A computer simulation was developed to predict the evolution of abrasive jet machined surfaces in unmasked substrates. Interference effects were included in the model by tracking individual particles and their collisions. The model was capable of investigating the effect of various parameters such as launch frequency, abrasive particle size and material and substrate material on the shape and size of the erosion profile, as a function of time. The model is also able to examine the effect of these parameters and the instantaneous shape of the profile on the particle interference patterns. The model was verified, for the case of a flat non eroding surface, against an existing computer simulation of particle interference effects. The predictions of the simulation were also tested against experimentally measured erosion profiles, with good agreement.
