    In the present study, a new dynamic fluidized bed reactor (FBR) model is developed to account for the effect of bubble growth in the bed height on the dynamic behaviour of the reactor and the molecular properties of the polymer product. The model takes into account the existence of solid catalyst in both phases and consequently, the occurrence of polymerization reaction in both bubble and emulsion phases. A dynamic two-phase model is employed for predicting the key hydrodynamic parameters of the bed. A comprehensive kinetic model for ethylene polymerization in the presence of multiple-site Ziegler-Natta catalyst is considered to describe the number and molecular weight averages and molecular weight distribution of polymer in the FBR. The hydrodynamic model and the kinetic model have been coupled and solved simultaneously to simulate the performance of the fluidized bed reactor.
    The study incorporates the effects of the most important reactor parameters such as superficial gas velocity, mean particle size, inlet gas temperature, bubble size, recycle stream and chain transfer agent on the steady-state behaviour of the FBR. The proposed dynamic model is capable of predicting both the performance of the reactor and the polymer physiochemical properties.
