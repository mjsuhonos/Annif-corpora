    Efficient management of 3D geological and subsurface models require a robust 3D data modeling environment which can provide the necessary functions and flexibility to enable accessing 3D models in a collaborative work environment through the Internet. This allows geoscientists and geo-engineers to work collaboratively for better, informed decisions. Today, there is no data standard that satisfies the entire 3D geological modelling requirement in a collaborative work environment. This thesis presents the result of a research project that focuses on identifying modelling and analytical requirements of geological models and the usability of existing technologies for both database management and applications that allow sharing 3D models in a collaborative modeling environment. Specifically, it examines current 3D data models and how they can fit into the requirements of the 3D geological modeling. Based on identified system requirements, an integrated solution prototype has been implemented that allows large-scale 3D data management and provides real-time Internet access to the underlying 3D models.
