This study explores the narrative elements of film trailers to help understand their role and purpose within the marketability of trailers. Current literature from Kernan (2004) focuses on the evolution and standing of trailers as the primary marketing and promotional tool within the film industry. However, this major research paper (MRP) focuses on developing an understanding of the function of the narrative within a film trailer and how this impacts its marketability. More specifically, this MRP provides an analysis of the narrative and film techniques used in both the Jurassic Park (1993) and Jurassic World (2015) film trailers. This study was conducted through a qualitative research methodology primarily using Branigan’s (1992) Narrative Schema and Bordwell & Thompson’s (2008) cinematic framework to provide a thorough analysis of the narrative structure of both trailers. The results of this MRP indicate that the purpose of the of the narrative elements of film trailers is to create an emotional and lasting connection with the audience. Furthermore, results show that over the last twenty years, the narrative elements in successful and marketable film trailers continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated given today’s technological advancements. The narrative elements combined with the cinematic techniques are designed to heighten or intensify the audience’s emotional experience so that consumers will be more likely to view the movie in theatres.
