Practical explorations of transformable garment design are the core of my research, which aims to create sustainable design from an innovative perspective. This transformable design project creates a garment constructed from smaller components which can each be separated and recombined. The garment can be transformed, therefore, to reflect a wide variety of styles by detaching or replacing its individual components. This new, ecological design method for a multi-purpose garment reduces fabric waste, extends garment life span and engages the consumer in sustainable practices.
Transformable garments have a unique advantage in that they can both attract consumers and contribute to sustainable fashion. While this transformable project demonstrates great potential for design which cannot be fully explored here, the study provides critical insight into designer and consumer interests and practices in fashion sustainability. Along with providing greater awareness of sustainability issues in the fashion industry, the designs in this project bring sustainable fashion ideals one step closer to the mainstream.
