Detouring between buildings subverts well-worn paths and reveals untapped space designated to Torontoâ€™s extensive laneway network. Exploratory walks followed by creative transcription of the findings capture fragments that would otherwise go unnoticed. By harnessing new ways of reading the lane space, the proposed project envisions a lane-building-street hybrid, rich with urban retreats and alternate pedestrian paths. Through the reinterpretation of an existing laneway block as a catalyst, the scheme explores strategies that grant this hybrid space to curious strollers, challenging highly-regulated and standardized street space as the primary means of moving through the contemporary city. These strategies invigorate the role of architecture in enhancing the quality of urban life, rewarding pedestrians with access to the city through new routes, expanded public realm, and countless discoveries.
