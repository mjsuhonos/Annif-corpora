As of 2015 hydraulic fracking for unconventional shale gas in Ontario is not currently being used.  In this paper, qualitative in person interviews of government officials and a province wide survey of municipal leaders were conducted to determine the level of support for the potential use of unconventional fracking in Ontario.  Potential reasons for the current absence of unconventional fracking in Ontario are geology and lack of investment.  Although fracking is a topic of discussion in most municipal governments, support is low.  The likely future of unconventional fracking in Ontario is slim, but it cannot be completely ruled out.  There is a general consensus that municipal support is important if horizontal fracking was to be used in Ontario.
