The technological revolution and the resulting inception of the World Wide Web have had an unprecedented effect in the ways we find, produce, and contemplate information today.

This vision goes beyond the agency of the book and looks at the library as a socio-cultural vessel that can be responsive and dynamic when seen through this new digital lens.
