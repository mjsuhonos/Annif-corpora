Past research has often conceptualized stress from a deficit-oriented approach. This approach is unbalanced, often associating stress with negative events and outcomes. The current study examined stress from the Transactional Model, and proposed alternative ways to conceptualize stress. In addition, both psychosocial and physiological stressors were utilized to induce stress. Study aims were threefold: (1) to examine beliefs about stress and effects of framing on changes to perceptions of stress, (2) to examine the comparative effects of two different stress-induction methods, and (3) to explore the interactive effects of framing and stress-induction on subjective perceptions of stress and measures of stress reactivity. Results confirmed a deficit-orientation of stress within the sampled population. Comparative effects of both stressors highlighted differential stress responses based on task demands and appraisal. Finally, interactive effects of framing and stress-induction provided support for alternative conceptualizations of stress in adaptive coping.
