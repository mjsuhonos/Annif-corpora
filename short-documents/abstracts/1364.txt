    This study attempts to analyze the immigration and settlement experiences of the Albanian diaspora. The paper takes an historical and anthropological perspective in outlining the experiences of Albanian people through a comparative analysis of Europe and North America. This paper examines the difference experiences of migrants in Greece and Italy to those of the United States and Canada in relation to the country of origin (Albania, Kosova, or Macedonia), the time period of migration, and the reason for migration. This study will outline and analyze the more positive experiences of Albanian people in North America, compared to the somewhat more negative experiences in Europe, with a discussion on the effects media representation has had on Albanian migrants in Greece and Italy. The history of a receiving country strongly affects its perspective on immigration and consequently its reception of immigrants.
