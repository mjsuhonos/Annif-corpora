This paper suggests a framework for helping companies integrate Human Factors (HF) considerations proactively into their development process. The interactive approach draws on activities aimed at successive stages in the development process: cognitive mapping of the strategic environment, process mapping of the design process, simulation of design alternatives, and development of metrics to support ongoing evaluation. Each initiative establishes a new dialogue in the company around how HF can be usefully integrated into design routines allowing stakeholders to adopt or adapt routines that include HF aspects as a regular part of the process of creating new work-systems.
