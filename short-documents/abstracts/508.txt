    This paper examines whether the evolution of immigration policies and anti-terrorism laws in Canada and the United Kingdom reflect a process of securitization of migration. The theory developed by the Copenhagen School is employed to explain the security-migration nexus and the concept of selective securitization is introduced to explicate how certain immigration categories, such as irregular migrants, asylum seekers and refugees become the preferred target of stringent immigration and anti-terrorist laws. The paper has two inter-related central arguments: that securitization of migration began to occur prior the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks which was expanded and fast-tracked thereafter; and that the negative consequences of securitization are more evident when one takes into account the violations of immigrantsâ€™ rights.
