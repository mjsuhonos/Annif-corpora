Foreign-trained engineers make up a significant number of the skilled immigrants
accepted to Canada annually. This study seeks to identify the various barriers discussed
in the literature that these foreign-trained engineers face in gaining licensure and
successful employment in Canada. It also examines the findings from a survey conducted
of previous graduates of Ryerson University's Internationally Educated Engineers
Qualification Bridging (IEEQB) Program. The purpose of the research was to identify
whether or not the bridging program assists foreign-trained engineers in obtaining a
P.Eng license and finding employment in their fields. Twelve participants were involved
in the study; the study found that the participants faced the barriers discussed in the
literature. The information found in this study will be used as a stepping-stone in future
research to reduce the difficulties foreign-trained engineers face and assist them to
successfully integrate into the Canadian labour market.
