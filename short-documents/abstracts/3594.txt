The effectiveness of written education materials have been examined across the cardiovascular surgical setting. Inconsistent findings have indicated minimal changes to patient outcomes. The absence of significant findings may be due to the lack of control patients have over the frequency in which they can access information, the amount and type of content they are able to peruse, and the actual time the materials can be reviewed. A complement to in-hospital patient educational interventions is web-based patient education, accessed during the home discharge period. This discursive paper presents a summary of a planned web-based patient education intervention that has been designed for use by a predominantly elderly population. In particular, modifications to account for reduced visibility, decreased hearing, and onset of physical impairment are discussed.
