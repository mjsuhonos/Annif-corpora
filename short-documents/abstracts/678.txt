    This exploratory research study examines the complex reactions within the Black community in Toronto, Canada towards the opening of the first public Africentric/Black-focused school. The study seeks to understand the various hopes, fears and reservations among the Black community towards this school and the social impact Black Community members perceive the school will have on Black youth, and on Black Canadians in general. As such, the study is situated within the broader context of racism and the social exclusion of racialized minorities in Canada, with a specific focus on the experiences of Black Canadians. Included are the results of qualitative interviews with Black Canadians alongside several theoretical frameworks that assist in explaining participantsâ€™ reactions to the Africentric school in the context of the social inclusion of Blacks within mainstream Canadian society.
