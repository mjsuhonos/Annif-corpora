    Pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) are one of the most important components in security and cryptography applications. We propose an application of Hopfield Neural Networks (HNN) as pseudo random number generator. This research is done based on a unique property of HNN, i.e., its unpredictable behavior under certain conditions. Also, we propose an application of Fuzzy Hopfield Neural Networks (FHNN) as pseudo random number generator. We compare the main features of ideal random number generators with our proposed PRNGs. We use a battery of statistical tests developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to measure the performance of proposed HNN and FHNN. We also measure the performance of other standard PRNGs and compare the results with HNN and FHNN PRNG. We have shown that our proposed HNN and FHNN have good performance comparing to other PRNGs accordingly.
