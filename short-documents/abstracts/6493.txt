The purpose of this study is to investigate child, parent, and teacher perspectives of the role of a Toronto school-based health clinic (SBHC) in health care provision, as well as their experiences of accessibility, and comfort in use. This qualitative case study of a SBHC in the Toronto District School Board’s Model Schools Paediatric Health Initiative (MSPHI) uses thematic secondary data analyses informed by a grounded theory approach. The results of this study provide evidence that the SBHC plays a key role in the provision of physical health care for children; reduces health-related school absences; addresses OHIP-related barriers; and enhances the coordination of health care services. Children’s experiences of comfort over time remained stable; however, children’s perceptions of accessibility improved over time which aligned with their increased SBHC utilization.
