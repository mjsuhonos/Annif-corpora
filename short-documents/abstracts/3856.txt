This research explored whether children judge the knowledge state of others and selectively
learn novel information from them based on how they dress. The results indicated that
4- and 6-year-olds identified a formally dressed individual as more knowledgeable about
new things in general than a casually dressed one (Study 1). Moreover, children displayed
an overall preference to seek help from a formally dressed individual rather than a casually
dressed one when learning about novel objects and animals (Study 2). These findings are
discussed in relation to the halo effect, and may have important implications for child educators
regarding how instructor dress might influence young studentsâ€™ knowledge attribution
and learning preferences.
