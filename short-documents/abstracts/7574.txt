One of the IoT's greatest opportunity and application still lies ahead in the form of smart
home. In this ubiquitous/automated environment, due to the most likely heterogeneity of
objects, communication, topology, security protocols, and the computationally limited na-
ture of IoT objects, conventional authentication schemes may not comply with IoT security
requirements since they are considered impractical, weak, or outdated. This thesis proposes:
(1) The design of a two-factor device-to-device (D2D) Mutual Authentication Scheme for
Smart Homes using OTP over Infrared Channel (referred to as D2DA-OTP-IC scheme); (2)
The design of two proxy-password protected OTP-based schemes for smart homes, namely,
the Password Protected Inter-device OTP-based Authentication scheme over Infrared Chan-
nel and the Password Protected Inter-device OTP-based Authentication scheme using public
key infrastructure; and (3) The design of a RSA-based two-factor user Authentication scheme
for Smart Home using Smart Card.
