This paper is a study of the pioneer Greek immigrant and the pioneer Greek immigrant family in the United States and Canada from the 1880s to the 1920s. Our thesis is that the pioneer Greek immigrant was the executor of a well-defined family plan to help preserve as much as possible the physiognomy, identity and economic autonomy of the family unit that was left behind in the mother country. The Greek-American and Greek-Canadian family, limited in scope because of the gender composition of the early immigrants, organized itself in a "defensive" manner, i.e. it "closed" itself to the outside world and remained "frozen in time", as a result of the hardships of immigrant life, including the racism of the host countries.
