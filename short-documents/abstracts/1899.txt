    Safety performance functions (SPFs) are rarely developed for specific accident types because this can be very lengthy especially when relevant data are unavailable. Because of this constraint, a factor is applied along with the SPF for all accident types to estimate the safety for specific accidents types. This factor is the proportion of the individual collision type in the entire population of all accidents. However, there is no reason to believe that this factor is a constant which is independent of Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT). Accordingly, a constant factor and the proportion model are applied to the SPF for all accident types combined to estimate the SPF for specific accident types on both rural road segments and Two-Way Stop-Controlled (TWSC) intersections. The validity of these factors are tested using the state-of-the-art network screening approaches. Furthermore, a detailed investigation on Property Damaage Only (PDO) estimates is carried out on certain aspects of safety performance functions, using negative binomial regression. PDO estimates are then evaluated based on three different approaches.
