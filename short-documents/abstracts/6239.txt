This paper will evaluate the extent to which grade 9/10 Canadian and World Studies curriculum in Ontario perpetuates a monolithic, nation centered focus of citizenship and history at the exclusion of racialized and immigrant groups, and to what extent it includes racialized and immigrant groups.

Other sub-themes which have informed the broader categories mentioned above are racism and nationalism.
