    A review of statistics on HIV infection in Canada shows that the rates of HIV infection are on the rise among immigrants. Like other newcomers in Canada, immigrants living with or affected by HIV/AIDS seek services from various agencies serving immigrants. The purpose of this study is to identify and highlight barriers experienced by service providers when dealing with immigrants and particularly immigrant women who are living with HIV/AIDS. Some of the barriers they experienced include stigma, denial, fear, and discrimination, as well as socio-cultural and religious beliefs, economic and structural factors like immigration status, racism, marginalization and language.
