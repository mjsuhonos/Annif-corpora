PLC controllers in today's day are a staple mechanism to control operation of large number of machines and devices in the industry. With their advanced usage, it is increasingly becoming a staple and important part of Engineering. Thus, it is crucial that this knowledge is effectively delivered to students with practical applications.
This paper presents a series of laboratory experiments for students to learn and explore the various industrial applications of PLCâ€™s. The control problems in this paper are defined with respect to their applications in different industries such as automotive, steel, oil and electronics. Applications are typical processes that can be observed in these industries such as material conveying, material handling, cutting processes, system control and temperature control. All the problems are solved using Ladder Logic programming on Automation Studio to simulate these processes and provide students with a wholesome learning experience.
