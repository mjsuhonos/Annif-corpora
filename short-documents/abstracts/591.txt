    Statistics Canada has reported that intermarriage, which is defined as marriages that take place outside the boundaries of tradition, religion, caste, and geographical origins, is on the rise in Canada. While the economic integration of immigrants in Canada has been thoroughly researched, couple and family formation are less researched but fundamental aspects of the settlement and accommodation of immigrants in receiving countries. Using both assimilation theory and transnationalism, I will critically review the way in which intermarriage is interpreted in the literature and demonstrate a gap in regards to contemporary studies of intermarriage. In-depth interviews were conducted with three white, Canadian-born women and their racialized/immigrant husbands in Southern Ontario to gain insight into their everyday, lived experiences. Through the exploration of themes such as identity, culture, gender, and family relationships, the findings suggest that intermarried couples are continually negotiating transnational ideas, values, and practices.
