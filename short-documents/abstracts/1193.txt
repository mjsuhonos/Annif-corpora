    Canadaâ€™s settlement sector underwent substantial changes in December 2010. Settlement agencies experienced significant cutbacks from the federal government, which has created a climate of uncertainty as to how these agencies will sustain themselves if cuts continue to occur. This paper aims to analyze a model of funding that has gained popularity in recent years. I analyze the concept of social entrepreneurship, which brings together the private, voluntary, and public spheres and allows agencies to become less reliant on government funding. After a deep investigation I explore whether this concept is a possible solution to deal with the consequences of funding cuts.
