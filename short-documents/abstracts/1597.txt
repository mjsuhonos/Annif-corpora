    Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) is the next generation layer-2 protocol optimized for transporting data traffic rather than circuit-based traffic. In this thesis, we design and evaluate our own RPR simulation model that is fully compliant with the latest proposal promoted by IEEE 802.17 Work Group.
    By using this model, we investigate the limitations of the fairness control algorithms proposed by IEEE 802.17 WG. An alternative design, namely, Fuzzy Logic Control, is considered to overcome the shortcomings. Real world scenarious are simulated using this new approach. The simulation results justify the application of this new RPR model, and support its validity.
    Furthermore, by using this model we also derived an equation to calculate Fairness Round Trip Time (FRTT), which is a key parameter in designing an appropriated size for Secondary Transit Queue (STQ) in RPR. This equation overcomes the limitations proposed by IEEE 802.17 Work Group.
