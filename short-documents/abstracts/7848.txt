Generic Escape: Reframing narratives and breaking code
It is dark and stormy, and you switch on the television in the 1990s. The cable signal is out so what do you see? Often times you will receive a signal that looks like a bunch of coloured bars. Other times, all you get is an electronic noisy image. Today, this noisy visual effect is often intentionally produced by manipulating, distorting, or blurring the pixel structure of an image with photo-editing software. The accidental or unintended outcome of the technological errors  that produce these images somehow speaks to our subconscious need for a break from the reality of well-defined narratives and circumscribed modes of interpretation (Kane, 2016).
