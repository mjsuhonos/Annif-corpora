Urban growth and change in Downtown Toronto is proceeding at an unprecedented rate.  While this is indicative of a robust economic climate and vibrant streetscape, the pace of this development presents a host challenges to City of Toronto as it attempts to maintain a high quality of life for its residents.

Using a mixed methods research approach, primary survey data is complemented with key informant interviews.  Discussion touches on issues of small living spaces, a perceived lack of diversity in housing options, the need for public realm enhancement, and the potential of the Development Permits System as a alternative planning framework to improve quality of life for current and future Downtown residents.
