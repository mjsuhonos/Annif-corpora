    The present study investigated whether individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) could be trained to adopt an abstract or concrete processing style and the impact of processing style training on GAD symptoms and cognitive processes, including an interpretation bias, negative problem solving orientation, poor problem solving, and worry. Participants (N=47) were trained to adopt an abstract or concrete processing style, and outcome measures were completed at posttraining and 1 week follow-up. At posttraining, processing style training was effective in inducing an abstract or concrete processing style. In addition, at posttraining, the concrete training condition reported reduced concern with ambiguous scenarios and produced problem solutions that were rated as more effective compared with the abstract training condition. At follow-up, there was no difference between training conditions on processing style and associated GAD symptoms and cognitive processes. Study limitations and future directions are discussed.
