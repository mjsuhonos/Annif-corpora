    The following is a professional practice project which focuses on the research, methodology, and development of a finding aid for the Models' Guild of Philadelphia Collection, which currently resides in the Richard and Ronay Menschel Library at George Eastman House as part of the Dr. Louis Walton Sipley collection which was donated by 3M in 1977. The contents of this collection include business correspondence documents, ephemera, photographs, and other material dating from 1946 to approximately 1963. This project was undertaken with the goal of organizing, and inventorying the collections that it would be more accessible to researchers within the Library at George Eastman House.
