In order to choose from a list of functionally similar services, users often need to make their decisions based on multiple QoS criteria they require on the target service. In this process, different users may follow different decision making strategies, some are compensatory and some are non-compensatory. Most of the current QoS-based service selection systems do not consider these decision strategies in the ranking process, which we believe are crucial for generating accurate ranking results for individual users. In this thesis, we propose a decision strategy based service ranking model. Furthermore, considering that different users follow different strategies in different contexts at different times, we apply a learning to rank algorithm to learn a personalized ranking model for individual users based on how they select services in the past. Our experiment result shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
