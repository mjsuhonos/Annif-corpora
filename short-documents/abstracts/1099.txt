The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the effectiveness of current legal measures for protecting species at risk in Canada through an interpretive qualitative method. Four species case studies were analyzed: The Eastern Loggerhead Shrike, Jefferson Salamander, Northern Spotted Owl, and Vancouver Island Marmot. Policy recommendations for reforms arising from the research are: i) inter-jurisdictional cooperation is imperative for protecting species at risk; ii) dedicated species at risk legislation is crucial, and it is recommended that such legislation exist at both federal and provincial levels; iii) flexibility instruments and exemptions to existing law should be scientifically informed and used cautiously; iv) private landowners are significant stakeholders and stewardship efforts are important; v) scientific information and the definition of critical habitat for species at risk are crucial. The thesis concludes that a science-based precautionary approach to species protection is fundamental to address the plight of species at risk in Canada.
