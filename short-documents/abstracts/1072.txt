    The potency of compelling narrative structures - or the story constructing sequence of space - has pushed architecture's boundaries into new frontiers through the development of representational technology such as cinema, a burgeoning art form that employs narrative typology as an underlying structure to frame the phenomena of space. In this design research thesis my intention is to investigate and elucidate the function and purpose of narrative in Architecture and Cinema and its development from symbolism to spatial formation. Thesis statement: The first stage of narrative from took flight from pictographic symbols and cartographic delineations to sculptural representations and reliefs. These timeless narratives encapsulated in monumental structures such as the Pyramids of Giza or the Greek Parthenon depict their civilizations' cultural dominance through this system of messaging. It can be argued that a number of such illustrations may reveal varying levels of codification or messaging through historical, cultural, or religious contexts. However, the present form of this system of messaging and symbolism has been considerably altered for the worse, becoming banal and superficial, and lacking depth and narrative content.
