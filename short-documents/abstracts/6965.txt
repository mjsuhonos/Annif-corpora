The rapid development of information technology and medical research in the 21st century is a result of the increasing number of inventions. Inventive activity is thought to be an important catalyst for economic change and increased productivity. In order to measure a locationâ€™s inventive potential, different aspects such as geographic location, corporate assistance, and socio-economic factors can be studied. This study examines the spatial distribution and typology of Canadian inventions for the years 1991, 2001, 2006, and 2011, using patent data issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
The research results suggest that inventive activity is declining in major metropolitan areas such as Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal. On the other hand, medium-sized metropolitan areas like Ottawa, Calgary, Kitchener-Waterloo, and Saskatoon are experiencing increasing inventiveness. These areas have specialized economies based on high technology and petroleum. The regression analysis shows that regional innovation can be explained by census variables in groups of dwelling type, education level, and industry sector. The analysis also shows Canada has shifted from a manufacturing economy to a high technology and services-based economy.
