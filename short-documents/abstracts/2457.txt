    Surface reconstruction of 3D reverse engineering data through the application of a triangulated mesh is a popular method. This thesis proposes a new simple genetic algorithm, an artificial intelligence method, to optimize triangular mesh generation which reduces the number of data points required to depict an object without sacrificing the details and accuracy.
