    The synthesis and characterization of new copper pincer complexes via cyclometallation of potentially anionic pincer ligands with C1 point group symmetry is reported. All of these complexes have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction method, which confirms the proposed tridentate binding mode of pincer ligand and the formation of an amido N-Cu bond. The reactivity of two of the complexes was investigated towards C-C bond formation reaction, notably the Henry reaction. One of the complexes, which was derived from the achiral pincer ligand, is shown to be a suitable catalyst for the Henry reaction under the standard conditions. The Henry or nitroaldol reaction is one of the organic reactions which affords a C-C bond. The product of this reaction is a Î²-nitro alcohol which is formed by addition of a nitroalkane to a carbonyl compound.
