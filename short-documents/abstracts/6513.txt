Drawing on transgender, queer and feminist theoretical perspectives, I critically analyze two
children’s picture books featuring transgender and gender variant characters. With these critical
theoretical perspectives in mind, this discourse analysis examines the ways the books, both
visually and textually, depict gender embodiment and the experiences of the characters. Using
questions derived from these theoretical lenses, I analyze concepts of power, normalcy,
difference, the gender binary, gender fluidity, intelligibility and unintelligibility. These concepts
contribute to the dominant discourse of ‘the gaze’, seen in varying ways in the books. Children’s
story books largely underrepresent the experiences of transgender characters, particularly books
outlining, and explaining, a social gender transition. The majority of picture books with
LGBTQ+ themes focus on same sex families and feature boys in dresses, thus centralize around
disrupting the constraints of masculinity. I conclude this paper with recommendations for
selecting, reading, and discussing books with transgender and gender variant protagonists. The
central themes outlined in the academic literature illustrate that ‘the gaze’ and regulation of
knowledge have a significant impact on what is visible in children’s books. This may ultimately
affect children’s understanding, and appreciation, of gender variance and, hence, social gender
transitions in early childhood.
