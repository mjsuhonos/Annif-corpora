Determining the solar energy potential on a surface depends on geographical location, prevailing meteorological conditions, size, shape and orientation of a surface. In urban areas shading is an important parameter, given the density of buildings and must be considered in an evaluation of available irradiation. This thesis develops an integrated workflow for modelling and mapping solar energy potentials in urban areas. This was accomplished through a case study of a typical large urban centre - The City of Toronto, using 3-D building models and selected software tools. The developed workflow was applied and successfully modelled the solar energy potential of buildings in the selected case study area. The results allowed for further characterization of the main factors affecting solar energy potentials on building surfaces in urban areas.  This preliminary study indicates that, in comparison to HVAC systems and green roofs, shading may be a less important factor to consider when estimating solar energy potentials in some urban settings.
