Depictions (drawings, models) play a significant role in giving architecture form through the use of various techniques and mediums of expression. These forms of depictions invite an experimental design approach and generate critical thinking in design. The aim in this thesis is to look at architecture critically and investigate design approaches to enhance architectural ideas through varying forms of depiction such as drawing, painting, sculpture, and digital media. Experimentally driven design processes have the potential to push ideas to greater heights in the architectural discipline. Architectural depiction that pursues ideas or notions that may never be built are significant forms of production that push design thinking into other territories; they are in and of themselves architecture. Specifically, the design of a ‘House of the Imagination’ becomes a vehicle in the thesis for experimental architectural ideas and provides an alternative setting for architectural form making.
