This mixed methodological study involving newcomer youth aged 17-24 and settlement service staff explores the role of technology in the process of settlement and the youth newcomer services. The findings indicate that youth prefer direct engagement with services and resources as they navigate the barriers that impact their access to mainstream and settlement service resources. They want to improve the quality of their engagement in communication as they strive to become part of their community. Participants involved in the study did not see technology as central to delivering youth settlement services. Youth did see the internet as necessary for schooling and in bridging to friends and family back home. The findings reflect the paucity of resources and capacity of mainstream and settlement specific services to meet the needs of youth, a lack of focus on integrated and accountable realm of settlement services specific to the needs of newcomer youth.
