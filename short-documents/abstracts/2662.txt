This paper will challenge the traditional approach to providing bus transit, particularly on
busy high-frequency arterial routes. It posits that conventional bus services are unable to
meet contemporary urban sustainability and mobility challenges. Emerging approaches,
such as the various forms of bus rapid transit, hold promise as ways to improve the
perception of the bus and its usefulness to current transit riders and potential riders. This
study uses a survey of best practice in bus transit improvements, as well as key informant
interviews with professional service planners in the transit industry. Key findings are
directed at the need for new and interdisciplinary ways of working, interdepartmental
coordination, a high degree of active public engagement, and physical changes to bus
transit systems. The findings informed a series of recommendations to help address the
image and performance of bus transit in Toronto.
