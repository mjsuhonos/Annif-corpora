    Understanding dynamic environments is a problem that many developers face when developing mobile applications for a particular domain. Dynamic environments can contain large sets of objects, people, and places that have varying characteristics and attributes that are constantly changing. Therefore, understanding all of the domain concepts and their relationships is a challenge for many application developers. To solve this problem an ontology based framework, ADOPT (context-Aware Domain Ontology-based framework for Public Transportation) was constructed to provide application developers with teh necessary tools and concepta that will allow them to quickly create and personalize mobile applications for the public transportation domain even if they have a limited knowledge of teh domain. The goal of ADOPT is to provide appliation developers with a better understanding of their desired domain in order to personalize an application to meet the travel needs of various different types of passengers.
