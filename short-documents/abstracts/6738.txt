The present Professional Practice Project is intended as an essay on Brazilian photography. From its history to the naming of selected contemporary artists, this proposal is an overview of photography in Brazil. This paper aims to be a tool for those proposing the acquisition of something unknown to an institution such as George Eastman House, and to prove that it is important to look for images beyond the range of familiar knowledge.                                                        
This essay includes an acquisition proposal, with a short biography on each artist included, as well as a section on the history of photography in Brazil. There is also a segment on the acquisitions policies of the institution for which this proposal has been written, with the story of how the major collections within it came to be there.
