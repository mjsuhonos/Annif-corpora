    The main focus of thesis work addresses one of the functional key points of Cooperative Collision Warning application which is an accurate estimation of the range data of neighboring vehicles during persistent GPS outages under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situations. Cooperative Collision Warning, based on vehicle-to-vehicle radio communications and GPS systems, is one promising active safety application that has attracted considerable research interest. One of the severe estimation error is due to NLOS that can be mitigated by applying biased Kalman filter on range measurements. For our algorithm these inter-vehicle distances are measured from using one of the radio-based ranging techniques. Main objective is to establish an accurate map of positions for neighboring vehicles in the persistance of GPS outages. GPS outages can be possible in multipath environments where NLOS component is introduced to the true range measurements. These position estimates mainly depend on two factors: (i) Preprocessed inter-vehicle distances (range data is processed from biased Kalman filter); (ii) Road constraints (the vehicle uncertainty is more in the direction of road than the uncertainty in the direction opposite the road); This thesis suggests smoothing and mitigating the NLOS for radio-based ranging measurements under multipath conditions. In order to find accurate positions of neighboring vehicles an extended Kalman filter is implemented along with road constraints. Unbiased Kalman filter, biased Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter performances are experimentally verified using Matlab simulation tool with random number of vehicles at unknown random distinct positions in some physical region along a section of road for vehicular environment.
