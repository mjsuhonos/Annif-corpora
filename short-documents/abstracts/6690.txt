Competition for delivering high-bandwidth "multi-play" services (video, voice, data) is on constant
increase. Advanced service delivery requires a higher bandwidth pipe to the end user through passive
optical network (PON) technologies.
The two major PON standards GPON is an International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication
Standardization Sector (ITU-T) and EPON is a standard developed by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
This project compares and looks at the choices and challenges service providers face as they bring new
PON technology possibilities to their customers and analyze these two standards in terms of their
performance, physical properties, implementation and testing requirements. It also discusses the
evolution paths for each of the standards and the challenges for such evolution. The final chapter will
include the conclusions, some final thoughts, suggestions and recommendations for new projects
implementation.
