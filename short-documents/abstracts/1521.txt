    The aims of this secondary analysis were to describe medication taking behaviour and health beliefs among people with mild to moderate CKD, examine differences in health beliefs according to age and gender, and examine relationships between health beliefs and medication taking behaviour. The sample consisted of 30 men and 30 women between19 and 72 years old. Forty-two participants reported they did not miss medication doses, but remembering to take all the pills was the most challenging. Women were more likely to believe their kidney function would improve in the future and to believe treatment would keep them from becoming ill. No statistically significant differences were found in health beliefs by age. Perceived barriers were the strongest indicator of medication taking behaviour. Findings from this study shed light on the complexity of the medication regimen in CKD, and could guide health care providers to better support medication taking behaviour.
