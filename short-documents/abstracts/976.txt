    A stable microbial consortium capable of cellulose hydrolysis under initial aerobic conditions has been enriched in a continuous flow system. Anaerobic conditions were created and maintained within the flow system using only microbial metabolism. A DGGE community profile of samples taken throughout the enrichment process indicates that the community stabilized upon entry into the continuous flow system, and maintained function and members throughout. The effect of flow rate on cellulose degradation and end product production was assessed. The cellulose degradation rate was found to be notably faster at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min (D 0.75/hr) than a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min (D1.50/hr). Furthermore, an ethanol to acetate ratio nearly 8 times higher than previously reported values in the literature was also observed at 0.1 ml/min (D0.75/hr). With reduced flow rate and high ethanol to acetate ratios, the enriched community may be well suited for consolidate bioprocessing.
