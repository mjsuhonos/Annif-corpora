    In this thesis, an adaptive mechanism for controlling the illumination is combined with a closed loop technique and the use of High Dynamic range (HDR) to generate a black box model that can simulate the hard proof of a given digital image. An adaptive Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to create the black box model, using the camera as a measuring device. The non-uniformity of the illumination in the viewing booth is typically a barrier in creating such a black box model since color appearance varies with location in the viewing booth. This issue was addressed in this thesis by compensation for viewing booth illumination using an inexpensive camera and a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) projector. HDR was found to give a favourable representation that is more indicative of the image perceived by the operator, and was used as the basis for mapping the original image to the soft proof. A proof of concept was also developed to highlight the utility of the LCD projector based approach in providing a more broad range of varying intensity color illuminants (thus environments) under which a proof may be not only viewed, but modeled through the closed loop process. In this sense, a system has been developed to generate and provide custom soft proofs that can extend the functionality of the standard viewing booth. The proposed technique will open the doors to new automated systems that can be very beneficial to the printing industry.
