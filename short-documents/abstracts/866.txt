    The purpose of this practical thesis project was to create a guidebook for collecting subject-based information gathered through community participation and collaboration. Specifically, this involved collecting subject descriptions for a photograph collection based on an organized and planned meeting with local residents familiar with the contents of the images. All fieldwork was completed over a nine-week period, from June 5 through August 2, 2006, at the Bruce County Museum and Cultural Centre, Southampton, Ontario with the John H. Scougall Collection. 105 images were selected for discussion and subject identification by community members. What follows is a guidebook to inform others how to carry out such a project. Each section begins with general comments and ideas, followed by specific examples of what took place with the Scougall Collection and the participating residents of Kincardine.
