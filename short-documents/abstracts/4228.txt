The performance gap, the difference between how a building was intended to Perform  and its actual performance, poses a challenge to successful high performance  design. This research examines the application of submetering data and whole building energy models to evaluate the performance gap in buildings as related to energy consumption, and in specific energy use associated with receptacles and lighting. While difficulties in grappling with large amounts of data persist, results indicate that building management and occupancy issues can offer an explanation for a significant portion of differences between predicted and actual energy use. Experience working with these data sets also suggests that further efforts are required to demonstrate the value of submetering in order to ensure submetering systems are not compromised by the value engineering process.
