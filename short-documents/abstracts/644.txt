    The author proposes a working model solution for a digital collection catalogue database, in FileMaker Pro. The catalogue cross-references photographs, publications, exhibitions, sales, correspondence, and other activity incidental to a photographer's career and body of work. The studio and archive of Sally Mann, an influential and highly regarded American photographer, is used as an illutrative example.
