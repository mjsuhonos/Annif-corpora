    Although the direction of contemporary architectural thinking is heavily influenced by its critical engagement with energy usage, this relationship remains largely unexplored imaginatively. This thesis investigates an energy-centric approach to design that is enabled by digital workspace. By injecting energy transactions and modulations into otherwise abstract digital geometry while using analysis tools to examine their effects, the work is intended to speculate what this relationship with energy could be. For too long the application of emerging computer-based technologies in architecture have resisted critical agendas beyond idealist shape-making and form. At the same time the role of energy in the design process has been subsidiary and weak. Both fields of knowledge and their relationship to architecture are examined in a necessary marriage of mission and means. The research portion of this document concludes with a series of speculations that illustrate possible outcomes of the proposed energetic agenda.
