Growing up in Northern Ontario and then being a temporary resident in Toronto, it became very evident to me that many issues, especially financial insecurity, were very different between the two areas. I spoke to someone from Toronto who had visited Northern Ontario in the past and the first thing he told me was that it was a whole other world there and that the realities of financial insecurity were very evident. I decided then that my MRP should focus on an issue close to my heart that can serve as a tool to raise awareness on the issue. This MRP focuses on a gap in the
current literature and the narratives of five Northern Ontarians who have grown up with financial insecurity and wanted to make their stories heard.
