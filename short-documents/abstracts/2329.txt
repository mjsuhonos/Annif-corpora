    This research presents the numerical analysis of the triply coupled flap-wise, cord-wise and torsional vibrations of flexible rotating blades. Euler-Bernoulli bending and St. Venant torsion beam theories are considered to derive the governing differential equations of motion. Based on Finite Element Methodology (FEM), the cubic "Hermite" shape functions are implemented where the solution of the equations results in a linear engine problem. Then, the Dynamic (frequency dependent) Trigonometric Shape Functions (DISF's) for beam's uncoupled displacements are derived. The application of the Dynamic Finite Element (DFE) approach to the solution of the governing equations is then presented. The DFE formulation, based on the weighted residual method and the DTSF's results in a nonlinear engine problem representing eigenvalues and engine modes of the system. The applicability of the DFE method is then demonstrated by illustrative examples, where a Wittrick-Williams root counting technique is used to find the system's natural frequencies. The DFE approach, an intermediate method between FEM and "Exact" formulation, is characterized by higher convergence rates, and can be advantageously used when multiple natural frequencies and/or higher modes of beam-like structures are to be evaluated.
