    Architecture is capable of increasing the energy consciousness of its occupants through the development of spaces that promote active participation with solar energy systems. Current architectural practice maximizes neither the availability of solar energy nor the potential of solar technologies, failing to recognize critical social elements of renewable energy and address an increasing disconnect between individual energy use and energy source. Through an architectural response, this thesis explores the role of active solar technologies in mediating between occupants, internal and external environments, and energy consumption patterns. The development of an inteactive, energy gathering, animated façade, challenges the perceived 'value' of energy, forcing occupants to measure consumption choices against desires for daylight, views, and the ability to generate income. A transactive environment that makes occupants' lifestyles explicit on a building's façade ensure individuals achieve a heightened sense of energy awareness requiring them to engage their architecture and question overyday energy decisions.
