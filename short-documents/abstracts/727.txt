    This thesis is a survey of current issues surrounding face-mounting; a mounting method for large scale photographs where the face, or front of the photography is permanently adhered to a sheet of clear acrylic. This relatively new process is controversial because of the preservation concerns in combination with a high monetary value that is now being applied to the work of some contemporary artists utilizing this process for large scale photographs. Through interviews with photographers, gallerists, curators, and conservators, this paper explores the rationale behind the use of face-mounting, as well as its aesthetic and preservation impact, its presence on the fine art market, and its future in private and public collections.
