    There is currently very little literature available that describes a defined method for designing an EMS [Environmental Management System]. The thesis hypothesis was that the Six Sigma TM method could be applied to EMS design. The Six Sigma TM method was chosen because it has been successfully implemented in many large corporations in order to improve the quality of products and business processes. Six Sigma TM provides a defined and structured method that allows a problem or opportunity to be defined, measured, analysed, improved, and controlled. This results in a method that can be used over and over again, to design or improve an EMS. This is a concept that [has] not been thoroughly developed in EMS literature to date. However, it is the structured process of Six Sigma TM itself that is probably more beneficial in EMS design as opposed to focusing on which tools are used during the DMAIC process.
