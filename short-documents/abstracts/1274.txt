    Participatory evaluation research (PER) is a research method that promotes decolonization among remote First Nations communities. Traditional methods of research have marginalized First Nations people while advancing western knowledge. As colonization worked to expunge First Nations cultural values from western mainstream knowledge, PER constructs new meaning derived from First Nations world perspectives. The present study explores the initial stages of implementing PER in a remote northern Ontario First Nations community. Community members are invited to form a research team to evaluate the outcomes of services available within the community. All levels of Canadian government are encouraged to embrace PER as a tactic for reducing racism so deeply rooted in policy.
