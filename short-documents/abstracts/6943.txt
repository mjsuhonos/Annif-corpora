In the digital age, a cultural shift has arisen that privileges individual agency, leading to architectural repercussions in place-making. By contrast, a dissociation develops toward physical places that present as prescriptive, homogeneous, or superficial to its users. The architecture of place should progress from images of consumerism and containers of behaviour to become active producers of individual agency, mediated through the architectural interface. This thesis examines the design interfaces of institutional places, studying the relationships between agency and spatial structure. It introduces a contemporary reconstruction of place-making methods that involves the layering of ambient cues, shifting narratives, network connectivity, and dispositional identity in the architectural interface. Applying this method, the design project focuses on mediating the userâ€™s journey and opportunistic settlement in realtime and real-place. The result is an architectural interface that communicates a greater sense of agency, contributing to the heuristic formation of individual landscapes of place.
