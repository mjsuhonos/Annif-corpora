    In this applied thesis project, a sample booklet of various expired silver gelatin papers is created. Specific information on the use of expired photographic papers by contemporary photographers is discussed as well as insights from collection caretakers (collection managers/archivists/conservators) on the possible implications that printing with expired silver gelatin papers may have for the long-term preservation of photographic works.
    The major contribution of this thesis is to create and gain a better understanding of tools that can be used in the characterisation and identification of expired silver gelatin papers. It is also to demonstrate that a tactile tool such as the sample booklet can assist in identifying various deterioration events. I feel that it is important to have a hands-on source that can be used independently or collectively with other sources such as web-based visual identification tools. The booklet will be useful as an educational tool for students, collection care takers, as well as professionals in the photographic field.
