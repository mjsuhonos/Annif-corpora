Librarianship typically discusses the virtues of open access publishing; this session will focus on its darker side. We will discuss the experiences of challenging a predatory publisher who appeared to violate the Creative Commons Licensing attached to our published journal article. Next, we will outline how we discovered this apparent copyright infringement, sought legal advice, and share perspectives on the issue from other involved authors, the journalâ€™s editorial team, and other interested parties. This case study will highlight the complex landscape of scholarly publishing and copyright in an open access world.
