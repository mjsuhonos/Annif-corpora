This paper specifically looks at the role Business Improvement Areas (BIAs) fulfill in both urban and rural contexts in order to characterize a perceived trend toward broad based community planning and local economic development work. The method draws on literature, award winning case examples, primary interview findings and an examination of planning tools to determine BIAs position within the planning framework, and advance recommendations for a BIA2.0 agenda. The findings confirm BIAs position in community planning and local economic development work, and outlines opportunities to advance their role as community building agents as part of the BIA2.0 agenda. Ultimately, the research highlights the BIA as a unique relationship shared between municipalities and business owners. It presents a rare opportunity for planners and policy makers to harness BIAs entrepreneurial spirit, market knowledge and social capital in order to implement policy objectives from the ground up.
