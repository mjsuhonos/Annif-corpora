The revitalization of brownfields provides many health benefits.  Revitalization addresses historical contamination and it allows to re-design the community with health in mind.  It is recognized that public health units (PHUs) have an important role to play on brownfield sites.  Information suggests that Ontario PHUs often become involved on brownfield sites but the extend of that involvement is not known.
Ontario PHUs were surveyed about their involvement on brownfield sites.  The results indicate that  most Ontario PHUs engage in brownfield redevelopment to some extent.  Public health units identified inadequate resources, expertise, and lack of training as the most critical factors affecting their response.
Results of the survey were further compared with the ATSDR Brownfields/Land Revitalization Action Model.  This critical analysis helped to identify key gaps and weaknesses in the current Ontario practices.  The results are used to propose recommendations to enhance public health practice and to  maximize community health benefits.
