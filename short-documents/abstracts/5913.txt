To explore the mental health experiences of first generation Afghan, post-secondary students in Toronto Canada, qualitative interviews were conducted with three post-secondary Afghan Students from Ryerson University, York University and University of Toronto. This study highlights systemic oppression and institutional barriers that young Afghan adults face as students in post-secondary institutions and the mental health implications faced as a result of on-going prejudice and discrimination. The findings present a compelling case for rethinking the practices and policies that educational institutions have "normalized", using a critical and intersectional analysis in reformulating these practices and policies. The study also highlights the importance of providing a voice to students in planning services and spaces that encourage a sense of belonging and support possibilities for success.
