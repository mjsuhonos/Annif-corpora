Solar heat gains, heating, cooling and lighting energy demands are the primary energy associated with building operation. Glare and solar heat gains are the common issues in the buildings with high window to wall ratio. Window blinds are commonly used to control the glare which blocks the natural lights as well. Scientifically designed external shading devise also helps to control glare which are merely used in the tall modern glass buildings. So renewable technologies like Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) can be one of the strategies to address the primary energy demand of the building, glare control as well as on site electricity generation. The study includes the performance of BIPV application in the faculty office area of third floor of ARC building at Ryerson University. It shows that the BIPV can be effective by addressing the lighting, cooling demand effectively.
