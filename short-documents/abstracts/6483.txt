This mixed-method study compared 5 to 8 years old children from Canada and Slovakia and their relationship with nature. A total of 52 children participated in this study; more specifically, 26 children from Toronto, Canada and 26 children from Bratislava, Slovakia. The children’s relationship with nature was examined through understanding their definition of nature, experiences in and feelings towards nature. Children illustrated a picture of nature and their
activities in it. They then participated in semi-structured interview and lastly participated in a dialogue about photographs of nature. The ‘new sociology of childhood’ and ‘universalism in cross-cultural psychology’ theoretical frameworks were used to frame this study. The results revealed that there were no cultural differences in the children’s relationship with nature; however, cultural differences were apparent in the way children constructed their relationship.  Children from both countries exhibited positive feelings towards nature, but the way they engaged with it was culturally different. Therefore, culture plays a role when establishing a connection with nature. Recognizing that children from various cultural backgrounds enjoy being in nature and acknowledging nature’s positive effects on their overall well-being can help guide parents, caregivers, educators and policy makers to work together to ensure children can reap the benefits of nature for their healthy development.
