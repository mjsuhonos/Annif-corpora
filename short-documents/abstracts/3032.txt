There is an urgent need to provide, maintain and revitalize social housing in Canada.  Statistics show that an alarming percentage of Toronto's population lives in poverty.  71,000 families are currently on the social-housing waiting list and 150,000 to 300,000 Canadians are homeless.  This research provides a critical analysis of the past and existing issues surrounding the design and function of social housing communities.  In response to the issues outlined, this study identifies a need for the design of mixed-activity, 'integrated neighbourhoods' rather than isolated social housing schemes.  The thesis proposes an architectural solution that draws on five guiding principles (modes of integration) of design.  Integration of movement, open spaces, physical structures, social integration, and integrated sustainable systems were the five categories used to examine the level of intervention necessary for the revitalization of a selected site; Alexandra Park, Toronto, Canada.
