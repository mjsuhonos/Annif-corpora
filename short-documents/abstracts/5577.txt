An aerodynamic analysis tool for the conceptual design of high-lift devices has been developed. The
method employs a higher-order potential ow method that uses elements of distributed vorticity. The
subsequent numerically robust model allows for strong wake interactions, even when using a relaxed wake.
The method predicts lift and induced drag values that compare well with multiple data experiments,
and, when implemented in a panel code, maximum lift predictions of a high-lift system are found with an
error of 6% from experimental data. This method is used to assess the impact that various wake models
have on lift and induced drag predictions. This study shows that significant errors can be introduced
when employing a prescribed wake model set to extreme angles. Compared to an approach using CFD,
the computational expense of these models is relatively low. A single analysis requires minutes, making
these models suitable for the iterative conceptual design phase
