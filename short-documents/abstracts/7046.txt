Social media can act as an invaluable tool that businesses can use as a means of reaching out and engaging with current and potential customers. Instagram, a Social Network Service known for its predominance as a photo-and-video focused sharing platform, is often used and even presented by the company as a tool to drive awareness about a business and pique interest in the products or services that they offer to its over 700 million users. However, this particular platform is being employed as more than just an advertising and marketing agent outside of Canada and the USA. In particular, Instagram in South Korea has transformed into an even more multifaceted experience, from being used as a product catalogue for retail startups to operating as a mobile online marketplace where direct, transactional exchange occurs.
