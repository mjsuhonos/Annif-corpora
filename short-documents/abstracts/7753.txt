The updated Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (2017) requires all GO rail station areas to achieve a minimum density of 150 residents and jobs combined per hectare. Intensification is unlikely to occur without intentional policy and partnerships to encourage development. Mid-rise buildings, the typical residential form needed to meet the intensification target, are often challenging to develop in suburban areas. Similarly, employment intensification can be challenging to achieve without incentives for office location. Policy, politics and market viability all impact intensification. Changes are needed at the provincial, regional and local level to encourage development. Regulatory changes like zoning, partnerships between Metrolinx and developers and/or financial incentives, such as reduced development charges, should be explored to encourage intensification. Suburban GO rail station intensification is an opportunity to achieve multiple policy goals, such as the creation of walkable, affordable communities that increase housing choice.
