Airflows in the cutting/collection/discharge system of a professional lawn care system were studied numerically and experimentally in this thesis. Various three-dimensional and two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics models were developed in order to investigate the complex airflow created by a pair of counter-rotating blades. The three-dimensional models were used to study the actual flows; the two-dimensional models were developed to investigate the optimal shapes of the rotating blades using the mass flow rate per unit power consumption as the objective function. Experiments were carried out mainly to validate the computer models developed in this study for airflow velocity and power usage for an actual cutting system. 
  Vibrations of a cutting blade were studied using the finite element method and experiments. It was found that the blades will experience resonance under normal operating conditions.
