    This paper examines the issue of parking demand and station area office development at station area mobility hubs. Metrolinx, the Provincial regional transit-planning agency in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, has identified mobility hubs at locations with high transit connectivity and potential for mixed-use intensification. The Mobility Hub Guidelines provide a vision that emphasizes placemaking and station functionality. Attracting the desired form of development to mobility hubs will require a new approach to parking management and station access. This must address market realities and the double parking burden between the station and new developments. A variety of approaches are considered which could be implemented in various combinations at different mobility hub locations. These approaches include fine-tuning parking standards, reducing parking demand and facilitating a modal split shift in station access. The paper highlights that a number of innovative approaches are available, but will require proactive involvement from interested agencies.
