This report provides review of importance of power system protection and presents different techniques available in practical situations.  The material provided in this report is available online on different resources.  Moreover, this report examines different types of faults in power system and discusses the consequences of the faults.  Moreover, it also talks about different methods of protection schemes applied for various faults occurred on power system equipment such as transformer, generator, bus, transmission and distribution lines and motors.  Furthermore, different relaying techniques are also discussed briefly which are used extensively throughout the report for explaining the importance of these techniques in fault detection and damage prevention.  SKM power tool is used for simulation purpose.  The simulation result are displayed and explained. Moreover, short circuit calculation and equipment selection method is also discussed in this report.
