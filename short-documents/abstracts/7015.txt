Aquatic invasive species, Eurasian Watermilfoil (EWM) and Curly-leaf Pondweed (CLP), have been dispersing across New York, USA and are threatening the ecosystem of Adirondack Park, a state park with a large forest preserve and heavily frequented by tourists. In this study, the prediction of EWM and CLP invasion across Adirondack Park lakes is modeled using logistic regression (LR) and geographically weighted logistic regression (GWLR) with lake, landscape, and climate variable predictors. EWM presence-absence is found to be best predicted by nearby invaded lakes, human presence, and elevation. The presence-absence of CLP models have similar findings, with the addition of game-fish abundance being important. GWLR increases model performance and prediction, with explained variation of EWM and CLP increasing by 23% and 16% and the percent correctly predicted increasing by 2.6% and 0.9%. The study shows that GWLR, a relatively novel methodology, works better than common LR models for predicting invasion of EWM and CLP across Adirondack Park, and corroborates anthropogenic influences on dispersal of aquatic invaders.
