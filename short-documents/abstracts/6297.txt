A nationwide jurisdictional analysis of drinking water frameworks was conducted to identify the political backdrop for the integration of the EWBS. Canada demonstrates no consistency in drinking water regulations and policies for EWBS application. While it is not possible for all specific contaminants to be monitored, the EWBS has the potential to effectively detect classes of contaminants applicable nationwide. A case study site was investigated for potential use of the EWBS. The general finding indicated that, despite having an advanced plant, unpredicted spills from upstream industries will continue to represent potential hazards for Walpole Island First Nation. Copper was identified as a contaminant of concern for the study site and was applied in behavioural bioassays using Daphnia magna. Three responses were examined upon exposure to varying concentrations of copper and results indicated change in swimming height as the most sensitive response for utility in an EWBS, followed by immobility.
