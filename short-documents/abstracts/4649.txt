Based on the research of a Chinese photographic album in the George Eastman House (GEH) collections, my thesis project involves cataloging the album using The Museum System (TMS) and presenting it through eMuseum at the GEH website: http://www.emuseum.eastmanhouse.org Accessed through the website, the album is titled, Chinese portraits and views under Collections.

This paper elucidates the three parts of this applied project: Research on the album, Cataloging in TMS, and Web presentation through eMuseum. In each section, I have included figures illustrating the specific methods and technologies adopted in the project, which can provide references for researchers doing similar projects in the future. Images published on the GEH website can also provide new opportunities for researchers to make further identifications on the image content, date, photographer, etc.
