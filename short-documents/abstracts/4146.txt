The use of PEVs (Plug-in Electric Vehicles) is fast expanding due to their low energy cost
and low environmental pollution. However, a big hurdle is that PEVs have a short driving
range and long battery charging time even when using supercharging stations. There-
fore, better queuing models are necessary to improve the quality of services using public
charging stations. This thesis develops an approach for estimating various discharging
profiles of PEV batteries considering different regional driving cycles. Each driving cycle
generates a unique discharging profile. These discharging profiles were employed in a
computer model to study recharging process of PEVs in public charging stations. More-
over, a unique utility function is construed which is optimized to minimize the overall
waiting time for consumers and harmonize the queue size in each charging station. This
model uses Toronto downtown area as a case study.
