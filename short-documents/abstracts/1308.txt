    The Strut-and-Tie model (STM) approach evolves as one of the most useful design methods for shear critical structures and for other disturbed regions in concrete structures. The model provides a rational approach by representing a complex structural member with an appropriate simplified truss model. The literature review showed that there is no single unique STM for most design situations encountered. This report summarizes the STM approach and related research as well as the results of linear and nonlinear analysis of a deep beam using SAP2000 and ABAQUS Software.
