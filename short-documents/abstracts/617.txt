    he construction industry is the largest contributor to environmental loading, and while development will require more infrastructure to achieve its goals, this will require more construction and hence more pollution. In order to achieve a sustainable development, the construction industry has to reduce its environmental loading and consumption of energy and raw materials. The methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can help in quantifying the cradle to grave impact of construction on the environment. This study was performed to develop a model that uses LCA methodology to estimate the environmental impact of concrete bridge decks in North America. The model traces the emissions during the life cycle of a concrete bridge deck, and then calculates the impact of these emissions on the environment.

The model traces the emissions during the life cycle of a concrete bridge deck, and then calculates the impact of these emissions on the environment. The model also calculates the energy and raw materials that are consumed during the life cycle of a concrete bridge deck. This model can be used by designers to evaluate alternative bridge deck designs to select the environmentally sound one.
