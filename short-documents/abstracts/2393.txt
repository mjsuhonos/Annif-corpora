    Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been shown to enhance the local radiation dose in tumour mice models. Although AuNPs can be delivered to tumours through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, delivering of AuNP for therapeutic effect has been proven to be challenging. The application of ultrasound and microbubbles (USMB) has been shown to increase the delivery of genetic material, macromolecules, and chemotherapeutic agents. The hypothesis driving this research is that ultrasound and microbubbles can increase uptake of AuNPs in cells. The results suggest that AuNPs, and USMB aid in its delivery to increase cell death upon irradiation. An improvement of ~ 22 fold was observed with the combined treatment compared to radiation only, implying synergism. In addition, USMB and radiation exhibited an increase in cell death. Cell viability was ~3-4% and is dependent on AuNP concentration, shape and location. Further investigation of this concept was done in vivo.
