    This qualitative investigation presents findings from interviews and observations with 6 mothers and 7 children (ages 6 to 8) in Vaughan, Ontario. The purpose of this research study was to examine the rituals and routines in the home environment that impacted children’s attitudes toward reading. By incorporating the perspectives of children, the researcher sought to answer the question of “why” there continues to be a steady decline in positive attitudes amongst primary children. Using a grounded theory approach, the findings suggest that it was not exclusively the rituals and routines which children had that shaped their attitudes. Rather, participants identified distinct principles of motivation, engagement and the roles of peers, siblings and parents as being influential. The findings demonstrate the value of supporting children in locating their own purpose when reading and exploring literacy opportunities as a shared experience.
