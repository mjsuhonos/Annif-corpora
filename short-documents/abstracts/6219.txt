This paper looks at the role that immigrant adolescents play as cultural/language brokers for their families.  Research shows that immigrant adolescents play exceptionally supportive roles as cultural/language brokers for their families during the early years of settlement.  There is limited research examining this phenomenon of cultural brokering by immigrant adolescents in Canada, and perhaps no particular research focusing on Afghan youth.  The paper presents insights from nine Afghan youth who through their cultural/language brokering are important sources of support for their families during settlement.  It will also include a compilation of previous literature on this area.  Despite the struggles of negotiating with their role as cultural/language brokers in the early years, the youth generally shared positive experiences of being able to be a source of assistance for their families.  Additionally, the participants viewed their role as a cultural/language broker to be a part of their familial responsibility
