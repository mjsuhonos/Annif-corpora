    Self-consolidation concrete (SCC) is the latest version of high performance concrete with excellent workability and high resistance to segregation and bleeding. The main objective of this project is to study the rheological properties of SCC incorporating natural and industrial pozzolans (silica fume and metakaolin, repectively) as supplementary cementing materials (SCMs). Use of such pozzolanic materials in the development of environmentally friendly and cost effective SCC can lead to sustainable construction.
    In this project eleven SCC mixtures are developed by incorporating different percentages of silica fume (SF) and metakaolin (MK) as replacement of cement. However, the water cement ratio of all SCC mixtures are optimized so that all mixtures satisfied the requirements of SCC in terms of fresh properties such as workability, stability, passing ability, bleeding and segregation resistance.
    This study particularly concentrates on evaluation of the rheological properties such as viscosity and yield stress of developed silica fume and metakaolin based SCC mixtures. The influence of SF and MK dosages on viscosity and yield stress of SCC mixtures are evaluated. Correlations among fresh and rheological properties are developed and critically reviewed to make recommendations.
