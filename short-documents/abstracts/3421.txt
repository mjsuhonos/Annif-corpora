In this study, the extent to which African heritage is important in the schools under the Toronto District School Board is explored using the anti-racism and social constructivism frameworks. Phenomenology guided the research process and open ended questions were used to collect data. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. The major findings indicate that some of the needs of students of African descent were met through: identity affirmation; the integration of the African experience; reinforcement of culture and connectedness. The study contributes to anti-oppressive practices which stipulate that social programs and services should respond to multiple forms of oppression. Several recommendations that could potentially improve the program were made. These recommendations are: community based curriculum development and program delivery; the need for comprehensive government funding of the program and the need for the program to address contemporary gaps in skills development.
