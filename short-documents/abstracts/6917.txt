Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that is increasingly considered for use in the sports media space. With the proliferation of digital media, stakeholders in the sports ecosystem are looking to leverage new technology as part of their distribution strategy. This paper will seek to investigate the potential for virtual reality as a sports broadcasting medium.                                                                                                                                                                                        
Through an exploration of various points of view in the field, use cases, and theoretical frameworks, this research will attempt to understand the various barriers to mainstream adoption. This MRP concludes that virtual reality for sport viewing is still in its infancy, but will pervade the market as a complementary broadcasting offering in the future. It will furthermore seek to outline a business model for virtual reality sports to monetize content.
