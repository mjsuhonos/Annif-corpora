A compartmentalization and in-suite ventilation system (ISVS) retrofit strategy was investigated for an existing high-rise residential building in Vancouver. Computer simulation using EnergyPlus™ was used to examine the impact of the proposed retrofit on heating energy and GHG emissions for the building’s original 1983 condition, and its current condition which incorporates a 2012 enclosure retrofit. Results show annual heating energy decreased by 51% and overall GHG emissions decreased by 29% for the proposed retrofit applied to the building in its current condition. When applied to the building in its original condition, heating energy decreased by 49% and overall GHG emissions decreased by 21%. The main benefit of the proposed retrofit, however, is improved effectiveness of the mechanical ventilation system. Because building enclosure air-tightness improvements can negatively impact air distribution in buildings with
pressurized corridor ventilation systems, the proposed retrofit should be applied in combination with, or before, an enclosure retrofit.
