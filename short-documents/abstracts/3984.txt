This study proposes a novel technique to synthesize functional carbonaceous three-dimensional (3-D) micro/
nanocompounds from agricultural by-products using femtosecond laser irradiation. Biowastes of rice husk and
wheat straw are value-engineered to carbonaceous structures in a single-step process under ambient conditions.
Our results demonstrate that by controlling the laser fluence, structures with a variety of different morphologies
from nanostructures to microstructures can be achieved. Also, the results indicate that altering the laser processing
parameters influences the chemical composition of the synthesized structures. This sustainable approach presents
an important step towards synthesizing 3-D micro/nanofibrous compounds from biowaste materials. These
structures, as-synthesized or as nanocomposite fillers, can have practical uses in electronic, sensing, biological, and
environmental applications.
