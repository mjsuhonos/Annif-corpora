The use of the internet has increased significantly with the continued increase in wireless communication devices. Recently, there is a large number of research contribution focused on Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). Multi-homing is an important feature of SCTP which improves the communication performance by usage of multiple paths during association establishment, and it can bring significant improvements of throughput. 

In this thesis we evaluate the performance of SCTP and TCP traffic in the WLANs and we investigate the SCTP multi-homing to improve the communication performance in WLANs. We conducted some experiments to evaluate the performance of SCTP multi-homed host under various channel bit rates and mobility speeds. The results indicate that when the intensity of background traffic increases the SCTP multi-homed host with higher channel bit rate has better performance. In addition, the SCTP multi-homed host with using lower mobility speed has higher performance (throughput, delay and packet loss).
