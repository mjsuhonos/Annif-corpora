    Vancouver, British Columbia is a very attractive place to live for many reasons, but the high cost of housing in this beautiful city has become a threat to the future prosperity of the region. As housing prices continue to rise and become less attainable to low and medium income earners, innovative strategies to provide new supply of affordable housing will need to be implemented.
    The paper outlines a variety of housing solutions that have already had success in the Vancouver area and elsewhere. Case studies are brought together in this document to highlight the potential that combining and replicating successful housing models can have for Vancouver. Through creative solutions and strong partnerships, Vancouver can become a world leader in innovative housing provision in the face of extreme market conditions and land constraints.
