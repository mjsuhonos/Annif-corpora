    A voltage-mode transmitter using a 1.8V-to-3.3V levelshifter and cascoded output buffer is proposed. 1.8V TSMC 65nm transistors are used. The design is targeted to meet JEDEC Interface Standard for Nominal 3 V/3.3 V Supply Digital Integrated Circuits DC Specifications as well as an AC transmission rate of 200 MHz on a 30 cm 50Î© board trace terminated with a 4 pF capacitive load. Overstress voltages will not be exceeded in order to avoid device failure due to breaching Gate Oxide Integrity, Hot Carrier Injection, or Negative Bias Temperature Instability.
