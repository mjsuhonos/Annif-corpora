Atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) and meteorological parameters were monitored
at two sites in downtown Toronto, Canada from Oct. 2015 to Oct. 2016 using Tekran 2537A
mercury vapour analyzers. The average concentration was found to be 1.78 ± 0.89 ng/m3 for Kerr
Hall North (KHN) and 1.46 ± 0.54 ng/m3 for Jorgenson Hall (JOR) site. Analysis of the data reveals
that sporadic events of high mercury concentration are related to local sources.
Comparing this data set with that collected in 2004 revealed that the average atmospheric GEM
concentration in downtown Toronto dropped from 4.5 ng/m3 to 1.78 ng/m3. Decreases in GEM
were also observed over the same period in rural areas as measured by CAMNet. The decrease
might be a result of policy change, as three key national and provincial environmental policies
have been enacted since 2004.

The data collected in Toronto suggest GEM concentration and distribution are influenced by local
and regional sources, meteorological conditions, and changes in environmental policy.
