This thesis presents a powerful numerical fitting procedure for generating Embedded Atom Method (EAM) inter-atomic potentials for pure Face Centred Cubic (FCC) and Body Centred Cubic (BCC) metals. The numerical fitting procedure involves assuming a reasonable parameterized form for a portion of the EAM potential, and then fitting the remaining portion to select thermal and elastic properties of the metal. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation is used to effect the fitting procedure. The procedure is used to generate an EAM potential for copper, an FCC metal. This resulting EAM potential is used to conduct MD simulations of perfect copper crystals containing voids of different geometries. Following this, a bridged Finite Element-Molecular Dynamics (FE-MD) method is presented, which can be used to simulate large atomic systems much more efficiently than MD simulation alone. The method implements a novel element discretization scheme proposed by the author that is so general that it can be applied to any system of objects interacting with each other via any potential (simple or complex, EAM or otherwise). This bridged FE-MD method is used to reanalyze the voids in the copper crystal lattice. The resulting virial stress increment patterns are found to agree remarkably with the earlier MD simulation results. Furthermore, the bridged FE-MD method is much quicker than the pure MD simulation. These two facts prove the power and usefulness of the bridged FE-MD method, and validate the proposed element discretization scheme
