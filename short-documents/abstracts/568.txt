    The Job Search Workshops (JSW) program is a component program within the Immigrant Settlement and Adaptation Program (ISAP), which is funded by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), and offered across Ontario. About half of the JSW participants in Ontario speak Mandarin as their first language. Their settlement needs share many similarities with other immigrant cohorts, yet some of the barriers identified among Mandarin speaking newcomers are culturally specific. Generally, Mandarin-speaking newcomers highly endorse Job Search Workshops; however, there is room for improvement. Improvement of the effectiveness of current settlement programs (sucah as the JSW program) to assist this group of newcomers, will greatly speed up their social, economic and cultural integration into Canadian society.
