An exploratory research investigation into the creation of ‘privately owned publicly accessible spaces’ (POPS) in Toronto, Ontario and a critical review of the process used to secure these spaces and the subsequent agreements made. This paper seeks to answer if land use planners are able to better mediate the use of POPS as a means of providing open space to communities in high-density areas. This report includes the timeline illustrating the development of Toronto’s POPS program followed by a discussion on Toronto’s increase growth and development and the suitability of POPS as a contributing strategy for diminishing new park and open space assets and a high level breakdown of the legal mechanisms currently in place to help facilitate new POP spaces. Interviews with individuals from both the public and private sectors were conducted, which produced a generalized model outlining how POPS in Toronto are secured.
