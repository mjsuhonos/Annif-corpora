The purpose of this study is to explore the value of conducting auctions on-line as a method of raising funds for charity organizations. We review the relevant literature on auctions, in both on-line and live formats and find that there remain numerous unanswered questions for charities considering this funding mechanism. In this exploratory study we collect and compare bid and selling information from eBayâ€™s standard and charity sites and conclude, surprisingly, that the auction clearing prices for comparable items are higher on the non-charity site.
