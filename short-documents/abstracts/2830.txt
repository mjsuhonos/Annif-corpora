This report analyzes the governance of large scale public transit infrastructure planning in the GTA. To accomplish this goal a comparative case study was carried out of the two most recent large scale public transit infrastructure provision plans in Toronto, the Network 2011 plan, and following iterations; and the Transit City aspects of the Big Move plan and subsequent iterations. Each case study consists of (1) a review of the history of each plan and (2) a review of the efficiency of the many iterations of the original plan within each case study. Through analysis of this data several characteristics of governance were associated with movement towards better and worse iterations from an efficiency perspective. These characteristics were used to inform recommendations regarding the future of transportation governance in the GTA.
