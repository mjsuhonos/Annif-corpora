    A modeling study was conducted on the transformation and deposition patterns of atmospheric mercury in the Canadian Arctic. One Dimensional (1-D) local scale model was used to simulate the episodic depletions of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) after polar sunrise at Alert, Canada. The model was developed by starting with existing meteorological model (LCM-Local Climate Model) which is coupled with Canadian Aerosol Module (CAM) and then adding modules specific to atmospheric mercury chemistry. The model is able to simulate local scale transport of mercury over the entire depth of the troposphere with a basic time step of 20 min. and incorporates current knowledge of transformation reactions of atmospheric mercury species. Three mercury species Hg(O), Hg(II) and Hg(p) were considered. The developed model was applied to a portion of the Canadian Arctic region, Alert, for the month of April 2002. The model was then evaluated by comparing model estimates of mercury species concentrations with the measurement data collected in the Canadian Arctic by Meteorological Services of Canada, Downsview, Ontario. The results from this modeling study agree reasonably well with some underestimation caused by lower conversion of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) into reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) and subsequent conversion to total particulate mercury (TPM). A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to examine the depositions of mercury species in response to changes in ozone and soot concentrations.
