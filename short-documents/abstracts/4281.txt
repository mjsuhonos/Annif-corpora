This thesis documents and analyses my research and design that led to the synthesis of a new philosophy called
Journey Architecture, the basis of my design work. Journey Architecture utilises movement and emotion to enhance the
human experience through constant change. A series of design explorations build the understanding that a journey
is never about the end point but rather the creation of a framework of objects, spaces and places to be experienced
uniquely by each individual. Through an iterative process of multi-media techniques, methods for representing ideas,
both visually and temporally, are illustrated. The final design project, the Dwelling of Walt Whitman, is a representation of a Journey Architecture. The dwelling celebrates life within the spaces by recognising that memory and emotion directly impact our experience of an environment. This thesis removes the limitations of architectural conventions and explores architectural ideas that enhance the continuously changing world around us.
