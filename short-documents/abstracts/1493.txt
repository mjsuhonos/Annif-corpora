    The two most commonly used methods of treatment monitoring and prediction in thermal therapy are the temperature threshold method and the cumulative equivalent minutes at 43°C (CEM43) thermal dose model. A newly introduced thermal dose model, the improved cumulative equivalent minutes at 43°C (iCEM43), has been preliminary shown to be more consistent than the CEM43 thermal dose model.
    Data from an ongoing clinical trial for laser treatment of low-grade prostate cancer was used to test the consistency of all three methods. Firstly, threshold values required to match the post-treatment damage were predicted and the iCEM43 dose model was more consistent than the CEM43 dose model, while the temperature threshold method was the most consistent. Secondly, a threshold value was chosen for each method and the damage was predicted and compared to the known damage where the iCEM43 dose model outperformed both the CEM43 dose model and the temperature threshold method.
