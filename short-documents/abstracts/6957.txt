This paper examines the invisible role of immigrant women in their families’ settlement in
Canada. The majority of immigrants in Canada are women, whose traditional and newly
accepted family roles and duties in the receiving country make a significant contribution to
settlement of their husbands and children. This study demonstrates that women’s physical,
financial, social and emotional support helps their family members to adapt to the new
environment smoother. Newcomer women often delay their own settlement for the sake of
their families’ well-being. Studies of immigrant women’s significant contribution to their
families’ settlement would allow to develop effective settlement programs to facilitate
settlement of whole families.
