This qualitative study explored how well prepared first year teachers feel in teaching children with disabilities in the regular classroom. Six elementary school teachers, recent graduates from Faculties of Education in Ontario were interviewed. Findings indicate that the teachers in this study do not feel that their pre-service education program prepared them for the reality of teaching students with disabilities in the regular classroom, and that they will need to look to their School Board for further training. In addition, many feel that they lack the knowledge necessary to design and implement an IEP. The importance of further preparation for first year teachers to work with students with IEPs is discussed and explored.
