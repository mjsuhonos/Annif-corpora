The Grid is the underlying construct that organizes and plots Torontoâ€™s urban fabric. While its penchant for simplicity and unification is successful at the urban level, it reinforces moments of isolation at the architectural level. But as contemporary society becomes more complex and pluralistic, our architecture should become more indicative of this condition. By exploring the creative potential of a layered and diverse society, we can establish a new framework of order to operate within, one that offers a high degree of variation and integration. We can then begin to uncover new opportunities for enhancing architectural connections and facilitating deeper social interactions.
