Bee populations are directly linked to the sustainability of our environment, as healthy bees are required for viable food production. Habitat loss and fragmentation from rapid urban development are some of the major factors that have led to an alarming decline in recent bee populations. Without bee pollination, our global food supply would diminish immensely leading to shortages and crises that threaten our food security.

This thesis will explore architectural strategies to create dedicated bee habitats within the urban realm. The designs will encompass the crafting of a bee builderâ€™s toolkit, which consist of bee-friendly components that can be adapted to various urban site conditions. It will look at opportunities for integrating bee-friendly habitats within the public sphere. These will create networks of pollination corridors that connect existing fragmented urban green spaces.

This strategy aims to strengthen pollination and pollinator health while stimulating public engagement and awareness of the environment.
