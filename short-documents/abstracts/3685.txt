Financial incentives and property tax rebates are common approaches used to
encourage the preservation and rehabilitation of heritage properties. The use of
these techniques is employed across a number of Ontario municipalities. The
purpose of this paper is to develop an evaluative strategy that can be used to
better understand the process and improve the function of these programs.
Through the review of a number of programs and relevant sources, a model was
developed to allow for program organizers to evaluate and improve their heritage
incentive strategies. This model incorporates both quantifiable indicators to
assess program performance and opportunities for participants to express their
opinions on the program process. The implementation of this program in local
municipalities could provide the opportunity to make evidence based
recommendations to improve the overall function of the heritage incentive
strategy.
