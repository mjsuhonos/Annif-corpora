The carbon nanotube (CNT) was first discovered by Iijima in 1991. Carbon nanotubes have remarkable mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. Aluminum alloys are commonly used in various fields due to low density, good mechanical properties and excellent corrosion resistance. To enhance their strength, aluminum matrix composites reinforced by carbon nanotube have been recently developed.
In the present work, the composite composed of 2 wt.% carbon nanotubes as the reinforcement and aluminum alloy 6061 as the matrix has been studied. It is fabricated by powder metallurgy and friction stir processing (FSP) followed by heat treatment. The main objectives of the research are to characterize the microstructure, mechanical properties as well as deformation behaviors. Optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction test, compression tests, tension tests, fractography and low cycle fatigue tests have been conducted. The prediction model for yield strength and the calculation model for Youngâ€™s modulus are analyzed and discussed.
