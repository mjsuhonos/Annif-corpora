    The free convective heat transfer in a double-glazed window with a between-pane Venetian blind has been studied numerically. The model geometry consists of a two-dimensional vertical cavity with a set of internal slats, centred between the glazings. Approximately 700 computational fluid dynamic solutions were conducted, including a grid sensitivity study. A wide set of geometrical and thermo-physical conditions was considered. Blind width to cavity width ratios of 0.5, 0.65, 0.8, and 0.9 were studied, along with three slat angles, 0ยบ (fully open, +/- 45ยบ (partially open), and 75ยบ (closed). The blind to fluid thermal conductivity ratio was set to 15 and 4600. Cavity aspects of 20, 40, and 60, were examined over a Rayleigh number range of 10 to 10โต, with the Prandtl number equal to 0.71. The resulting convective heat transfer data are presented in terms of average Nusselt numbers. Depending on the specific window/blind geometry, the solutions indicate that the blind can either reduce or enhance the convective heat transfer rate across the glazings. The present study does not consider radiation effects in the numerical solution. Therefore, a post-processing algorithm is presented that incorporates the convective and radiative influences, in order to determine the overall heat transfer rate across the window/blind system.
