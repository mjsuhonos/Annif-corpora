    Background: Epidemiological studies show a high incidence of falls and demonstrate that they cause serious consequences to individual health and quality of life, as well as significant social and healthcare impacts. The literature shows that poor balance is a major cause of falls, and emphasizes the need for valid and effective balance diagnostics and risk assessment of falls and balance impairments. The literature review also indicates that arm movements have a potentially significant effect on balance.
    Conclusions: This study shows that the proposed accelerometer-based tests provide useful diagnostic information for postural balance and arm movements evaluation. These devices provide valuable diagnostics information, data for progress monitoring during balance training, and consequently enhance risk assessment and falls prevention. Finally, the study shows the important impact of arm movements on dynamic balance and provides an insight into dynamics of the arm movements and balance maintenance.
