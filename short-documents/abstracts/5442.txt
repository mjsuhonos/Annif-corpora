This major research paper investigates the corporate blog as a tool for strategic communication. Using Erving Goffman’s Self‐Presentation Theory, it draws parallels between the use of a blog and the strategic presentation of self as outlined in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life and the communication tactics used by Rogers Communication and Radian6. It ultimately concludes that each company communicates key messaging differently based on their presumed objectives for the medium.
