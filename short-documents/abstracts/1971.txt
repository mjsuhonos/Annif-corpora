    Serving the movement of people and goods, infrastructures of mobility guide city growth, by framing and connecting sites to accommodate new development. For decades, infrastructures of mobility have inspired architects to explore how forms of growth could be achieved in architecture.
    Based on the research of relevant precedents, this thesis strategizes how architecture can (i) emulate, (ii) hybridize with, and (iii) liberate from types of infrastructure, as a means of serving a more prioritized role in guiding city growth. These strategies inform a design proposal that encourages a method of architectural growth in Torontoâ€™s Don Lands.
