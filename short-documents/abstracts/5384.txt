It remains unclear if mature consumers (particularly baby boomers) in Eastern countries have similar physiological, social and psychological needs when it comes to fashion shopping and consumption. The objectives of this study are: (1) to provide in-depth information regarding the attitudes of female baby boomers in Taiwan toward aging and clothing choice; (2) to understand how female baby boomers in Taiwan behave in different contexts (work-related, social and leisure activities) of clothing usage and consumption; and (3) to identify the differences between the Taiwanese boomers and Western boomers by comparing the current findings to previous research conducted in Western societies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 female participants aged from 47 to 59 years old. Although participants were experiencing physiological, social and psychological change during the aging process, the majority of the participants expressed the willingness to stay healthy and active in their social life. It is also evident that clothing selection and consumption were closely associated with individualâ€™s profession, social status and daily activities. The sample of this study was limited to specific segment (middle to upper-class) which may not represent the diverse baby boomer populations in Taiwan. Nevertheless, this unique study should provide valuable information of aging population and clothing consumption in Taiwan to fashion practitioners, marketers and academia.
