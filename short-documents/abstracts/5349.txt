With the growing interest to understand knowledge mobilization (KMb) and knowledge brokering in practice, this Major Research Paper investigates the viewpoints of knowledge mobilization experts, researchers, intermediaries, and practitioners regarding priority KMb activities, and the competencies and skills required for such tasks. This mixed methods study employed Q-Methodology, with data collected in two major phases. First, expert interviews were conducted with 20 KMb experts from Canada and the UK to develop the studyâ€™s concourse and subsequent q-statements. Second, 91 participants completed an online Q-survey, with a Q-sort task with 49 q-statements and an activity-rating task with 31 activities. Respondents also answered a range of open-ended questions pertaining to their KMb work, training, and perspectives. A crucial component of this research is the use of the Great Eight Competencies Framework, also known as the Universal Competencies Framework (UCF). Analysis identified four distinct approaches to KMb and puts forward a preliminary hierarchy of KMb competencies, according to the survey responses. The proposed hierarchy advances current understandings of KMb in demonstrating commonalities in competencies across various professions and fields. KMb practitioners and researchers are encouraged to respond and refine this initial list of priority competencies according to their workplace and/or research contexts.
