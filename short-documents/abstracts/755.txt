    Canada's international image needs to be recast and enhanced. There are indications that her image does not reflect her achievements in science, technology and industry. Outdated and inaccurate perceptions of Canada in the world can have negative implications for her economic well-being as well as her ability to effectively participate in world affairs and international development.
    The thesis considers whether Radio Canada International (RCI) can help in producing an appropriate image of Canada and serve her national and international objectives. It scrutinizes the organization, present state and past performance of RCI as well as contextualizing the broadcaster within certain social and political trends in the country.
    The thesis concludes that RCI can help Canada in realizing her potential as a valuable player on the world stage and suggests that it should be assigned additional broadcasting responsibilities to this end.
