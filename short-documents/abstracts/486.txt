    At the beginning of the 21st century, there seems to be a global shift in paradigms of identity and belonging. For a long time, both of these entities have been deemed to be fixed and one-dimensional, tied to a specific nation, state and territory. But, under the influence of globalization, notions of identity and belonging are undergoing some fundamental changes. In the interconnected and migratory world we are living in, transnational communities possess and nurture identities of multiple belonging. These global interconnections create new challenges for previous notions of exclusive belonging to a single state-territory, and by extension, citizenship as the ultimate form of political belonging to a nation-state. In this context, dual citizenship has emerged as a legal recognition of this situation. In this paper, I discuss various issues connected to dual citizenship and argue for the need for recognition of full dual citizenship by every country of the world.
