A new differential time-based architecture for use in serial communication data links is
presented in this thesis, the main idea of which involves transmitting the difference between the
input clock signal and the data signal to the receiver. A time to digital converter (TDC) is then
used to demodulate the data from the differential pulse position modulated signal.

The proposed design substantiates an improvement in the bandwidth and simplifies the
circuit complexity of the currently used serializer de-serializers (SerDes). Additionally, a feature
of testability that covers different stuck-at faults was proposed to be implemented in the
transmitter side of the proposed architecture. The complete proposed design was tested in TSMC
65 nm CMOS technology; it achieved a data rate of 10 Gbps running at the input clock
frequency of 1.25 GHz. Moreover, a complete study of different components of a time mode
transceiver architecture was performed during which different design implementation of TDC
and phase locked loop (PLL) were thoroughly investigated. Last but not the least, different
factors that are mainly imposed by the communication channel that affect the signal integrity
were studied, and various methods both from a signal and a circuit point of view were
investigated.
