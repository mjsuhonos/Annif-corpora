    The reduction and degradation of total organic carbon (TOC) and bacteria inactivation efficiency using Vacuum-Ultraviolet (VUV) oxidation process Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) photolytic process, and their combination (UV-C/VUV and VUV/UV-C) from synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater was investigated. TOC removal rates achieved during continuous mode operation were 6.2%, 5.5%, 5.8%, and 6.1%, respectively. In a second stage, H₂O₂ was added to both processes, UV-C/H₂O₂ and VUV/H₂O₂, and it was found that TOC removal rates were increased twice as much during continious flow operation to 10.8% and 12.2%, respectively. The optimum molar ration of H₂O₂/TOC was found to be 2.5 and 1.5 for each process respectively. Finally, it was observed that all photochemical processes achieved over 99.999% (five logs) of bacteria inactivation in a short period of irradiation time, 27.6 sec.
