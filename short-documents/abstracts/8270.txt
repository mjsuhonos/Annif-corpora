The objective of this thesis is to develop a precast and prestressed concrete design for a factory hall, which was initially planned as a steel structure. Furthermore, a structural analysis is conducted on several chosen structural elements according to the European Standards and the German Annexes respectively. The analysis is done both by manual calculation and software calculation for comparison and includes the ultimate limit state design, the serviceability limit state design and the design for the state of transportation and assembly of the precast members. Lastly, to illustrate the results of the analysis, an overview drawing with the new concrete design as well as formwork and reinforcement drawings for each of the analyzed structural members are developed.
