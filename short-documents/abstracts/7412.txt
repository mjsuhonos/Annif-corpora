Over the last 15 years or so, Canadian social enterprises have consistently identified lack of access to financing as an important barrier to their growth and sustainability (e.g., Bridge & Corriveau 2009; Mulholland et al 2011; Treurnicht 2011; McIsaac & Moody 2013; Malhotra et al. 2010; Flatt et al. 2013; CTFSF 2010). Social enterprises in other jurisdictions have echoed a similar complaint (e.g., SEUK 2011, 2013). The same period has also witnessed the emergence of “social investment markets” in several jurisdictions. Social investment markets offer the promise of providing social enterprises and other social purpose organizations with the types and amount of financing they need, outside of mainstream commercial markets.
