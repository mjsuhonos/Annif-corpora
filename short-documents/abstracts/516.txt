    A project is presented to study the Global Positioning System and learn how to apply wavelet analysis to mitigate the effects of multipath errors on GNSS signals. The analysis is carried out using the SystemC language to demonstrate how one may try to implement the GPS signal wavelet filter in hardware. Wavelet analysis, the SystemC library and additional tools are discussed in detail. Design issues such as control signaling and position estimation are explained. System evaluation is performed at two levels, one using cross correlation of signals and the second by measuring the amount of clustering in position plots.
