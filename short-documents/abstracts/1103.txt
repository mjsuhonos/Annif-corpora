    Head-Up-Display (HUD) for automobiles is a system that displays the driving information such as the speed, fuel level, turning signal, GPS, etc on the windshield or on the road through a virtual image. With HUD, the driver does not need to lower his head to check the front panel for driving information and thus the driver can have a longer eyes-on-road time to improve the driving safety and comfort. LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Display) based HUDs dominate today's automotive HUD market. In this thesis, a novel micromirror laser vector scanning HUD is developed for automobiles, which has the advantages over existing technologies including: 1) Higher brightness and contrast; 2) Wider angle of view; 3) Smaller size; and 4) Lower cost.
