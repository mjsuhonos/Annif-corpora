With the rise of sea-levels, rapid urban development and a lack of basic infrastructure, Jakarta, Indonesia, is one of the many Southeast Asian cities suffering the global issue of flooding. The government has begun a project to minimize flooding by dredging and channelizing 15 waterways in the city, resulting in the eviction of tens of thousands of informal settlements. This thesis calls for a more appropriate solution for residents in order to continue their lives safely in the kampung, free from the harmful effects of flooding. The Bamboo Bridge is proposed as a family of bridges extending across the floodplain of the Ciliwung River. It connects kampungs to create access and mobility, and protect residents from the limitations of urban flooding. As flooding increases, Jakarta faces the potential of pockets of lowlying urban areas permanently flooded. The city must prepare for possible life in water.
