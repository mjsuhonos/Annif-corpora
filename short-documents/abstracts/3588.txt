Post-operative coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients require educational interventions to support recovery and prevention of surgical complications. However, the effectiveness of these interventions is questionable, as stress related to the hospitalization process can result in increased levels of anxiety that may impact on the success of the education. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between anxiety and the achievement of knowledge, use of self-care behaviours, and management of symptoms. A descriptive correlation design was used, which included a convenience sample. Results indicate statistically significant correlations between anxiety and the outcomes of interest. Implications for practice include provision of educational interventions at times when anxiety levels are low.
