    Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is known for its excellent deformability, high resistance to segregation and bleeding and can be obtained by incorporating viscosity modifying agents (VMA). Identifying and proposing a new low-cost VMA, and developing and testing the fresh and mechanical properties of such a concrete are essential. This thesis presents the performance of four new polysaccharide-based VMAs in enhancing the rheological and fresh properties of cement paste, mortar and concrete. An experimental study on the structural properties of two SCC and one normal concrete (NC) mixtures with varying proportions of coarse aggregate content (713-1030 kg/m 3  ) and maximum aggregate size (12 and 19-mm) is presented. Eighteen reinforced concrete beams were tested to study the comparative shear resistance of SCC and NC. Sixteen SCC and NC filled steel tube columns with and without additional steel reinforcement were tested. A design equation for peak load capacity of CFST columns is proposed and validated.
