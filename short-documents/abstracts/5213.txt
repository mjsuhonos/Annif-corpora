This paper provides a detailed assessment of FON and Meraki approaches to extending broadband infrastructures by sharing connections within communities. The paper outlines elements of good broadband infrastructure, and considers the extent to which each approach is able to deliver good service to its users. Both approaches have had some success, but the Meraki approach appears to be more feasible. Neither approach is able to build highly robust broadband infrastructure. It is concluded that community-led initiatives to develop large scale infrastructures, while promising in some respects, face many challenges.
