The recent changes to the Canadian Point System in relation to the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) have greatly impacted the types of applicants that will be admitted to Canada. Through a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), it is my intention to explore the hiring practices of some Canadian employers and how immigrants
currently fare in the labour market. A CDA will also be conducted based on the adjustments to the point distribution of specific selection factors for the FSWP. Because the most recent changes to the Point System were made in May 2013, this MRP will be one of the first if not the first to critically assess the May 4, 2013 changes to the Point System from a rights-based perspective. I will also explore whether or not the Government takes responsibility for helping immigrants facing discrimination in the labour market. Finally, I will investigate whether the adjustments to the Point System reinforces and legitimates the discriminatory practices of some Canadian employers.
