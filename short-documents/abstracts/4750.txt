The Midwifery Trained Registered Nurse (MTRN) is a part of the multi- disciplinary team of hospital based maternity care in Sri Lanka. MTRNs perform their duties by practice or tradition without clear job descriptions, thus exposing them to role conflicts within the team similar to other South Asian settings (Sharma, Johansson, Prakasamma, Mavalankar & Christensson, 2013). The MTRN´s scope of practice therefore needs to be carefully analysed in order to clarify their role, tasks and responsibilities. This study explores MTRN´s perceptions of their own profession as maternity care providers
