    Research addressing innovation performance in the Canadian biotech industry has primarily addressed financial metrics and not the influence of organizational culture.  The lack of research on biotech organizations in terms of culture presented a "gap" in the research.  An innovation performance model was developed based on the existing literature and the theorized linkages between constructs.  The key addition to the conceptual model was the construct of organizational culture.  The key addition to the conceptual model was the construct of organizational culture.  The Competing Values Framework of Cameron and Quinn (1999) was the theoretical framework selected as the lens through which to explore the impact of culture on innovation performance, defined in terms of aggregate organizational patent output.  Overall, based on the results of this research, the dominant culture generated greater innovation performance.  Although, several constructs in the research model reached significance, organizational culture had a weak association with innovation performance.
