    With the emergence of wireless devices, service delivery for mobile as hoc networks (MANET) has started to attract a lot of attention recently. We believe that overlay networks, particularly peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, is a good abstraction for application design and deployment over ad hoc networks. The principal benefit of this approach is that application states are only maintained by the nodes involved in the application execution and all other nodes only perform networking related functions. We propose a P2P system for MANET, RAON, which performs query forwarding and overlay topology adaptation based on link instability and power constraints. We evaluated and compared the performance of RAON with an existing P2P system, Gia. Our simulation results show that RAON improves the success rate and delay of query search as compared to Gia. It, however, achieves this at the expense of higher energy consumption.
