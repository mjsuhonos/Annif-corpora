    his study examines inclusive education within Guyana for children with special needs (0-8 years), from the perspectives of policy makers, teachers and parents of children with special needs (N=22). The study is framed within a constructivist perspective, and uses a grounded theory design and analysis. Findings indicate four factors which are potential barriers to implementing inclusive education in Guyana: attitudes / perceptions toward those with special needs, change agents, resources and experiences with children with special needs. This study describes the interrelating relationsips among the core phenomenon (i.e. attitudes towards those with special needs), and other conditions (i.e., change agents, resources and experiences with children with special needs). The interrelationship between these factors stimulates strategies or actions. These lead to consequences which prevent sustainable and successful inclusive education within Guyana. There is a discussion of recommendations and conclusions which may assist in supporting inclusive education within Guyana.
