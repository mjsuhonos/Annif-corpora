This thesis proposes a single and scalable web-based model for grid resource discovery for the Internet. The proposed resource discovery model contains the metadata and resource finder web services. The information of resource finder web services is kept in the repositories that are distributed in the application layer of [sic] Internet. The resource finder web services will be discovered by sending queries to the repositories in a similar way as the DNS protocol. The underlying technology for implementation of the two architectures of this model is introduced.
