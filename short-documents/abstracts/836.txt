    Traffic congestion is an existing problem in North Toronto with Highway 401 and other area roads operating at capacity during peak hours. Future population and employment growth across north Toronto will increase traffic demands in the area. With many roads already operating at capacity, alternative non-auto modes of transportation will be required to accommodate future traffic demands and minimize future traffic congestion. Public transit is the best means of providing a non-auto transportation mode in north Toronto. Higher-order rapid transit can offer travel-time savings and many other benefits over auto-travel in congested conditions; however, no rapid transit service presently exists across north Toronto.
    This paper provides the rationale for a north Toronto rapid transit line and confirms its feasibility for its implementation.
