    Presented in this thesis is a method for tool-path planning for automated polishing.  This work is an intergral part of the research program on automated polishing/deburring being carried out at Ryerson University.  Whereas tool-path planning for machining is treated as a geometry problem, it ks shown here that tool-path planning for polishing should be treated as a contact mechanics problem because of the contact action between the polishing tool and the part surface.  To develop this algorithm, contact mechanics is applied for contact area modeling and analysis,  Once the contact area is determined, for multiple contact points along the given polishing path, a map of the contact area is generated and utilized to show the coverage area during polishing.  This map is then used to plan a polishing path that ensures complete coverage for polishing,  Simulation has been carried out to show the effetiveness of this new polishing path algorithm.
