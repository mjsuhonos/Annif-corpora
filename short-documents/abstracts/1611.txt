    The purpose of this thesis is to propose a model for a collections policy for the Photographic and Digital Archives of the National Library in Chile. The current policy is in its early stages of development and the institution has a large interest in its implementation. The main focus of this research is collections policies, as a form of generating best practice in the field, and a vehicle to implement institutional mission, vision, and objectives from a theoretical and practical perspective.
