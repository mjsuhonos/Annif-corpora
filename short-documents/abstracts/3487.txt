Canada's vast landscape has produced challenges in providing equitable access to healthcare for those living in rural and remote areas.  Over several decades physician shortages have increasingly compromised rural communities' access to medical services.  In response, provinces and territories have recruited international medical graduates (IMGs) to address these shortages.  Synthesizing literature and frameworks from American, Australian and Canadian sources, this paper will explore issues related to IMG recruitment and retention to rural practice.  Using an evidence-based review of the literature and data from the Canadian Residency Matching Service (CaRMS) this investigation will examine the profiles of IMGs who voluntarily pursue rural practice in hopes of identifying trends  and future directions for recruitment and retention efforts.
