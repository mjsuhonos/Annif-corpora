    This essay and exhibition proposal explores the importance of stereographs at specific points in the history of photography. It includes a brief analysis of stereographs made by Louis Jules Duboscq-Soleil, Warren Thompson, Carlton E. Watkins, B.K. of Paris, Underwood & Underwood, Keystone View Company, and Nickolas Muray. It addresses the difficulties implicit in the display of stereographs; they require an interactive viewing experience and a stereoscope in order to be viewed in three dimensions by a general audience. The necessity for an interactive viewing experience can risk damage to the objects being displayed and the inclusion of stereoscopes presents technical issues related to human vision and accessibility. This thesis proposes a design for a stereoscope that circumvents some of these issues. Both the stereoscope design and the essay pertain to the possible inclusion of stereographs within the context of the proposed 2010 history of photography survey exhibition at George Eastman House.
