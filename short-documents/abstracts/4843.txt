This paper looks at the role that immigrant children play in translating and interpreting for their parents.  Research shows that children pick up language skills and culture faster than their parents do, so they are often put into the position of translating.  This paper includes previous literature on the subject, and uses interviews and questionnaires conducted with adults who have had experiences in the role of culture brokers as children.  While many of the participants benefited by perfecting language skills and were able to assist their families, they generally did not enjoy their stressful experiences as culture brokers.  Currently, Canada does not have any laws in place to govern this activity, and this research calls for the government to implement limitations to the practice of using children is such a role.
