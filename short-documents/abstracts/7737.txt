When marijuana is legalized in Canada there will be land-use planning implications for municipalities. Different levels of government have different jurisdictional responsibilities regarding the legalization of recreational marijuana. One of the jurisdictional responsibilities of municipalities is land use planning and zoning. Two new land uses will be introduced to municipalities through the legalization of marijuana: recreational marijuana production facilities and recreational marijuana retail stores. For municipalities to control for the location of these uses, the land use legislation they enact must be able to co-exist with federal and provincial/territorial legislation and not result in any operational conflicts. This research paper provides a set of best practices to municipalities across Canada for how they should regulate these uses in their land use legislation.

KEY WORDS: recreational marijuana legalization; marijuana retail stores; marijuana production facilities; land use planning; Canada.
