Developing a Web Video Player connected to a security surveillance camera for collecting the video streams is the main objective of this study. The Developed Web Application tracks the target object through the sequences of video frames and generates the object trajectories. The video frames are analyzed, and the object trajectories are fed into a classifier or clustering method for training and movement detection purposes. In this thesis, several machine learning techniques are applied and implemented in Batch and in Real-Time mode including SVM, J48 Decision Tree, PART, Decision Table, Decision Stump, Multilayer Perceptron, and K-Means clustering by using two customized datasets. The object tracking, and movement detection are based on a simplified HSV color space model. The developed Web Application and proposed architecture are implemented on a local area network with in-house Server as well as a single computer and can detect the trajectories of the moving objects effectively.
