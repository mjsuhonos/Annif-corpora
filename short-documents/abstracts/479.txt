    Existing safety performance functions for mainline interchanges and ramps of Ontario freeways are updated using negative binomial regression. The functional forms of the updated models are different from the existing models. In addition, new safety performance functions for ramp terminal sites are developed.
    Network screening to identify sites in need of safety treatment has been illustrated using two different methods, one based on a potential for safety improvement (PSI) index and, the other based on an index of a high proportion of a specific accident type. A comparison for rankings for 3-legged signalized ramp terminals by the two methods indicates reasonably consistent results, with some key differences. The method of screening for high proportion of specific accidents can be a possible alternative to PSI index method where safety performance functions and/or traffic volumes are not available since, unlike the PSI Index method, it does not require these inputs.
