Toronto is experiencing a trend in which apartment housing lacks the flexibility and adaptability to transform over one’s life cycle. A majority of suites in Toronto’s apartment housing stocks are unsuitable for potential family growth and change to an Echo Boomer’s needs over time due to its static layouts. In light of this phenomenon, how can Toronto’s downtown intensification accommodate the changes and demands in all phases of an Echo Boomer’s life cycle in the ever growing apartment typology? Through analyzing city’s development guidelines, precedent studies and a design proposal to culminate the findings, this thesis envisions a building typology that will enable an architectural response that is flexible to accommodate Echo Boomers over their life cycle.
