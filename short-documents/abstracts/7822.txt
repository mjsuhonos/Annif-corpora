Toronto has a rich history of Missing Middle Housing forms that have contributed to the overall character of the city’s built environment. The research paper maps the locations of Missing Middle Housing in Toronto, which I define as residentially zoned properties between 12 and 36 meters in height. It provides information on the broad development trends of this type of
housing, and explores the forms of Missing Middle Housing in Toronto in the past and present. The research paper indicates that forms of Missing Middle Housing along avenues are being constrained by the City of Toronto’s Mid-Rise Performance Standards (2010), making it challenging to build forms that have shaped Toronto’s past.
