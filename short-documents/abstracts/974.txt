    Among different options available for wind energy system, this research is focused on direct driven Synchronous generator based variable speed wind turbines that are connected to power grid via modular converter units. Compared to single full size power converter, modular design has higher reliability/redundancy, better harmonic performance, lower developmental cost and higher efficiency.
    Better harmonic performance of modular structure is possible through interleaving which effectively reduces ripple in the output current, enabling use of smaller sized filter components. Focus of this research is to design a controller that can perform automatic interleaving of modular three-phase converters used in above cited wind energy system. Developed control algorithm will have critical decisions carried out by local controllers. With minimum communication overhead the controller will ensure interleaved operation of parallel modules under all conditions. Developed control algorithm is verified through simulation and laboratory testing. Results prove effectiveness of the designed controller.
