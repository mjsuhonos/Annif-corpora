    This thesis examines the collection of nitrate negatives produced by the Los Angeles Police Department between the years of 1925 and 1939. The thesis is divided into two sections. The first section contextualizes the collection and explains how a plan was developed for re-photographing, cataloguing, and storing a digital database of the negative collection that will eventually be destroyed. The second section provides a management plan for the collection. Accompanying the management plan is an inventory documenting the current physical condition and the contents of each negative box.
