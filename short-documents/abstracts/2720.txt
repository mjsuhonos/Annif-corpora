The worth of finding a general solution for nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems is specified in many areas of engineering and science computations, such as reducing noise to have a quiet ride in automotive industrial engineering or calculating the natural frequency of a bridge in civil engineering. The main objective of this thesis is to design a hybrid algorithm (based on CPU-GPU) in order to reduce general non-symmetric matrices to Hessenberg form. A new blocks method is used to achieve great efficiency in solving eigenvalue problems and to reduce the execution time compared with the most recent related works. The GPU part of proposed algorithm is thread based with asynchrony structure (based on FFT techniques) that is able to maximize the memory usage in GPU. On a system with an Intel Core i5 CPU and NVIDA GeForce GT 635M GPU, this approach achieved 239.74 times speed up over the CPU-only case when computing the Hessenberg form of a 256 * 256 real matrix. Minimum matrix order (n), which the proposed algorithm supports, is sixteen. Therefore, supporting this matrix size is led to have the large matrix order range.
