The tradition of inherent knowledge and power of health care providers stands in stark contrast to the principles of self-determination and patient participation in patient centered care. At the organizational level, patient centered care is a merging of patient education, self-care, and evidence-based models of practice and consists of 4 broad domains of intervention including communication, partnerships, health promotion, and physical care. As a result of the unexamined discourse of knowledge and power in health care, the possibilities of patient centered care have not been fully achieved. In this article, we employ a critical social theory lens to examine the discursive influence of power upon the integration of patient centered care into health care organizations. We begin with an overview of patient centered care, followed by a discussion of the various ways that it has been introduced into health care organizations. We proceed by deconstructing the inherent power and knowledge of health care providers and shed light on how these long standing traditions have impeded the integration of patient centered care. We conclude with a discussion of viable solutions that can be used to implement patient centered care into health care organizations. This article presents a perspective through which the integration of patient centered care into health organizations can be examined. Keywords: patient centered care, critical social theory, biomedical knowledge, power, health care organization.
