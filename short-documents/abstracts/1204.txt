    This thesis examines how a building can respond to changes in user needs. Specifically, the research component of this publication seeks to understand how and why buildings change, using primarily a typomorphological based approach to the urban condition. Research methods used in this thesis include literature reviews, case studies, and design experimentation. The design portion of this thesis responds by taking a systems approach to architecture that can be used to deal with user issues of program and form over time. The design proposal utilizes a prefabricated system that is comprised of 5 main elements. Combined, these elements produce multiple design opportunities that allow for future changes through the standardization of fabrication and construction techniques. The system is designed for future modifications through modular structure and elements. This allows for the addition, replacement, and upgrade of rooms, floors, walls, or entire buildings as its user needs change.
