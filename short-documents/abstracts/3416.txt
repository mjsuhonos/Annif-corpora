In this research study, I engage in the process of autoethnography to make visible the processes by which the marginalization of Southeast Asian queers are produced. The practice of Whiteness, why and how Southeast Asian queers engage with Whiteness and its implications on the queer Southeast Asian community are the main tenets of this study.  By exploring these processes of marginalization, a space is created to discuss the ways in which Southeast Asian queers resist racism and colonialism.
