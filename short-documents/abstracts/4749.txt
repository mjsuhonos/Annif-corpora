The design experience of 3rd year undergraduates  in  Mechanical  Engineering  at  Ryerson  University, and  the  assessment  of  student  design  work,  was  found  to be disjointed and highly variable across the program. To attempt  to  address  this,  the  authors  are  constructing courseware to help instructors of non-design engineering courses  embed  rich  and  consistent  design projects into their  courses.  A “lightweight”  Fast-Design  process  was developed. Course - specific design project examples of the process  are  being  developed  for  five  3rd year  courses using    this    design    process.    Current    versions    of    all courseware  are  freely available.  This  paper  details  the nature of the courseware and how it was designed, developed, and deployed for the project. 
To date, one case has been  deployed,  two  developed,  and  two  more  are  under development. While  results  are  so  far  only  anecdotal, there is reason to believe that our approach can noticeably  improve  the  design  experience  of  students  in  non-design engineering courses.
