    To take on the challenge for improving the distribution system voltage stability, this thesis research carried out an extensive study of the stability issues and available technology dealing with the stability problems. Load shedding, Load reduction through transformer tap changing, reactive power compensation, and DG control are investigated in detail.
    The new strategies proposed, and formulations presented, in this thesis research, are designed for carrying out the corrective actions against voltage instability with a great degree of feasability to achieve optimal operations. A new concept of composite power was developed in this thesis research, for prediction of the trend of voltage stability, and a novel prediction of voltage stability and consequently determination of corrective actions was formulated.
    A detailed hardware/software based development of the algorithm and strategy for voltage stability enhancement was presented. A detailed set of case studies for verification of the voltage stability enhancement was developed.
