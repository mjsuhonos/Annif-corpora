In the last twenty years, mathematical modelling (MM) has been notably used to capture the infection kinetics of many infectious diseases as it allows insights into the basic biology, infection kinetics, and the mechanisms and efficacy of treatment modalities. MMs of influenza A virus (IAV) infection usually represent the process of virus replication within a cell as a ‘black box’ term for viral production. The simplification is appropriate when we are not interested in the microscopic details of infection. Recently though, MMs have begun to account for the kinetics of intracellular IAV replication. Herein, we examine the MM by Heldt et al., which is able to capture kinetics of IAV infection. It however, does so by adjusting parameters of the MM to various events in the infection process. We developed a robust, yet concise, MM for the intracellular kinetics of influenza A virus infection in vitro with a consistent set of parameters. We use attachment, fusion and RNA data gathered from literature sources to validate our simplified MM and match known infection kinetics consistent throughout infection.
