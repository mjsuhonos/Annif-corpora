    This paper examines the installation of photography exhibitions within the unconventional gallery spaces that have been produced as a part of the relatively recent wave of “iconic” museum architecture. As a medium that has primarily been displayed within the modernist “white cube,” photography presents issues adapting to this new type of gallery interior. This thesis takes, as its case study, the Roloff Beny Gallery, managed by the Institute for Contemporary Culture (ICC) as located in Daniel Libeskind’s Michael Lee-Chin Crystal – a controversial addition to the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM), Toronto, Ontario. It examines how photographic exhibitions have addressed design and installation issues in this iconic space through three photographic exhibitions Hiroshi Sugimoto: History of History,Vanity Fair Portraits: Photographs 1913-2008 andEdward Burtynsky: Oil. This paper proposes that it can be productive to consider the installation ofphotography exhibitions as having affinities with the contextualizing practices of artistic installation.
