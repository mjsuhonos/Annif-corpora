This exploratory, qualitative research study is based on the stories of four refugee women living in the city of Toronto, and looks at their first hand experiences of living without health insurance or coverage, since the 2012 cuts to the Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP). This study ultimately sought to explore how refugeesâ€™ lived experience of barriers to healthcare impacted their overall health and the health of their families. A social constructionist framework was used for analysis, along with the utilization of a gender and race analysis, taking into account an
overall anti-oppressive lens. This research was ultimately concerned with learning about the experiences of this group of people, who, at the time of the research, were being prevented from accessing free health care. A number of conclusions were reached about the impacts of the 2012 cuts to the IFHP and about the need for future research on refugee access to healthcare. Finally, the narratives of the four women refugees in this study revealed 1) pre-existing barriers to health care , 2) the worsening or onset of mental health conditions 3) negative sentiments around
program coverage and 4) that the women still displayed cites of resilience and resourcefulness despite their health care coverage being cut off.
