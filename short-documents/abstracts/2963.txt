This literature review explores the relationship between neighbourhood diversity and
political participation arguing that social capital is well-suited for assessing the political context
created by communities. Emphasis is placed on the Canadian context which is characterized by a
lack of scholarship. Particularly, this review explores how existing studies can explain the impact
of community diversity on political participation and whether immigrants, as a group, are
disproportionately affected by such diversity. This review also outlines how social capital might
be useful in determining how context, such as, diversity, determines individuals' political
behaviours. Generally speaking, this review finds that it is difficult to draw definitive
conclusions regarding the effects of diversity on political participation and that there is an
overwhelming empirical gap in the literature on immigrant political participation.
