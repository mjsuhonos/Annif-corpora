As Toronto's population continues to grow increasingly diverse, park planners will be faced with the challenge of implementing changes to the existing parks and recreational facilities in order to accommodate the leisure needs of these new emerging demographics. This is due to the fact that the existing infrastructure does not meet the needs of these emerging groups. However, further research is needed to understand how emerging multicultural communities use park space and how they manipulate the use of existing infrastructure to accommodate their favoured activities. The research in this study is collected through conducting three focus groups, key informant interviews, and secondary research in regards to prevalent literature and municipal plans, policies, and staff reports regarding park planning. This study will have the capacity to assist planners in developing an understanding of how the changing urban population is using park spaces, as well as their recreational preferences and requirements, in order to adequately provide facilities that accommodate space for their specific needs.
