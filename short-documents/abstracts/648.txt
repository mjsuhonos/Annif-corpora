    Active-passive damping is getting more popular with designers because it combines the complementary passive and active features in the control of structural vibrations. The classical three-layer structure has a viscoelastic-layer sandwiched between the host beam and a piezoelectric-layer.
    The more prevalent assumptions for modeling the system are the use of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for both the host beam and piezoelectric-layer, and Timoshenko beam theory for the viscoelastic-layer. The assumption that transverse displacement is constant through the thickness limits accuracy and applicability of the model. The current formulation expresses the through-the-thickness dependency of the field variables as polynomials while their span dependency across a finite element is cubically interpolated.
    The versatility of the formulation is demonstrated via static and dynamic studies of examples taken from the literature. A beam treated with active-passive damping is presented and examined. The constitutive relation of the viscoelastic layer is represented using fractional derivatives and the Gr√ºnwald approximation. The extended Hamilton's principle is used to derive the system governing equations which are integrated with the Newmark time-integration system.
