This thesis reports the findings of a study conducted on the effects of mixing and curing high performance concrete at elevated temperature. The purpose of the study was to find solutions to ameliorate the strength and durability loss resulting from high temperature environments. This investigation is broken down into two distinct phases. Phase I consisted of a preliminary mortar investigation followed by Phase IIa which was conducted on ready mix concrete and Phase IIb which studied roller compacted concrete. Phase IIa investigated the ability of supplementary cementing materials and chemical admixtures to mitigate the deleterious effects of curing at high temperature. In contrast, Phase IIb investigated the ability of supplementary cementing materials to reduce the deleterious effects. It was found that supplementary cementing materials were moderately effective at ameliorating strength loss, and performed well in reducing durability loss. The chemical admixtures only performed well in ameliorating strength loss.
