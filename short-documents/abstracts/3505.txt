Migrant farm workers are behind-the-scenes backbone of Canada's agricultural economy.  Despite their significant role within the food production industry, the outer public is typically unfamiliar with their contributions, experiences, and even their presence in Canada.  Many researchers agree that workers arriving through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program hold a precarious status, primarily due to the invisibility of their plight to the rest of Canada.  In Leamington, Ontario, large-scale greenhouse operations call for thousands of workers from Mexico and the Caribbean to grow vegetables year-round.  This study sought to gain an understanding of the relationship between migrant workers and community members by surveying and interviewing Leamington residents.  While worker visibility and local familiarity with the presence of migrant workers is heightened in the Essex County region, the quality of social interactions was found to be    severely limited.  The implications were found to involve social marginalization, culture clash, and racial stereotyping.
