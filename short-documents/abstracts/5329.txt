This research paper explores internal communication and focuses on understanding some tactics used to communicate mission statement values with employees. Internal communication is disseminated within organizations to create awareness, foster understanding and offer direction on how to attain corporate goals. Distributing internal communication also ensures a focused workforce. Drawing from communication theory and literature, this study analyzes internal communication practices within a Canadian communications firm. Specifically, email sent from a Director to employees related to mission statement values from March 1, 2011 to April 30, 2011 were analyzed drawing from research done by Cheney (1983b). Findings of this study suggest that within the sample, communication was one-way and controlled, using various styles and tactics to express mission statement values with employees. Future research is called for to investigate the impacts for such a communication model.
