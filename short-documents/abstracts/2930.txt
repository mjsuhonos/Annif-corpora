The contents of this thesis/project summarize thirteen months of research and design into the architecture of human health. Specifically, it examines the problems in Canada's health culture and offers a more sustainable solution with respect to the design of the physical environment. Research includes the interconnected issues of a changing population demographic, alternative therapy, ancient civilizations and their approach to preventative health, as well as the role that evidence based design plays in the modern healing environment. Research methods include literature reviews, case studies, site visits, field research, personal interviews and design experimentation. This thesis/project examines the healthy attributes inherent in nature, and their inclusion in the design of existing corrective health facilities. This thesis/project investigates how these natural features can be incorporated into a proposed Toronto community. The West Donlands Health and Wellness Centre will promote an alternative preventative health lifestyle for its users. Community programming is offered through a holistic definition of health, this includes traditional allopathic health services, education, physical fitness and healing.
