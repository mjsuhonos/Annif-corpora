The main objective of this study is to determine the factors influencing the cloud computing adoption by Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs). Based on two dominant theories in the field of diffusion of innovation, a conceptual model is proposed. In order to test the model empirically, an online survey was designed and launched. Decision makers of 101 SMEs agreed to participate in this survey. In order to evaluate the internal, convergent and discriminant validity of the instrument, factor analysis and reliability tests of panel data were performed. The logistic regression analysis was deployed to test the research hypotheses. The results of regression analysis reveal that decision makerâ€™s knowledge about cloud computing is the main influential factor in adopting this technology. A comparison between two groups of cloud adopters and non-adaptors confirm the recent Gartner's hype cycle model for emerging technology (as discussed in chapter 7) indicating a high expectation from cloud computing in both groups.
