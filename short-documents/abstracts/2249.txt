    High speed data transmission in wireless networks demands better radio resource management schemes. The research work for this thesis considers packet scheduling in downlinks of a cellular CDMA system for delay-tolerant applications. In this thesis, a packet scheduling scheme is proposed that attempts to provide fair allocation of individuals throughout and obtain relatively high system throughput. It is based on combined consideration of channel conditions, required throughput and achieved average throughput. A priority factor and system tolerance factor are introduced. We confirmed the trade-off between system throughout (i.e., efficiency) and individual throughput (i.e., fairness) by both analysis and simulation. Relative performance between the proposed scheme and traditional schemes is evaluated through simulation to confirm the analytical observations. The sensitivity of system tolerance factor towards efficiency and fairness was also investigated. Overall, the proposed scheme performs between absolute unfairness scheme and absolute fairness scheme in term s of system throughput and fair allocation of individual throughput.
