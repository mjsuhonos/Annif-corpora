This thesis focuses on the 19th century albums Photographic Views Taken in Egypt, which hold photographs and text by James Douglas, M.D. (1800-1886) and his son James Douglas Jr. (1837-1918). The albums are held in the collections of the Archive of Modern Conflict (AMC), Toronto, Canada, the British Library, London, England, The Brooklyn Museum’s Wilbour Library of Egyptology Special Collections in Brooklyn, New York City, and Université Laval in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The albums are also identified as Photographic Views Taken in Nubia and Photographic Views of Egypt & Nubia and include views of both Egypt and Nubia. Since the albums were privately printed for friends and family, little research and academic discussion has taken place on them. This thesis strives to resolve this gap in academic discussion and has begun a discourse on Photographic Views Taken in Egypt.
