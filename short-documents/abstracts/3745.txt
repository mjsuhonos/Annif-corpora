The prevalence of dementia is apparent in various ethnicities and is growing within the Canadian South Asian population. However, the notion of resilience in dementia is dismissed as the dominant biomedical view of dementia prevails. There is a need to reframe that discourse to that of a strength-based, resilience approach to uphold the identity and strengths of a person living with dementia. In this narrative analysis of identity development, two participants living with mild stage dementia and one caregiver shared their experiences of challenge and resilience. Participants’ narratives have been re-storied to demonstrate their identity development and reveal their social world, while applying the Resilience Framework and using the intersectionality lens. Findings revealed that resilience for the two participants living with mild dementia meant 1) having purpose and meaningful worth, 2) having a strong sense of faith, 3) having supports that improve quality of life (family and day program), and 4) coming to their own terms with limited “control”. These findings and further emergent meaning derived from the participants’ narratives bear implications for education, practice, policy and future research.
