The first design presents a novel location-based key management and en-route data authentication proposal.  It divides the whole sensing area into a number of location cells.  A group of location cells consist of a logical group.  A pairwise key between two sensor nodes is established based on grid-based bivariate t-degree polynomials.  Any valid reading report needs to collect enough message authentication code (MACs) from different neighbours.  These pairwise keys used for generating the MAC are forwarded several hops down to the base station for future en-route data authentication.
The second design proposes a greedy location-based secure and energy-efficient data aggregation approach.  It further utilizes data aggregation based on the previous design by setting up control groups, applying pattern codes, selecting and switching control head nodes dynamically and periodically.  In addition, different from the first design, it only requires control head nodes to collect enough MACs in each reading report.
Extensive analysis, evaluations and experiments show us that both designs are secure, efficient and resilient.
