    The goal of the present study was to examine interview techniques that can be used with young children with disabilities. Four children aged three to five were recruited at a family resource center affiliated with a university in Toronto and were interviewed twice at their childcare centers. Multiple methods were used in the interviews to examine techniques that worked well with the children. The types and purposes of interview questions were analyzed, and the themes emerged from the interactions between the interviewers and the children were discussed. Overall, this study provides insights to the research methodologies that can be used to investigate the perspectives of young children with disabilities and underscores the importance of listening to this population through multiple ways.
