The objective of this thesis is to analyse the psychometric data using statistical and machine learning methods. Psychological data are analysed to predict illness and injury of athletes. Regression technique, one of the statistical processes for estimating the relationship among variables is used as basis of this thesis. We apply the linear regression, time series and logistics regression to predict illness and well-being. Our linear regression simulation results are mainly used, to understand the data well.                                                                                                                                                      By reviewing the results of linear regression, time series model is developed which predicts sickness one day ahead. The predicted values of this time series model are continuous. However, logistic regression can be used, to provide a probabilistic approach to predict the future levels as a categorical value. Hence we have developed a binomial logistics regression model, when observation variable is the type of dichotomous. Our simulation results show that this prediction model performs well. Our empirical studies also show that our method can act as early warning system for athletes.
