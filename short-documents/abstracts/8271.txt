With advanced technology, the production of strong construction material becomes more feasible. However, use of such materials as repairs on top of existing concrete is challenging, since repair system relies not only on the quality of repair but also on the interaction and compatibility of such material with the substrate. Studies regarding the durability of bond strength are limited. Therefore, the objective of this research is to compare the bond strength and durability performance of advanced cement-based materials including ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC), engineered cementitious composite with slag (ECC-Slag), specialized repair material with self-consolidating properties (SCC), and normal concrete (NC) under two common deterioration modes in Canada (freeze-thaw cycles with de-icing salt, and volumetric expansion of the substrate). The freeze-thaw cycle results show higher bond strength and durability performance for UHPC and NC, respectively. Under expanding deterioration, NC started with higher bond strength and UHPC revealed the best durability performance.
