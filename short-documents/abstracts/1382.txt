    This thesis is focused on the performance of the two SDHW systems of the sustainable Archetype houses in Vaughan, Ontario with daily hot water consumption of 225 litres. The first system consists of a flat plate solar thermal collector in conjunction with a gas boiler and a DWHR. The second SDHW system consists of an evacuated tube collector, an electric tank and a DWHR. The experimental results showed that the DWHRs were capable of an annual heat recovery of 789 kWh. The flat plate and evacuated tube collectors had an annual thermal energy output of 2038 kWh and 1383 kWh. The systems were also modeled in TRNSYS and validated with the experimental results. The simulated results showed that Edmonton has the highest annual energy consumption of 3763.4 kWh and 2852.9 kWh by gas boiler and electric tank and that the solar thermal collectors and DWHRs are most beneficial in Edmonton.
