    The Third Skin project is designed to challenge perception of architectural spaces. The intention of the Third Skin is to define the space as we experience it, before we outline it in a concrete form through the limits of spatial definition and dimension. Cutting through the conventional, fixed and motionless Cartesian grid, the Third Skin project articulates how the sensing of space is rooted in the way that human bodies cross and move within the space. The proposal suggests that experiencing space is fundamentally flowing and we cannot enforce fixity on it. The thesis creates a mental and physical journey of phenomenological experience. The argument is set through theoretical interpretation; it focuses on design process, identifies the journey of exploration, and proposes a new intervention for embodied experience in architectural spaces.
