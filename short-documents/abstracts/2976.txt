Upon arrival to Canada, International Medical Doctors (IDMs) must undergo a lengthy and complex process in becoming accredited in order to be able to practice in this country, IMDs have historically contributed substantially to the Canadian healthcare system and have great potential to tackle the current physician shortages in the provinces. However, although they have significant skills and experience and can be regarded as a fairly obvious resource to address the physician shortage, their potential remains underutilized. Therefore, this major research paper will focus on the province of Ontario to examine some of the barriers IMDs face in their path to re-entering their profession and outline and assess some of the initiatives and programs put forth to tackle some of these challenges faced by IMDs in this province.
