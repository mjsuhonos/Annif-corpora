    This thesis investigates factors contributing to bridging social capital  on LinkedIn. An online social network is one that allows users to make  and share contacts by way of displaying their network (Boyd &  Ellison, 2007). The intention of a network such as LinkedIn, is to  create professional opportunities for its participants. Here, social  capital is seen as the resource embedded within the social network, and  as such is conceptualized as the benefit associated with online social  network participation. Bridging social capital typically exists between  weakly tied colleagues, It has been said to a superior type of social  capital for 'getting ahead' (Putnam, 2000). Understanding how to create  opportunities to increase bridging social capital in an online  environment is useful to potentially overcoming barriers that exist  offline. Using the partial least squares approach to structural equation  modeling, the thesis analyzes data collected from an online survey  (n:167) of LinkedIn members. Driven by theory, three constructs are  conceptualized as contributing to the variance in bridging social  capital. Ease of sue, browsing behaviours, and bonding social capital  all have a positive relationship with bridging social capital, and  together explain 53.8% of this variance. These findings are then  extended to explore the broader design implications they have an online  social network.
