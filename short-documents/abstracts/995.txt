    Lightweight magnesium alloys are being increasingly used in automotive and other transportation industries to achieve energy efficiency. The objective of this thesis was to study the mechanical properties of two wrought alloys AZ31 and AM30. With increasing strain rate the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength increased and the strain hardening exponent decreased for AM30 and increased for AZ31. Both alloys exhibited stable cyclic characteristics at lower strain amplitudes and cyclic hardening characteristics at higher strain amplitudes. The Bauschinger effect was pronounced at higher strain amplitudes, resulting in asymmetric hysteresis loops in both alloys. The influence of strain ratio (Rs), strain rate, and initial straining direction on the cyclic deformation characteristics and fatigue life was evaluated. At low Rs, both alloys exhibited strong cyclic hardening, which decreased as Rs increased. Fatigue crack initiation was observed to occur from the specimen surface and crack propagation was basically characterized by striation-like features.
