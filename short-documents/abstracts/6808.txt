The Bechdel Test is effective at raising awareness about biased gender portrayals in
media, yet it has been criticized for being an inaccurate assessment of gender balance in
film. Employing gender theory and political economy, this research interrogates the
feasibility of creating a reliable assessment of gender in film, and explores multiple uses
for such an assessment. It involves interviews with film professionals on the impact that a
reliable gender assessment could have on their work and the industry, and an examination
of representation research models focused on gender. The research proposes and tests an
assessment of misogyny in film. It makes a preliminary contribution to the creation of a
simple assessment for misogyny in mainstream movies as one step to challenge
stereotyped representations of gender in media. It contributes to communications
literature on industry and policy responses to biased portrayals in film.
