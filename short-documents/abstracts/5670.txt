Despite the small amount of Canadian literature on the topic of “mail order brides”, authors have argued that women in this situation often face abuse at a heightened rate, which highlights the need for more research. Focusing on the time periods of 2000-2004 and 2010- 2014, Canadian newsprint stories were gathered in order to compare media portrayals of “mail order brides” surrounding two important policy changes. Findings indicate that surrounding a policy amendment in 2002, more positive portrayals of “mail order brides” can be noted, whereas more emphasis on fraudulent cases of “mail order brides” are present in press surrounding a second policy change in 2012. As well, blaming the individual is constant over both time periods, with minimal focus on broader structural issues that disadvantage “mail order brides”. Future research is needed to expand understanding on this topic with the goal of promoting more progressive immigration policies.
