This thesis investigates issues related to the detection of arsenic from water sources and the analysis performed to quantify its presence. Through the literature it is shown that colourimetric means of analysis are essential, but current techniques suffer quantitatively, generally relying on a techniciansâ€™ ability to visually discern colour. An increased level of control, over the Gutzeit method, would serve to drastically improve the existing means of analysis. With reliance being placed on simple field portable technologies, considerable room has been left for misclassifications. Methodology and means of using these commercial products must therefore be tuned, if they are to be globally accepted as a means of quantification.

This thesis compared both benchmark and colourimetric technologies, to redefine in-field analysis. Here the goals were to improve both the classification of arsenic concentrations in water and alleviate the need for technical proficiency. A framework was built under ideal conditions, moving away from the qualitative state of existing colourimetric analyses. A combination of cameras and imaging apparati were put to use, in the acquisition of colourimetric indicator images. MATLAB algorithms were applied to quantitatively discern samples with assembled calibration curves.
