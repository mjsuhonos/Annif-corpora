High Level Synthesis (HLS) has definitely bridged the pathway between the Electronic System Level (ESL) and its respective structural block at the Register Transfer Level (RTL). However, the most critical task during HLS is to assess and find a superior architecture from the design space that meets the design objectives. This thesis introduces a novel mechanism for efficient Design Space Exploration (DSE) based on Priority Facgtor using the Fuzzy search technique to achieve the optimum result. This novel approach is more efficient than traditional DSE approaches and is capable of drastically reducing the number of architectural variants to be assessed for architecture selection. The proposed method, when applied to a number of benchmarks, yielded improved results with remarkable speedup compared to the existing approach. The HLS design flow shown in this thesis uses the proposed approach for DSE with optimization of three parameters, hardware area, execution time and power consumption.
