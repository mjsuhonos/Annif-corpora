    This study seeks to understand the factors that influence the perceived mental health of Afghan, Colombian and Karen (Burmese) refugees post-migration to Canada. It also examines what the differences and commonalities are among and between these groups with regards to the factors that influence their perceived mental health. Moreover, it explores whether these groups perceived that, as a result of their exposure to pre-migration trauma that they are at a high risk for developing mental health problems when they experience post-migration stressors. This study found that contextual factors, discrimination, and lack of resources and support affect refugee groupsâ€™ perceived mental health post-migration to Canada. Another finding was that only the Karen (Burmese) participants (some) reported that, a result of their exposure to pre-migration trauma that post-migration stressors affect them greatly. The information found in this study could potentially be used to inform policies and programs that protect refugee health.
