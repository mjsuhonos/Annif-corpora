CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Small Palindromic Repeats) and Cas (CRISPR
associated) proteins comprise an adaptive immune system in prokaryotes

CRISPR Cas systems digest invading nucleic acids and incorporate a 30 bp snippet
(“spacer") of the invader into the host genome

Spacers are transcribed into CRISPR RNAs (crRNA's) that recognize the same nucleic acid
in the event of a repeat invasion and guide nucleases to the target for elimination

We hypothesize that a plasmid vector, when transformed into a host cell, could
exogenously express a CRISPR/Cas system and prevent the host’s participation in
conjugative processes
