The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the intersection between transportation and human rights and how this intersection has impacted the disabled community. First, the consequences of a lack of accessibility are examined. The sub-categories of social well-being, physical barriers, financial earnings and ability to obtain employment, and health are focused on. Second, Canadian and Ontario legislation and case law are reviewed to see how they respond to some of these consequences. These include the Canada Transportation Act, The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, The Canada Human Rights Code, The Ontario Human Rights Code, and Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. After establishing that not enough has been done to reach as adequate resolution, solutions outside of legislation are explored. These solutions focus on universal design, citizen science, and autonomous vehicles.
