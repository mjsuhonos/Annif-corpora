The objective of this research is to conduct an optimized design of drilled shaft foundation for noise barrier walls. A non-linear three-dimensional (3D) finite element method (FEM) program, Plaxis 3D, is used to investigate the behaviour of laterally loaded shafts. Two published cases are used to calibrate the modelling method and validate the numerical results. In the case of a field test performed by Helmers (1997), FEM results agree very well with field tests in terms of ultimate load and deflection curves. In the laboratory test conducted by Uncuoglu & Laman (2011) case, numerical results agree well with their results except the soil-shaft interface modelling part. The Plaxis 3D embedded pile model tends to overestimate the lateral load capacity of a smooth pile. Though it is satisfactory in modelling a pile with a “rough” surface. Two theoretical formulas in estimating lateral capacity of piles are also compared with the FEM results. It is found that Broms’s (1964b) theory for cohesionless soils has underestimated the lateral load capacities and Brinch-Hansen’s (1961) theory provides a more accurate estimation. In summary, 3-D FEM is able to accurately simulate the behaviour of laterally loaded drilled shafts in soil.
