    The use of complex interchanges in modern highway urban systems have increased recently in addition to the desire to conform to existing terrain; both have led to increase the demand for horizontally curved bridges. One type of curved bridges consists of composite concrete deck over steel I-girders which has been the preferred choice due to its simplicity in fabrication, transportation and erection. Although horizontally curved steel bridges constitute roughly one-third of all steel bridges being erected today, their structural behavior still not well understood. Due to its geometry, simple presence of curvature in curved bridges produces non uniform torsion and consequently, lateral bending moment (warping or bi-moment) in the girder flanges. The presence of the lateral bending moments would significantly complicate the analysis and the design of the structure. Hence, a parametric study is required to scrutinize a simplified method in designing horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges. A parametric study is conducted, using the finite-element analysis software "SAP2000", to examine the key parameters that may influence the load distribution on the curved composite steel girders. Based on the data generated from the parametric study, sets of empirical equations are developed for the moment and shear distribution factors for straight and curved steel I-girder bridges when subjected to the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (HCHBDC) truck loading.
