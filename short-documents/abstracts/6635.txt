The goal of this research is to improve zone-based local active noise control for an aircraft passenger seat using head tracking and virtual sensing methods. Broadband diffuse sound fields are analyzed in order to determine the level of attenuation around the passengerâ€™s ears. The virtual sensing methods which were evaluated from literature include the virtual microphone technique, the forward difference prediction technique, and the adaptive LMS moving virtual microphone techniques. In addition to virtual sensing, a new methodology for integrating zone-based technologies with existing local ANC techniques has been developed. The virtual sensing simulation and head tracking measurements can be used to verify this methodology.
