    Nanotips are the key nanostructures for many applications. Until now, the nanotips of only the crystalline materials have been produced via various deposition methods which require sophisticated equipment, high vacuum, and clean room operations. This thesis proposes a single step, rapid synthesis method using femtosecond laser irradiation at megahertz frequency with background flow of nitrogen gas at ambient conditions. Amorphous nanotips are obtained without the use of catalyst. The nanotips grow from highly energetic plasma generated when target is irradiated with laser pulses. The vapor condensates, nanoparticles and droplets from the plasma get deposited back on to the hot target surface where they experience force imbalance due to which the stems for the nanotips growth are initiated. Once the stems are generated, the continuous deposition of vapor condensates [sic] provides building materials to the stems to complete the growth of nanotips. Further study found that the growth of the nanotips is influenced by laser parameters and gas conditions.
