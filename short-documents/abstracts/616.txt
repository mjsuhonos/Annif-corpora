    A 1.2 V, 8 bit, 100 MSample/Sec Pipeline Analog-to-Digital Converter is designed in 0.18-Î¼m standard CMOS technology. An emphasis was placed on observing the low voltage and low power design. The architecture of this ADC is 1 bit/stage pipelined configuration.
    With above specifications the designed ADC can be applicable for DVI flat-panel display; Giga bit Ethernet on copper, RGB to LCD converter and cable modem. This designed ADC can achieve SNDR 56dB in 100 MHz sampling frequency with 8 bit resolution. Total power dissipation is 40.6mW and INL is around 1 LSB and the maximum swing of the input is 1 Volt peak to peak which is almost rail-to-rail situation. The core area of the ADC excluding pads is around 0.25mm 2 .
