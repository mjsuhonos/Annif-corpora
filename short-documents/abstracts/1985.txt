    The objective of this study is to investigate the response of an Euler-Bernoulli beam under a force or mass traversing with constant velocity. Simply-supported and clamped-clamped boundary conditions are considered. The linear strain-displacement scenario is applied to both boundary conditions, while the von Kármán nonlinear scenario is applied only to the former boundary condition. The governing equation of motion is derived via the extended Hamilton's principle. Simulations are performed with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method via Matlab software. The equation of motion is first validated and then used to investigate the effects of the beam second moment of area, the magnitude of the traversing velocity, and centrifugal and gyroscopic forces.
