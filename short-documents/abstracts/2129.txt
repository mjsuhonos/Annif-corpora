    Construction activities have been identified as one of the major sources of pollution to receiving waters. Although Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) measures reduce the amount of sediment exported from construction sites, there are still significant concerns regarding the sufficiency of current control measures to protect receiving waters. This study documents the work completed to monitor and model the performance of a typical stormwater management facility used for erosion and sediment control in suburban construction site. The main objective of this study is to provide background information regarding the performance of stormwater management facilities for treating urban construction runoff prior to discharging to receiving water bodies. The RUNOFF and STORAGE TREATMENT blocks of EPA's stormwater management model (PCSWMM4.4) were used to simulate the quantity and quality of stormwater run-off from the area under construction and assess the performance of stormwater treatment facility (Ballymore Pond) located in Richmond Hill, Ontario. The performance of the construction site sediment control pond was found to be unsatisfactory due to the high outflow concentration of suspended solids. Some specific recommendations to improve its effectiveness have been made.
