Access to post-secondary education (PSE) for people with precarious legal status (PLS) is an
understudied topic, particularly in the Canadian context, resulting in a substantial gap in the
theoretical and practical understanding of the subject and a growing pool of wasted talent and
deferred dreams. This paper explores the possibility of expanding access to PSE for students
with PLS at Ryerson University, given the university’s unique commitment to equity, diversity
and inclusion and its intention to be a City Builder. I propose an initiative that would admit
academically qualified students into Ryerson, and put in place a tuition equity policy that would
honour students’ residency in the province, thus waiving international fees. This paper is
structured as a sort of “road-map” that could be utilized by other universities in Ontario
interested in undertaking similar initiatives.
