An Edible Campus can be broadly defined as the production of food on a post-secondary
institution’s campus. This research contributes to the creation of a Canadian Edible Campus
Database (ECD) that can be used as a network for future collaborations within the campus
sustainability community, thus creating opportunities for education, research and community
engagement. The database contains information about practices, size, and origin of Edible
Campuses across Canada. The database also creates a participant pool for a survey aimed at
understanding the diversity of Edible Campuses. Edible Campus team members were asked to
respond to questions regarding the goals, barriers and benefits for their food production
initiatives. It is the finding of this research that Edible Campuses often exceed beyond ‘greening
the school’ by demonstrating sustainability through the physical structure, teaching practice,
research, and relationships with people and nature.
