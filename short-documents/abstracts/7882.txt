We present a technique for finding roots of a quartic general polynomial equation of a single variable by using radicals. The solution of quartic polynomial equations requires knowledge of lower degree polynomial equations; therefore, we study solving polynomial equations of degree less than four as well. We present self-reciprocal polynomials as a specialization and additionally solve numerical example.
