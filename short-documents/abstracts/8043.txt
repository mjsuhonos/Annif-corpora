The issue of spousal abuse among immigrant women in Toronto and the silence surrounding it is important to address because it is a problem that is often trivialized. This qualitative study involves semi-structured interviews with 10 intergenerational Ghanaian women living in the Greater Toronto Area who have been affected by spousal abuse. The interviews focused on their experiences, coping strategies, and the resources that helped or could have been helpful in their healing process. The study results indicate that there is a connection between spousal abuse and the development of depression, which confirms the findings from previous literature on spousal abuse. In addition, the study results also reveal that the lack of accessible information abroad was a barrier towards seeking help. Recommendations that may help Ghanaian women living in the Greater Toronto Area seek and utilize formal support and counselling services are presented.
