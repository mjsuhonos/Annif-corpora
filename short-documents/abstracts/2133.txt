    This study extended research on the specificity of the effects of the carbon dioxide (CO₂) challenge by examining panic reactivity in participants with bulimia nervosa (BN) (n=15) compared to those without bulimia nervosa (n=31). All participants completed self-report measures assessing state and trait anxiety, depression, anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT), discomfort intolerance (DI), and eating disorder features. They subsequently breathed two vital capacity inhalations; room air and 35% CO₂-enriched air. Reactivity to room air was not different between groups. However, participants with BN displayed greater reactivity to CO₂ compared to the participants with BN. AS, DI, and DT could not be tested as potential mediators in the association between diagnostic group and reactivity because these constructs were not associated with reactivity. Eating disorder features and frequency of binges and purges were also not associated with reactivity. Detailed implications and suggestions for further research are discussed.
