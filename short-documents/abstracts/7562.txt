In this thesis, we present a cache placement scheme to deal with backhaul link constraint in Small Cell Network for 5G wireless network. We formulated the cache placement problem as a graph matching problem and presented an optimal file-helper matching algorithm. We defined stability criterion for the matching and found that our matching solution is stable in the sense that every helper finds at least one file to cache given that no file exceed minimum cache size.

We achieved a unique placement of a file within a cluster of helpers to increase the number of files cached within a cluster. Further, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm increases local and neighbor hit ratios as compared to a random placement, which in turn significantly decreases the traffic that goes over the backhaul bottleneck link.
