Using data gathered from children aged 9-12 from Toronto (n=628), a cluster analysis was performed seeking to identify children's lifestyle activity and transportation choices, and associated physical activity accumulation. This research sought to identify whether activity and transportation choices could be combined in the same analysis and produce a composite profile. It also sought to determine if specific choice profiles could be associated with children's health outcomes as measured by Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA). A two-step cluster analysis was performed which identified five distinct clusters, namely Screeners, Artists, Athletes, Scholars and Mobiles. Athletes, with a high amount of sports participation had the best physical health outcome while Screeners, with little active activity engagement, had the worst. Socio-economic analyses were performed on all resultant clusters, identifying statistically significant patterns in household income, built form and gender.
