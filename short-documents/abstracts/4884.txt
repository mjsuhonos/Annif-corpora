This paper will examine the transnational governance and its impact on the settlement process of Eritrean refugees. It will pose three questions: 1) What kind of challenges do Eritrean refugees face in the process of their resettlement? 2) How do the illegal activities of the Eritrean consulate disrupt their settlement process? 3) What difficulties do newcomers have in accessing law enforcement authorities? The paper will focus on the cases of Eritrean immigrants in Canada and investigate how the state of their country of origin continues to affect their day to day life in the country of reception and particularly how the home state regulates the flow of money and works to silence its critics. The paper further will investigate how the activities of Eritrean government can undermine Canadian sovereignty and leave refugees defenseless. Although the analysis is based on the experiences of Eritrea and its refugees in Canada, the paper will argue that such transnational governance can emasculate the autonomy of any country that hosts refugees or immigrants.
