The convergence of electric power grid with the IP-based communication network has posed many security threats to sustained power supply demands of our ever growing power system. A lot of work is required to find out innovative security solutions for smart grids which meet the stringent requirements of power network but at the same time provide security to the flow of information between the embedded IEDs in the power system. 
The project will first cover an in depth study of these standards/ guidelines and, security techniques. In the second part of the project, we will examine the implementation of these standards and guidelines on the station level devices like numerical relays, from renowned manufactures. A setup in the lab with a numerical relay and associated software tool will be made, to practically demonstrate the cyber security configurations in a real life situation in a substation.
