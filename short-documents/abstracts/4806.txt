Abstract: This is the first academic study to attempt to understand more about the men and women who make key decisions in television newsrooms across Canada. The authors surveyed all television news directors across the country. The research reveals that, unlike in the United States, the voting patterns of news directors mirror those of the general Canadian population. It reveals that news directors are more secular than those in the general population. The research also uncovered significant demographic differences between CBC and private sector news directors. Finally, it suggests that women and ethnic minorities are dramatically underrepresented in senior positions.
