    A photographic album is an intimate and unique object that traditionally has a significant and personal meaning to the maker. This thesis project presents an alternative method to displaying albums with the intention of preventing further wear and tear. By scanning the pages and creating a website or database that can be viewed by those who have Internet access, these cherished albums can be shared without the excessive handling that is characteristic to their nature. Custom-designed enclosures were constructed for each one as a physical housing for added protection. Six family photograph albums were scanned at the beginning of this project; a website has been created with the purpose of exhibiting each whole page in addition to the individual photographs.
