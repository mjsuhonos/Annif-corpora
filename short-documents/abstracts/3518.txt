This Major Research Paper explores the phenomenon of second generation African-Canadians young adults and their identity formation process. Through semi-guided interviews, 8 participants, 5 males and 3 females ages 18-30 of this demographic shared their experiences of identity formation in Toronto. The findings indicated that the participants have formed hybrid identities as a result of growing up between two cultures; they lived transnational lives which endowed them with the ability to have the best of both worlds; they have inter-generational conflicts with their parents, and their personal experiences have shaped their personal sense of identity. The literature in this study gives the reader an overview of the African Diaspora, the socio-economic challenges faced by African immigrants, the new acculturation process and the experiences of the second generation African-Canadians.
