Integrated substance use treatment programs for pregnant and parenting women provide comprehensive services designed to meet the complex needs of women and their children. Meta-analytic data associate participation in these programs with positive outcomes relating to maternal substance use and mental health, and child development. Given that programs are typically developed to meet locally determined needs and depend on available resources, considerable heterogeneity in treatment models and services exists. Further, little is known about process-related factors that support the integration of substance use and prenatal/parenting/child services within and between agencies. This study employed concept mapping methodology with a group of expert participants to examine their perceptions of factors and processes that support effective integrated service provision for this population. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to derive and define requisite factors and to examine their relative importance. Findings are discussed in relation to a preliminary conceptual framework for integrated service provision.
