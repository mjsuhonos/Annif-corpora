Road congestion, urban intensification, environmental degradation and health concerns among other factors have led to an increase in cycling rates in Toronto.  This increase in the cycling modal share, and a public policy environment that wishes to facilitate additional cycling, has in turn caused an increase in demand for associated facilities including secure bicycle parking.  This paper examines the current provision of secure bicycle parking in downtown Toronto office towers and formulates a best practices standard to inform and encourage a more widespread adoption for a diverse range of office building size, location, and construction date.  Many office buildings in downtown Toronto were built prior to the creation of zoning for bicycle parking, thus this paper focuses its recommendations on the implementation of future secure bicycle parking in the downtown core.
