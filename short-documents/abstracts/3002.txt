This study offers an encompassing analysis of labour market experiences of Muslim immigrants in the GTA.  A qualitative research  method was used to explore whether the events of September 11 has impacted the labour market integration of Muslim immigrants in Canada.  The findings are based on the responses of 6 first generation Muslim immigrants who were interviewed for this study.  At first the participants reported that their identity as a Muslim did not play a significant role in the labour market, however, their stories suggest some level of racial discrimination as a result of their religious affiliation.  The findings suggest intersectionality among Credential recognition, Canadian experience and racism that work together to veil racist activities that Muslim individuals encounter.  This study highlights the state and accreditation institutions as key players that keep the immigrant out of the highly desired occupation to reserve these occupations for Canadian born and educated workers.
