    This study investigates issues and challenges facing the inner suburban neighbourhood of arkham and Lawrence in Scarborough – Toronto’s east end. Like many other mature suburbs throughout North America, Markham-Lawrence has begun to see decline and deterioration that has resulted in lower quality of life and the flight of the middle class. Recognizing the importance of healthy, well-balanced communities for Toronto’s future, this case study aims to better understand challenges in the Markham-Lawrence area and proposes a series of recommendations for community improvement that are capable of expanding the life chances of impoverished residents, re-establishing a strong middle class, and spurring greater economic development.
