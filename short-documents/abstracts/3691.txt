This thesis will discuss the development of a radial actuator incorporated into a deburring tool. Gas turbine engine deburring is complex; this requires the tooltip to maintain active compliance in three degrees of freedom. This can be achieved through the use of a rotating action plane so that only radial and axial actuation is required. A proposed enhanced radial actuator has been made that utilizes the action plane model and fulfill the requirements for precision deburring of gas turbine engine components. The enhanced radial actuator was designed using four silicone rubber pneumatic diaphragms. The diaphragms were modelled using a finite element method and applying an Arruda-Boyce material model to the mesh. The stiffness behaviour was analyzed and compared to data from previous research completed on radial actuation within an action plane. The stiffness behaviour was determined to be superior and significantly improved as it could be reliably predicted.
