Anatomy of a Dress utilises object-based research to explore exhibition design and display. The goal of this project is to challenge the static nature of garment display in a museum or a gallery setting. This investigation materialises in the form of a small exhibition pavilion, using a 1950s ballgown by Julian Rose from the Ryerson Fashion Research Collection as its primary subject matter. The dress was analysed through a series of explorations, including technical drawings, x-rays, and 3D fabrication, all of which informed the design of the exhibition.
