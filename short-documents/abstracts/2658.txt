This study seeks to explore the factors that have encouraged people to start cycling more frequently, despite lack of improvements of cycling facilities in Toronto. This study uses a Grounded Theory methodology, and a mixed method approach. A literature review was performed to identify the initial sample, and additional literature was used to make a theoretical sub-sample later in the study. Primary data was collected through a survey, focus group and a follow-up questionnaire. The data was analyzed using open and theoretical coding techniques, memo-writing, and critical case analysis. During the process of answering the research questions, a conceptual model was developed to aid in the visualization of the theoretical complexity involved in mode-choice. These results were discussed in a broader context, including implications for the future of cycling-as-transportation in Toronto, as well as possibilities for future research.
