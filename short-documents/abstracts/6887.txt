The intelligent building is supposed to provide the environment and means for an optimal
utilization of the building, according to its designation. This extended function of a building can
be achieved only by means of an extensive use of building service systems, such as HVAC,
electric power, communication, safety and security, transportation, sanitation, etc. Building
intelligence is not related to the sophistication of service systems in a building, but rather to the
integration among the various service systems, and between the systems and the building
structure. Systems' integration can be accomplished through teamwork planning of the building,
starting at the initial design stages of the building. This paper examines some existing buildings
claimed to be “intelligent”, according to their level of systems' integration. Intelligent buildings
respond to the needs of occupants and society, promoting the well-being of those living and
working in them and providing value through increasing staff productivity and reducing
operational costs. Intelligent Buildings considers cultural changes affecting the way people live
and work, the importance of an integrated approach to design and management and the benefits
technological developments can bring in developing sustainable buildings that meet users' needs.
