This paper was among the first to critically examine literature on factors that impede Southeast Asian immigrant women's access and utilization of cervical cancer screening services. 46 articles examining Southeast Asian women and their utilization of Pap testing were analyzed using the core concepts of the Health Belief Model. Individual perceptions, (i.e. Asian cultural beliefs and traditions), and cues to action (i.e. physician recommendations) were most influencing on Southeast Asian immigrant women's participation of cervical cancer screening services. Proposed recommendations from reviewed literature were examined, addressing solutions that can potentially minimize these factors. Providing Asian immigrant women with culturally and linguistically appropriate education materials, and increased physician education were the most frequent recommendations proposed in the literature. More field research is needed in this area, including the development of culturally-sensitive interventions and strategies for enhancing Southeast Asian women's participation in cervical cancer screening.
