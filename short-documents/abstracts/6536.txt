Vaccine  misinformation  on  social  media  poses  significant drawbacks to the efforts of vaccine coverage rates. This research studies  the  interlinkages  between  pro-  and  anti-vaccine YouTube videos to help public health professionals explore new ways  to  reach  anti-vaccine  and  vaccine-hesitant  audiences.  Using YouTube’s API, we retrieved 9,489 recommended videos from  250  seeds  using  keywords  such  as  “vaccines”  and  its  derivatives. We then manually identified 1,984 videos directly related  to  vaccination  and  then  categorized  their  vaccine 
sentiment into pro-, anti-, and neutral. Results show that 65.02% of  the  videos  were  anti-vaccine,  and  only  20.87%  were  pro-vaccine,  14.11%  were  neutral.  Anti-vaccine  videos  were significantly  more  prevalent  in  the  “News  &  Politics”  and “People & Blogs” video categories; while pro-vaccine videos were  more  prevalent  in  the  “Education”  and  “Science  & Technology” categories. Results also showed that anti-vaccine sentiment  videos  have  higher  values  of  closeness  centrality (p<0.05), suggesting that watching an anti-vaccine video will likely  lead  to  more  anti-vaccine  video  recommendations.  Moreover, videos that had more dislikes than likes (dislike/like 
ratio) are positively related to pro-vaccine videos (OR=3.912),  suggesting  that  pro-vaccine  videos  are  more  ill-received  on YouTube  than  anti-vaccine  videos.  This  study  is  the  first  to examine the network of vaccine-related videos on YouTube and their centralities. The results highlight some possible limitations of YouTube-based vaccination awareness campaigns and also emphasize  the  need  to  diversify  how  YouTube  makes  its 
recommendations to help viewers break out of the anti-vaccine “bubble.”
