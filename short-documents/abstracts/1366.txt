    An analytical model is developed to predict the residual flexural capacity of corroded RC members. This was established by first developing an analytical model to calculate the residual bond strength at steel-concrete interface. The bond model is then implemented within the framework of the moment resistance method, and a new strain compatibility analysis was developed: to account the analysis of a corroded reinforced concrete beam, to incorporate dependence of the bond response on the stress strain and damage state of the concrete and steel. Method for calculating flexural capacity of corroded RC beams is then proposed, which is based on flexural analysis of RC beams that considers the effect of bond degradation. The predicted results of these models correlated very well with results observed in various experimental studies. This indicates that those developed analytical models tend to estimate conservatively the residual bond strength and flexural capacity of corroded RC beams. .
