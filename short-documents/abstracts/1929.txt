    Charles C. Zoller (1856-1934) was prolific photographer and native of Rochester, New York.  His archive is held at George Eastman International Museum of  Photography and Film and consist of over 8,000 photographic objects, just under 4,000 of which are autochrome plates.  This thesis focuses on the approximately 317 Zoller autoochromes of Florida that make up a small fraction of the fonds
    This thesis furthermore considers the visual representatin of Florida in color in the early twentieth century and compares tropes in this imagery to Zoller's representation of the Sunshine State.  Traveling and photographing extensively in North America and Europe, Zoller produced both color images with Luni√®re Autochrome plates and black-and-white images with various photographic products.  Upon return to Upstate New york, Zoller gave lectures on a variety of topics, illustrating these lectures with projected autochromes and lantern slides.  Since there are few know autochromes of Florida, Zoller's series are some of the earliest examples of color photographs of the state.  While Zoller's images are often predictable representations of Florida, they nevertheless provide a window into how Florida was presented in the early part of the last century.  This thesis compares Zoller's autochromes to other popular images of Florida in that time.
