The small-scale vertical axis wind turbine is designed and modeled in this project, considering all aspects of wind turbine such as Blade design, stator design, rotor design and converter system design. Electric Power has become a prime necessity for any country for economic development. The conventional fuel sources for power generation are depleting fast. The favorable alternatives are renewable energy sources. Although more invention has to be carried out in the field of renewable energy sources, every little effort in this direction may provide a solution to reach most economical power generation point. Hence the same topic was selected for Masters Project.

The goal of this project is to design a small scale Vertical Axis Wind Turbine, which is capable of producing electrical power even with low wind velocity. It can be placed on road dividers, sidetracks of train or remote places i.e. villages, military camps, where it is not economical to transmit power from power plants. Implementation of such project would reduce the dependence of an industry or remote houses, on electricity board.
