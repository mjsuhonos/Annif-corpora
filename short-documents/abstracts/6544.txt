Cities and their residents are becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change and its impacts. Cities will continue to face social, political and economic impacts which particularly affect the most vulnerable populations. Municipal governments have focused upon resistance and control when dealing with complex problems such as natural disasters and their impacts. This research focuses on the 100 Resilient cities Model to assess its robustness as a decision-making framework in relation to resilience and adaptive governance.

Methods: This researches relies upon 100 Resilient Cities as a case study. This project utilizes qualitative analysis of the 100 Resilient Cities model and critical assess its robustness through review of ecological and social-ecological resilience literature.

Conclusions: This paper concludes that the 100 Resilient Cities model is well-grounded in ecological and social-ecological systems literature. There is potential for the 100 Resilient Cities model to provide urban planners and policymakers with an effective decision-making tool in order to solve complex problems which exist within municipal governance structures.
