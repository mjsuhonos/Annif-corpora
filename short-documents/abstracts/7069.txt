Friend of the Courthouse is a website application where parties receive accessible and individualized information relating to their pending caseâ€™s procedure. The objective is to allow parties to understand their procedural steps. The platform promotes access to justice in utilizing digital media. It does so by encouraging an understanding of
procedural law. Although its application is best suited to the Quebec legal landscape, it can equally be applied in Ontario provided that a modernization of its court record system takes place. Considering that Friend of the Courthouse exemplifies the use of digital media as a vehicle for the advancement of access to justice, Ontario can in fact be incentivized to undergo such a modernization given the current access to justice issues it faces.
