This thesis investigates the potential integration of leading Corporate Responsibility and
Sustainability (CR&S) goals across selected Commercial Real Estate (CRE) firms, key
anchor tenants, and construction companies within the Canadian market as they relate
to office building assets. Current literature provides limited observations and analysis on
CR&S within the CRE sector, particularly for the Canadian market. In order to address
this gap and advance the principles of CR&S across the Canadian CRE sector, the
research provides a comprehensive qualitative content analysis of publically available
CR&S reports, along with interviews conducted with subject matter experts in the sector.
Reduction of energy, water and waste consumption, along with associated GHG
emissions have been identified as leading elements driving environmental resource
management, which in turn is identified as the founding base for integrating CR&S goals
across the Canadian CRE market. In addition to uncovering leading CR&S goals, the
study identified market differentiators and regulatory compliance as key CR&S
motivators, along with leading tracking and implementation measures for CR&S goals,
and their associated internal and external barriers to integrating CR&S goals. Ultimately,
the study provides an academic contribution in identifying environmental resource
management as a base for CR&S integration across the Canadian CRE sector.
