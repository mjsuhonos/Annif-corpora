Gone with the Madness is a photographic book project that offers a critical yet intimate experience of contemporary Iranian society as it has evolved in the years since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. In development for almost a decade, the project juxtaposes exterior urban landscapes of major Iranian cities with images of interior, private and social life in these cities, drawing the viewerâ€™s attention to the dualities and contradictions inherent in every aspect of life in Iran today.
