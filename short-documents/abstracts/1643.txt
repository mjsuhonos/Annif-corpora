    The Antarctic Ocean whaling photo album is an album published during the 1940's by a Japanese marine product company. The album contains 52 gelatin silver prints of a whaling expedition to the Antarctic Ocean and is a fascinating visual record of the Japanese whaling industry. Using this album as a case study, this thesis project is a study of the cataloguing process and preservation of a photographic album. The goal of this project is to make the album more accessible to researchers through translation, cataloguing and digitization, as well as to provide a preservation strategy through condition assessments. This paper summarizes the research conducted on the album, outlines the cataloguing process, the condition assessment of the album and provides a treatment proposal and a handling guideline for the album. The paper also includes a Romanization chart and a translation table of the album texts as aids for further research.
