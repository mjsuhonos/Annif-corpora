    This thesis presents a newly developed system for simulation and control of reconfigurable machines and applications in the polishing process. A software package is developed that consists of the Varying Topology Simulation and Control System (VT-Sim) as well as the Polishing CAM (P-CAM) software system.
    VT-Sim can simulate and control reconfigurable machines of serial or tree structures. It is developed based on mechatronic modules, each of which has a graphic user interface that can be connected to a physical module. The selected modules are linked through a graph-based topology design platform to generate an assembled system together with the equations for simulation and control.
    P-CAM can simulate and generate CNC codes for the polishing process. The roughness of the polished parts is simulated for selected polishing parameters. Once satisfied, polishing tool paths can be generated and visualized.
