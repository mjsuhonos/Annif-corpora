This thesis presents a preliminary analysis of the lip wing concept proposed by Dusan Stan of Aliptera Aircraft. A inviscid CFD-CAD actuator disk model was used to simulate a comparable geometry to that which was investigated experimental by Aliptera Aircraft. In general, a 10%-12% increase in thrust was produced at an optimal lip wing angle of 30o. This increase in thrust was consistent with the experimental results obtained by Aliptera Aircraft. These preliminary results are promising and encourage further research
