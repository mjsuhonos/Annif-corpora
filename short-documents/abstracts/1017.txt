This thesis is predicated on the objectives of Toronto's Official Plan: the cessation of outward suburban development, increased growth in the urban core, increased public amenity space to support this greater density, reduced presence of the car, and the support of public transit, walking and cycling. Recognition of the serious lack of available public domain within Toronto's core to provide the appropriate scale of public space required to support this new level of density, is the subject of this thesis proposal.
This thesis proposed a new large scale, north to south linear park for Toronto that integrates a system of bicycle, jogging, and pedestrian paths that connect it into existing mass transit systems, the urban core, and the existing east west park system, the Martin Goodman Trail. It creates this new public space by re-appropriating several vehicular lanes of Jarvis Street, and proposing the integration of new building development, park, sidewalk and street to amalgamate the space needed to accomplish this. Building and landscape, private and public space overlap and interconnect, to complete this new seamless urban park.
