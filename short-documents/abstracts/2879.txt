Intersectoral collaborations between planning and health partners have emerged as a solution to mitigating the problems of urban health. Understanding what makes these partnerships successful by evaluating precedents in the local context provides a useful resource for action. Adequately evaluating the successes of intersect oral evaluation requires work in developing an analytic framework for assessment. This study analyzes a case study around the partnership work evolving around the Region of Peel's built environment and health initiatives. Through the analysis of key informant interviews and documentation a logic model framework for the partnership is hypothesized and discussed in the context of its potential application within an evaluation program.
