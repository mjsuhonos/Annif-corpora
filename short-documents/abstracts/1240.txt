    This thesis presents the comparison of results for an 88-storey reinforced concrete building subjected to static and dynamic analyses. Similar to a building designed in a moderate seismic zone, the structure is designed and detailed according to the ACI 318M (2002) Code provisions and the seismic provisions of the UBC (1997). The building is modeled according to structural drawings and element design specifications are used in describing members' deformation characteristics. Resistance to dynamic motion is provided through boxed core-wall assemblies acting as cantilevers walls in one direction and linked with coupling beams at storey levels in the orthogonal direction. The equivalent static, dynamic modal spectrum, linear time-history and nonlinear time-history analyses are employed and a comparison of maximum inter-storey drift response is provided. The results of the analyses show that the linear time-history analysis is the most appropriate method in capturing the behavior of this particular building under dynamic loading.
