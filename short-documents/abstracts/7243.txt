The study contributes to the ongoing debate about the ‘privacy paradox’ in the context of using social  media.  The  presence  of  a  privacy  paradox  is often declared  if  there  is  no  relationship between users’ information privacy concerns and their online  self-disclosure.  However,  prior research has produced conflicting results. The novel contribution of this study is that we consider public and private self-disclosure separately.  The data came from a cross-national survey of 1,500 Canadians. For the purposes of the study, we only examined the subset of the 545 people who had at least one public account and one private account. Going beyond a single view of self-disclosure, we captured five dimensions of self-disclosure:  Amount, Depth, Polarity, Accuracy, and  Intent; and two aspects of privacy concerns : concerns about organizational and social threats.  To examine the collected data, we used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Our research does not support the presence of a privacy paradox as we found a relationship between privacy  concerns  from  organizational  and  social  threats  and  most  of  the  dimensions  of  self-disclosure (even if the relationship was weak). There was no difference between patterns of self-disclosure  on  private  versus  public  accounts.  Different  privacy  concerns  may  trigger  different privacy  protection  responses  and,  thus,  may  interact  with  self-disclosure  differently.  Concerns about organizational threats increase awareness and accuracy while reducing amount and depth, while concerns about social threats reduce accuracy and awareness while increasing amount and depth.
