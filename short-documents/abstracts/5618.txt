Posttraumatic social interactions are among the most robust predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following trauma, but social interactions have been widely defined and quantified in the literature. This study explored whether negative social interactions were more strongly associated with PTSD symptoms than positive interactions among adults recently exposed to a traumatic event, as well as factors that moderate these associations. Participants (N = 149) were assessed by the clinician-administered PTSD scale and completed self-reported measures of social interactions and disclosure style. Only negative social interactions, specifically general societal disapproval and disapproval from family and friends, emerged as significant predictors of PTSD severity in a multiple regression analysis. Sex, trauma type, and dysfunctional disclosure style did not moderate relationships between negative social interactions and PTSD severity. Findings imply that negative social interactions may be more integral to trauma recovery than positive ones. Clinical implications are discussed.
