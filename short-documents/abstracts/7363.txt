The term Social Economy has been used for years to describe a segment of the economy that is neither driven by the profit motives of private interests, nor owned by the state to serve public interests. Often referred to as the third sector, (distinct from the private for-profit sector and public sector) it defies clear boundaries (Moulaert & Ailenei, 2005). Thus definitions of the social economy vary. In the US the term social economy is not used at all; there the third sector refers strictly to organizations that adhere to the non-distribution-of-profits rule stipulated by the US Internal Revenue System (Graefe, 2006). In Quebec, the term Social Economy has been in use for several decades, but refers to a partnership between state and third sector organizations and an exercise in stemming the tide of neo-liberal globalization (Graefe, 2001). In Ontario and the rest of Canada, reference to a Social Economy is more recent and the concept is applied in a broader manner, in keeping with some European notions of the Social Economy (Fonatan & Shragge, 1997). This broader conceptualization eschews strict adherence to non-distribution stipulations and includes cooperatives and social enterprises in addition to nonprofit organizations.
