    Psychotherapy is an effective treatment for a variety of mental illnesses. Despite this evidence, the average Canadian does not have access to psychotherapy because Medicare does not generally cover the costs. However, Canadians attending post-secondary education can generally access psychotherapy at no direct cost.  Currently, there is limited Canadian research on the effectiveness of psychotherapy provided at university counselling centres (UCCs).  The present study examined the effectiveness of individual counselling provided at a Toronto university counselling centre and the preliminary results are presented.  Participants experienced a statistically significant decrease in mental health-related symptoms as measured by the Outcome Questionnaire 45.2 (OQ-45), overall current symptom severity, and severity of symptom interference in daily life from pre- to post-counselling.  Current medication, supplement, and vitamin use and family social support were not significant predictors of OQ-45 score changes.  Participants also gave general feedback indication that counselling was effective and beneficial.
