Qualitative interviews were conducted with three homeless participants who used social media and had access to the internet and a mobile device. The researcher analyzed the data by looking for themes within the participantâ€™s answers. Discussion focuses on the impact of social media, their experiences as a homeless youth and the interaction with social media on a daily basis.
