The Canadian temporary foreign worker program (TFWP) has grown exponentially in recent years and Canada now accepts more temporary residents than permanent residents on a yearly basis. Employers are increasingly becoming reliant on foreign labour to maintain their competitive advantage in a global market while failing to address exploitation issues. This study will examine modern notions of citizenship based on the principle of jus domicile, applying it to the TFWP in Canada. I argue that jus domicile can be used as a legal basis for long-term policies toward pathways to optional permanency. This study will present a forward looking approach to the Canadian TFWP by providing long-term policy recommendations, by taking into consideration current policies at the federal and provincial levels, and by examining ways in which the Canadian labour market can permanently incorporate TFWâ€™s.
