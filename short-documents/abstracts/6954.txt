Quantum computation has the potential to transform the way various Canadian industries
do business. Unlike classical computers which use bits, computers built using the principles
of quantum mechanics use qubits, which allows them to perform several complex tasks
simultaneously and at an exponentially faster speed. This research will analyze the potential
impact of quantum computing on Canada's cybersecurity and workforce. It will also
highlight barriers to entry for this burgeoning technology and provide recommendations that
address current and future challenges. It is proposed that if Canada embraces this
technology's opportunities and addresses its challenges, it can continue to be a global leader
in the field of quantum computing.
