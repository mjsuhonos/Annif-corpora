    This study investigates the feasibility of a sustainable winemaking eco-labelling program for Ontario. Currently the wine industry in Ontario encourages sustainability in their industry through a voluntary initiative. Research indicates the eco-labelling can be effective means of encouraging proactive environmental behaviour using market forces in some markets, by indicating to consumers those products that are environmentally superior. Through interviews with industry members and surveys with consumers this research determines the degree of interest in an eco-labelling program. Factors that could motivate or deter participation in the program by industry and use of the label by consumers were also identified. The findings reveal that there is interest among industry and consumers in an eco-labelling program. Furthermore, the eco-label should be certified by a credible agency, be simple in format, address the entire winemaking process and be accompanied by an educational promotional campaign.
