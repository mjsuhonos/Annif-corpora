    Young children who are infected and affected by HIV/AIDS are at risk for psychosocial difficulties due to the confounding variables associated with the diagnosis. Research is needed to understand what makes psychosocial intervention successful for children who are infected and affected. An ethnographic study of an intervention program in the Southern United States was conducted in an attempt to understand what makes this intervention successful from the perspective of the children, their caregivers, and their intervention providers. Interviews and observations with all three groups took place over a three week period. Results were analyzed from both an ecological and a child rights perspective, which suggest that combining social services with a childcare program, the implicit ecological perspective of staff and their knowledge of HIV-related variables, and the development of positive relationships are essential components of a successful program. Recommendations for effective practices are made, and future research needs are discussed.
