This thesis presents a system that visualizes 3D city data and supports gesture interactions
in a fully immersive Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). To facilitate more natural
interactions in this immersive virtual city, novel techniques are proposed for operations such
as object selection, object manipulation, navigation and menu control. These operations form
a basis of interactions for most Virtual Reality (VR) applications. The proposed techniques
are predominantly controlled using gestures. We also propose the use of pattern recognition
methods, specifically a Hidden Markov Model, to support real time dynamic gesture recognition
and demonstrate its use for menu control in VR applications. Qualitative and quantitative
user studies are conducted to evaluate the proposed techniques. The results of the user studies
demonstrate that the interaction techniques for object selection and manipulation are measurably
better than traditional techniques. The results also show that the proposed gesture based
navigation and menu control techniques are preferred by experienced users. These findings can
guide future user interface design in immersive environments.
