This work represents a culmination of experiences of individuals who have been subjected to adolescent psychiatrization and particularly, the influences of psychocentrism. This work builds upon the notion of psychocentrism as a social justice issue by exploring how itsâ€™ embeddedness within dominant mental health discourse functions to disregard the systemic, historical and cultural factors contributing to individual experiences of emotional distress. Through this analysis, the tensions of a white researcher with social justice aims is problematized and explored in tandem with the findings of this research.
