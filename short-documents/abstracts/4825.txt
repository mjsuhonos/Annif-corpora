The objective of this project is to present a literature review of hazardous waste transportation and the impact on the environment by studying Canada's regulations and legislations and examining the potential use of GIS in reducing hazardous waste transportation. [sic] It is hard to find a specific definition for Hazardous Waste since the hazard could be generated form [i.e. from] a wide variety of sources.  Therefore, the hazardous wastes defined according to the Transportation Dangerous Goods Act as those wastes that due to their nature and quantity are potentially hazardous to the human health and the environment.  Hazardous wastes usually contain explosive, volatile, toxic, radioactive and flammable materials, and that therefore, requires special techniques to handle the hazard to avoid creating environmental pollution or health hazards during packing, transportation, and disposal. [sic] The government of Canada and the environmental experts made tremendous efforts to reduce the potential hazardous resulted from handling, shipping, treatment and disposal for the hazardous waste and find out alternatives to control that hazard and avoid any environmental impact.

This paper also presented and discussed some studies that  point out the important role of GIS in minimizing the impact of potential hazard and reducing incidents regarding hazardous waste shipments through determination of the short and safety transportation routes. [sic]
