    This paper explores strategies of five Polish immigrant women in their search to enter the professional labour market in Canada. This study focuses on the most effective methods these women utilized in order for them to become successful. This study found that, despite their challenges and experiences, their way to success was strongly influenced by four main strategies they used to overcome these barriers. These are: use of Canadian government and other employment services/programs; networking within own ethnic community; improving their proficiency in English; and perseverance in the process of search for employment in Canada. This major research paper shows that there is much to learn from the strategies used by these Polish professional immigrant women for entering the professional labour market in Canada. The results will be presented in the form of research implications and practical applications for policy-makers, non-governmental organizations, and researchers.
