    Domestic violence is a serious problem affecting women in Canada. Immigrant women in particular may be more vulnerable to abuse and face more barriers in seeking help. This paper will examine the experiences of abused immigrant woman through a critical review of the literature. Domestic abuse does not operate in a vacuum; it is shaped and compounded by other interlinking forms of oppression. In particular, gendered immigration policies and reduced access to social services exacerbate experiences of violence. Responses to violence against immigrant women thus must be holistic and long term, challenging societal inequalities and underlying structures of power.
