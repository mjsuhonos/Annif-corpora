    The space vector PWM (SVPWM) schemes for high power current source drives normally produce low order harmonics due to low switching frequency. To provide a SVPWM with the best harmonic performance, different space vector sequences suitable for a current source rectifier (CSR) are investigated in this project. Details on how to achieve the waveform symmetries with minimum switching frequency for each sequence are discussed. A thorough comparison of the harmonic performance of different space vector sequences based on current source rectifier implementations is carried out. An optimum space vector modulation (SVM) method is proposed to achieve the best line current THD and reduced switching losses. The space vector sequence investigation has been verified in simulation and experimentally using a 10kVA GCT based CSR prototype.
