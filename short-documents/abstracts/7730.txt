The effectiveness of wildlife crossing structures in mitigating the impacts of roads on species and ecosystems have been well-documented in scientific literature. Despite this, there are challenges associated with translating ecological knowledge into policy and practice. The study examines the planning process for wildlife crossing infrastructure using a case study in the context of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and explored the potential of transdisciplinary collaboration and design thinking to enhance landscape connectivity. The study followed an iterative design research method incorporating knowledge from literature review, policy analysis and subject matter professional expertise derived through participant observation through work with the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. This supported the development of a conceptual framework for actionable research to encourage the co-creation of practical knowledge and specific planning solutions. In addition, the study contributes valuable insight to the broader literature of sustainable landscape planning, road ecology and transportation
planning.
