Media representations of marginalized people are a growing concern given the state of the current social climate. The origin of intolerance stems from a lack of exposure and knowledge and as a result, marginalized groups struggle to maintain adequate space and representation in mainstream media. This reflects a lack of inclusivity, diversity and safe spaces. Establishing inclusive digital environments that promote the equality of peoples rather than perpetuating stereotypes is a vital way to achieving visibility and growth among marginalized and underrepresented people. INFLUENCE Magazine is a digital publication that is committed to equality, representation and opportunity.                                                                                   
By providing a safe space for marginalized and underrepresented sectors of society to express every aspect of their identity, art and lived experiences, INFLUENCE Magazine fosters a positive environment for artists and individuals to freely express themselves.
