The feasibility of a novel total energy recovery ventilator (HERV) was studied, through the use of an Excel-based screening tool developed for cost analysis, and through TRNSYS simulations for performance analysis. Cost analysis indicated that the HERV almost always outperformed the conventional systems, whereas its attractiveness could be limited by its high capital investment. Simulation results indicated that the counter-flow HERV provided better control of house humidity towards the setpoint, in the meantime, minimized the annual energy use. The performance of heat recovery (HRV) and energy recovery (ERV) ventilators was investigated side-by-side at the Archetype Sustainable Twins-House located in Toronto, Canada. The ERV sensible efficiency ranged from 76.4% to78.5% at an outdoor temperature of -20째C and 5째C respectively, while the HRV efficiency ranged from 91.0% to 95.0% at -16.6째C and 0.7째C respectively. Freezing caused a dramatic drop in the efficiency that was found to be as low as 50%.
