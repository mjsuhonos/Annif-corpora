In this project, an analysis of the faster detection of shapes using Randomized Hough Transform (RHT) was investigated. Since reduced computational complexity and time efficiency are the major concerns for complex image analysis, the focus of the research was to investigate RHT for these specific tasks. Also, a detailed analysis of probability theory associated with RHT theory was investigated as well. Thus effectiveness of RHT was proven mathematically in this project. In this project, RHT technique combined with Generalized Hough Transform (GHT) using Newton's curve fitting technique was proposed for faster detection of shapes in the Hough Domain. Finally, the image under question was enhanced using Minimum Cross-Entropy Optimization to further enhance the image and then RGHT process was carried out. This helped the RGHT process to obtain the required time efficiency.
