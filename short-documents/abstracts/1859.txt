    This thesis discusses the Jacques Henri Lartigue album Paris Aviation 1910, which is held in the collection of photographs at George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film (GEH). It established Paris Aviation 1910 as the only remaining album Lartigue made prior to constructing his large albums and reconstructing them after his solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in 1963. This thesis also raises questions regarding the provenance of the album and the authorship of the images it contains.
