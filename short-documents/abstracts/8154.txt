The main purpose of this project is to modify a convolutional neural network for image classification, based on a deep-learning framework. A transfer learning technique is used by the MATLAB interface to Alex-Net to train and modify the parameters in the last two fully connected layers of Alex-Net with a new dataset to perform classifications of thousands of images.
First, the general common architecture of most neural networks and their benefits are presented. The mathematical models and the role of each part in the neural network are explained in detail. Second, different neural networks are studied in terms of architecture, application, and the working method to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each of neural network. The final part conducts a detailed study on one of the most powerful deep-learning networks in image classification – i.e. the convolutional neural network – and how it can be modified to suit different classification tasks by using transfer learning technique in MATLAB.
