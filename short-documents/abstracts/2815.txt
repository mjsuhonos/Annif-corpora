This thesis deals with automatic tuning of piezoelectric power harvesters. A prototype
was constructed to verify the effect of the application of an axial load on a cantilever
beam and the effectiveness of increasing the power harvested from a piezoelectric beam
via axial loading. It was shown, experimentally, that the natural frequency of a
piezoelectric beam harvester can be changed over a range of 25Hz. From the
experimental results it was shown that the power can increase up to seven times when
tuned in comparison to unturned. Computer simulations were used to demonstrate a
closed loop tuning systemâ€™s ability to apply an axial load effectively onto a piezoelectric
cantilever beam in response to ambient vibrations. The closed loop tuning system is a
viable option for tuning and can lead to increased power when applying the axial load
suggested by the tuning system.
