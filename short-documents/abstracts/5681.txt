This thesis is an applied cataloguing project wherein 180 Super 8mm films by multidisciplinary artist Arleen Schloss were catalogued at Anthology Film Archives from January-June 2016. Schloss is known mainly for her performance work within the Downtown New York art scene in the late 1970s/1980s, and for founding A's, a performance and art venue available for artists to show and experiment with their work. The objective of this thesis project was to catalogue Schloss's Super 8mm film collection at Anthology, while also conducting research on her artistic practice during the period she was most actively making films. There are two chapters; the first explores Schloss's background as an artist and gives context for the Downtown New York art scene and her place within it. The second chapter is a case study that details the cataloguing process of Schloss's Super 8mm films, and it also provides preservation recommendations for future use.
