    As global population and migration to cities continue to increase, urban poverty and shortages of affordable housing have become significant issues in Toronto, making it necessary to develop a model to mitigate these issues. This book focuses on incorporating urban agriculture with affordable housing, and proposes a building typology that combines the two. The idea is to provide accommodation along with space for low-income households to grow their own food. It is expected that by making these elemental needs accessible and affordable, the problem of food security will be offset, improvements will be made to the food system, and housing shortages will be alleviated within the city of Toronto.
