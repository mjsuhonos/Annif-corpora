    The main purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore the growing phenomenon of Punjabi immigrant women from the GTA entering the male dominated trucking industry. In particular, this study aimed to explore the factors that enabled immigrant women to enter a nontraditional occupation and to examine the role of social capital in impacting their labour market outcomes. By interviewing 8 Punjabi immigrant women who have experienced driving a truck, the results of the study showed that living in an extended family household and the support of spouses played a major role in facilitating entry into the truck industry. Furthermore, the accumulation of social capital within Punjabi ethnic enclave communities also enabled women to enter trucking. Drawing on existing literature and government publications concerning the trucking industry, this study also helps to illustrate how immigrant populations become significant actors within particular industries, in this case, the GTAâ€™s trucking industry.
