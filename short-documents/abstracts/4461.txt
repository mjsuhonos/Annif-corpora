This study explores the experiences of first and second generation immigrant youth within community youth programming in mainstream, multicultural and ethno-specific organizations. Through interviews with nine youth and three youth program staff this study reveals how youth view the community based programming they attend as well as how their experiences reflect social inclusion or exclusion. Young people's positive experiences are that youth programs are spaces that generate positive feelings, contribute to growth, assist in developing meaningful relationships and connect youth to their community. However, youth also disclose experiences which negatively impact their inclusion in youth programming. Using a lens of social inclusion, this study demonstrates the central role of community youth programming in creating socially inclusive or exclusive environments. These young people's recommendations for change provide solutions for making community youth programs more inclusive.
