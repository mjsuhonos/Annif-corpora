Path computation is always the core topic in networking.  The target of the path computation is to choose an appropriate path for the traffic flow.  With the emergence of Software-defined networking (SDN), path computation moves from the distributed network nodes to a centralized controller. In this thesis, we will present a load balancing algorithm in SDN framework for popular data center networks and a fault management approach for hybrid SDN networks. The proposed load balancing algorithm computes and selects appropriate paths based on characteristics of data center networks and congestion status.  In addition, a solution that supports proper operations of a hybrid SDN network will also be proposed.  The evaluation shows the proposed load balancing algorithm performs better than classic shortest path algorithms.  We also demonstrated that the proposed solution for hybrid SDN networks can support proper operations in complicated hybrid SDN networks.
