This thesis comprises a description and analysis of a personal scrapbook with 123 albumen prints compiled in the nineteenth century. Originally attributed to photographer John Thomson (1837–1921), it is held by George Eastman House, International Museum of Photography and Film. The goal of this thesis is to critically examine the original catalogue records and provide more appropriate and searchable catalogue information in the Eastman House’s collection management system.

Histories of photography in Asian countries featured in the scrapbook, and an account of Thomson's career contextualize the scrapbook. A detailed analysis of this scrapbook focuses on the attribution and subjects of the photographs and the compiler of the scrapbook. While the attributions for all the images can not be confirmed, this thesis provides more accurate and reliable information about this scrapbook and, therefore, paves the way for future research on this scrapbook and the history of the nineteenth-century Far East photography.
