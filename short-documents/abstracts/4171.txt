Today, there is a growing need for the implementation of sustainability in construction. Continuous construction and rehabilitation projects have begun to deplete virgin aggregate sources. The use of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) in concrete has been regarded as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative aggregate source. This thesis focuses on producing RCA of preserved quality through the use of a new protocol aimed at maintaining the original properties of returned-to-plant concrete. The performance of RCA with preserved quality and commercially available RCA when used in concrete was compared. Different concrete properties were evaluated including the fresh, hardened and durability characteristics. Results showed that the RCA with preserved quality performed better in many categories, including strength, drying shrinkage and salt scaling resistance compared to the commercial RCA. The use of 30% preserved-quality RCA as partial replacement of coarse aggregate produced concrete of comparable quality to that produced with virgin aggregate.
