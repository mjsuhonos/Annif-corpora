"This research is about the informal uses of small public spaces in the city: the laneways,
residual spaces and connective tissues of neighbourhoods. They are undergoing rapid
change and transition. By drawing attention to the unintentional by-products of periods of
growth and the residual adaptations of periods of decline, I will identify unique qualities and
characteristics of transformation, gentrification and ephemeral cultural practices of city centres
and downtown neighbourhoods over the last half century."--Introduction.
