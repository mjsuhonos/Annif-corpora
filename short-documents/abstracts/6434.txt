This research paper is a case study of OPGâ€™s siting process for a low and intermediate level radioactive waste facility. The chosen site is in Kincardine, Ontario, where nuclear waste is currently stored above ground. The Town of  Kincardine is in support of the project; however, several individuals and organizations are actively opposing the facility. The objective of this paper is to understand why the facility is facing so much opposition, what steps could have been taken to prevent it and how to proceed with the project plan. An inductive analysis of qualitative data was performed using explanation building and pattern matching. Lessons were drawn from cooperative siting guidelines specific to nuclear waste repositories in Ontario. The conclusion was drawn that omission of extensive public consultation in the siting process resulted in significant public opposition. Increasing community involvement when moving forward with the project may assist in reducing public opposition.
