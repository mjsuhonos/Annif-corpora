    This study investigated stress factors and child-rearing practicess in Somali-Canadian mothers of young children (between 6 to 12 years of age) diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. A grounded theory methodology was used for this study. Focus group discussions were held with 10 mothers residing in Toronto. Nine categories arose which were compiled into four themes 1) concerns and uncertainty over the child's development, 2) language and cultural barriers, 3) lack of resources and 4) financial burden. It was discovered that major stressors included lack of informal support, negative experiences from professionals, and financial challenges. The participants indicated that their major coping system was acceptance of their child's condition.
