In 2006, the introduction of the Places to Grow Act required municipalities to meet a 40% intensification target through infill development. This has transformed the development industry as many underutilized sites, such as Greyfields, are prime locations for mixed-use and densification. Although many developers have not harnessed the potential of Greyfield redevelopment as barriers exist, which has led to continued Greenfield development and urban sprawl. This paper, through a literature review, case study analysis, and key informant interviews, examines existing barriers to Greyfield redevelopment. Findings from the study were than applied to a Greyfield site that has immense opportunity for redevelopment. A preliminary site plan proposal and recommendations are presented to illustrate strategies that should be adopted to ensure successful redevelopment.
