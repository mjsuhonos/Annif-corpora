    The objective of this study was to characterize the flow and rheological behaviour of model wax-stabilized water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions consisting of light mineral oil, paraffin wax and glycerol monooleate as the oil phase and water as the dispersed aqueous phase. An[sic] laboratory-scale benchtop flowloop system was used to explore the flow behaviour of the emulsions' oil phase (oil, paraffin wax and surfactant). The key contribution from this work was that the higher initial temperature gradient (40°C compared to 19°C) experienced by the rapidly-cooled oil led to more initial deposition on the flowloop inner wall. The rheological properties of W/O emulsions with different water cuts (10-50wt%) were also studied. Rotational, oscillatory rheology and creep compliance and recovery were characterized on emulsions aged up to 28 days. Overall, the results demonstrated that emulsion composition, and age could significantly influence an emulsion's flow behaviour and rheological properties.
