The flawlessness of todayâ€™s standardized construction methods has created and reinforced a weakened and artificial understanding of materiality. By furthering our comprehension of natural materials, particularly wood,
designers are able to grasp the significance of the materials they employ, understand and manipulate in terms of its characteristics and boundaries. Wood as an organic living organism can be used to express a particular narrative, to tell a story of its existence and history within human use, as well as its individual identity, age, and testimony. This thesis attempts to address the potential digital fabrication methods that can be utilized to manipulate wood and its properties, which ultimately has profound implications on the tactile and sensory experiences of space. In order
to create a haptic presence, the elaborate surface, textures, and details of wood are crafted for the user, and invite all the senses by creating an atmosphere in the space.
