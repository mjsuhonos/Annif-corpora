    This study presents the concept, design, force and stress analysis of a connector, which helps in transmitting mechanical forces, power and data from one module to another in self-reconfigurable modular robotic systems. The connector is the most important part of self-reconfigurable modular robotic systems to connect and disconnect the modules. This part needs to fulfill a wide range of requirements. The two important properties, latching and geometrical shape have been focused on for designing the connector. The connector includes male and female components. The male component has a target ball; the female has a cup shaped socket, a locking ball, and an alignment cone with teeth for connecting with the male component. Two methods, quality function deployment (QFD) and Pugh decision matrix have been used for optimizing this design. In addition, for designing the connector of a self-reconfigurable modular serpentine sensing robot, one particular area of application and one special configuration of a self-reconfigurable modular robot have been taken into consideration. Based on the results of this project, a guideline for improving and optimizing the dimensions and for analyzing different forces and stresses for designing of the connector is provided to make a good model.
