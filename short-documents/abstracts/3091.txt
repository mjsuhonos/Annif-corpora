"The Broadcasting Act of 1991 lays out the Policy Objectives for the Canadian Broadcasting system. It defines it as a single system, owned and controlled by Canadians, comprising private, public and community elements, "which provides a public service essential to the maintenance and enhancement of national identity and cultural sovereignty"l Contrary to both the U.S. model where the broadcasting system was initially conceived as a purely private enterprise, and the European model where the broadcasters were government controlled entities; the Canadian system in its earliest stages evolved into a public-private system with both economic and cultural goals" -- Page 1.
