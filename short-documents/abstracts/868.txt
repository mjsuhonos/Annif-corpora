    With the recent occurance of mosquito-borne WEst Nile Virus (WNV) in Canada, the City of Toronto and the surrounding municipalities have undertaken the larviciding program to control mosquitoes during the summer months. The larviciding chemical, methoprene, can be incorporated in clay pellets or chalks which sink to the bottom of a catch basin sump. The main concern is whether or not the methorprene pellets or chalks will still be in a catch basin sump or to be flushed out during storm events. The objective of this thesis is to develop a water quality model, which is based on surface hydrology, mass balance and hydraulic characteristics of flushing at catch basin, in order to predict residual concentration of methoprene at catch basins and storm sewer outfalls. The findings of the research and all information from other contributing parties are expected to contribute to our understanding of the fate of methoprene at catch basins and storm sewer outfalls and improve the mosquito larviciding program in the Greater Toronto Area.
