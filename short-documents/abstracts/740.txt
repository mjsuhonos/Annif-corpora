    This thesis involves the use of simulation models to evaluate and optimize existing manufacturing assembly lines of electrical components. The goal of the simulation is primarily to mimic the existing production scenario in order to identify problematic areas such as bottleneck operations, conveyor speeds limiting production and factors inhibiting the performance of the resources. This simulation project uses a combination of the AweSim ®  software and logic programming using MS Visual Basic ® . Through coding, the logic of the flow of the parts is demonstrated in the course of the steps such as the intermittent conveyors with single and double part flow. There are line selection rules in the models that follow restrictions which will affect the makespan, mean flow time and the utilization of the resources. Using different scenarios conclusions and recommendations are made on modifications to the existing production in order to improve makespan and mean flow time.
