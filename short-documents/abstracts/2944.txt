The enthusiasm of immigrant sending countries around migration and development hinges on the fact that the flow of money, knowledge and universal ideas can have a positive effect on development in these countries. The Canadian Seasonal Agriculture Workers Program (CSAWP) was established in 1966, most of the Social Science literature on this program has emphasized its exploitative and problematic aspects. Without dismissing the significance of the focus and results of other research, this paper examines the social and economic development impact of this program on households and communities in Jamaica. Research done by academics and an analysis of Jamaicaâ€Ÿs newsprint media done for this research reveal that the CSAWP has had positive development impacts. Findings suggest that the program is delivering social and economic benefits to migrant workers and their families. It has increased income, consumption, child schooling and improved health care. In addition to improving the standard of living for migrant workers and their families, the CSAWP has additional benefits at the community and national levels.
