    Currently, parents of children with autism are dissatisfied with their experience of the assessment and diagnostic process. This study examined the experiences of parents and families surrounding the assessment and diagnosis of their child. It also explored ways of how parents would like to be involved in the assessment process. A feminist approach governs this investigation, and thematic analysis methodology is used to analyze participants' responses. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four mothers. The sample was drawn from three different oranizations serving children with autism. Six categories emerged and were compiled into three broad themes: (1) delays in obtaining a diagnosis, (2) involvement in the process, and (3) recommendations and support. The implications of this study suggest that parents would like to be more involved and more informed throughout the process of assessment and diagnosis.
