The usages of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been growing exponentially.  WSN are utilized for variety of applications such as monitoring environmental conditions of shipping containers or monitoring the utilization status of construction equipment. There have been many incremental enhancements with respect to energy efficiency and
latency improvement of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) protocols; however, localizing WSNs in indoor environments is poorly understood. In this thesis reports, the performance of existing protocol designs under the assumption that indoor positioning is required will be evaluated. More specifically, the metric considered for this study includes throughput, latency and energy efficiency. Afterwards, an energy efficient WSN protocol is presented called the Location and Sensing Network (LSN) that also has indoor positioning capabilities.
