There are various surveying techniques used in the field of cultural heritage documentation. Close Range Photogrammetry (CRP) and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) techniques have been widely used in 3D modeling applications. Various research studies integrate these techniques to enhance the quality of the data acquired. The main objective of this research is to assess the accuracy of TLS and CRP. The two methods are applied to two culture heritage case studies, which are located in the historic district in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The data obtained from both techniques is compared with data captured using traditional surveying techniques as reference data. The results show that TLS tends to be more accurate than CRP. In the first case study (Bab Makkah), CRP and TLS produced 0.044 m and 0.008 m overall RMS error, respectively; while CRP produced 0.025 m and TLS produced 0.021 m in the second case study (Bab Sharif).
