Heart failure is a progressive disorder. An estimated 400,000 Canadians are diagnosed annually with heart failure, and a quarter experience severe heart failure that is unresponsive to medical therapy. Autologous cell transplantation (ACT) has been proposed as a new approach for cardiac repair, and holds enormous potential for the regeneration of injured myocardium cells. Currently, ACT is under investigation in Canada. The use of ACT as a treatment alternative for heart failure patients has been established over the past 5 years across Europe and the United States. This paper will present a Canadian perception of the nursing practice, research, and theoretical implications associated with this new and innovative therapy.
