    An analytical model for predicitng the crack inititation life of low cycle fatique (LCF) of discontinuously reinforced metal matrix composites (DR-MMCs) has been proposed. The effects of the volume fraction Vf cyclic strain hardening exponent n' and cyclic strength coefficient K' on the LCF crack initiation life of DR-MMCs were analyzed. While both the lower level of the plastic strain amplitude and the lower Vf were found to increase the LCF crack initiation resistance, the effects of n' and K' were more complicated. By considering the enhanced dislocation density in the matrix and the load bearing effect of particles, a quantitative relationship between the LCF life of DR-MMCs and particle size was also derived. This model showed that a decreasing particle size results in a longer LCF life. The theoretical predictions based on the proposed models were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data reported in the literature.
