To provide data rates of the order of hundreds of Mbps and multimedia services, standardization efforts for next generation (4G) systems are focusing on target technologies and seamless connectivity through various types of networks, including wireline networks and WLANs. Different types of multiple access techniques, such as the ones based on multicarrier CDMA and OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) have been proposed. There is a need for functional integration of the multiple networks, and, with the evolution of IPv6 and QoS support for IP networks, an IP based interconnectivity is best suited. A QoS aware adaptive radio resource management technique based on multi-code multicarrier CDMA is discussed. We develop a novel radio access method and develop algorithms for allocating and controlling radio network resources so that system performance can be maximized and guaranteed QoS for multimedia services can be provided within the DiffServ environment.
