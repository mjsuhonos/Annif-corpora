This qualitative study employed an ethnographic approach to explore perspectives of children and adolescents on diabetes self-care. Their knowledge of diabetes and feelings about having the disease was also addressed. Rooted in the new sociological approach that acknowledges children’s right to participate in issues that concern them, forty eight paediatric patients between the ages of five and eighteen years participated in individual interviews. Participants were recruited from a diabetes outpatient clinic within the largest paediatric hospital in Canada. Data were coded using McCracken’s (1988) method of analysis. This paper presents a focused analysis of three major themes: self-care, knowledge and feelings. In-depth analyses of these integrated themes provided a rich understanding of how children and adolescents with diabetes come to accept their disease and how the process of self-care evolves over time. Despite the emotional challenges and complexity of managing diabetes, children and adolescents spoke of a resolve and readiness to obtain more knowledge about their disease. This paper describes the process of diabetes self-care from the perspectives of children and adolescents and offers suggestions for clinical practice and future research.
