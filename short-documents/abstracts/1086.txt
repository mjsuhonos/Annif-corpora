    Steel fiber reinforced self-consolidated concrete (SFRSCC) has the advantages of both selfconsolidated concrete and fiber reinforced concrete. Thirteen concrete mixtures (with short and long steel fiber) were prepared including control mix. The steel fiber volume fraction varied from 0 to 2.4% by the volume of concrete. The fresh properties of SCC were evaluated using slump flow test, J-ring test, V-funnel test and L-Box test. Bond strength, compressive strength and flexural tests were performed in order to investigate mechanical properties. Water sorptivity, water absorption and porosity, rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT), corrosion and freezethaw cycles tests were performed in order to investigate the durability properties. Bond strength gain of 244% with respect to control mix was observed. Moreover, the compressive strength and MOR gained 45% and 127%, respectively. There was no significant weight loss of the concrete specimen after freeze-thaw cycles for concrete mixture with steel fibers. However, flexural toughness was reduced after freeze-thaw cycles.
