Even though the relationship between teaching and research has been examined extensively over the past decade, and a number of published articles and seminar  based workshops exist (Hattie and Marsh, 1996) ; there continues to be a disconnect in the application and integration of these two concepts in the academic setting. This difficulty may be due to the perception that teaching and research are two separate entities that need to be fitted together
(Boyer 1990). An alternative approach to understanding these two concepts is to envision them as one entity consisting of two components that feed off of each other. That is, as academics, our goal is to engage in a single entity identified as scholarly activities. These activities should present themselves as an amalgamation of teaching 
and research. To have a scholarly presence, an academic must not only be competent in both areas, but must consistently demonstrate the relationship between their teaching and research throughout their tenure.  The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of strategies academics can consider as they continue to refine and develop their program of scholarship. A summary of the relationship between teaching and research will be provided, followed by a presentation of various methods that can enhance the teaching and research 
relationship both within and outside of the classroom environment.
