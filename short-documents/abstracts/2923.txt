The objective of this thesis is to design MEMS magnetic actuator for MEMS FTIRS. The actuator consists of moving part and fixed part. The moving part uses rotation-to-translation motion conversion mechanism to achieve large translation, which includes four trapezoidal plates, central ring, anchoring springs and connection springs. The fixed part of the actuator consists of four solenoids. The actuator can be integrated with separately fabricated micromirror plate to achieve high surface quality translation micromirror for FTIRS. The actuator is capable of eliminating titling by controlling the four solenoids individually. The MEMS magnetic actuator has been designed and simulated to be able to output a static displacement of 370micrometers. The stress has been analyzed for the moving part of the actuator. The actuator fixed part has been designed. Dynamic analysis has been conducted for the moving part of the actuator. The moving part of the actuator has been fabricated using MetalMUMPs.
