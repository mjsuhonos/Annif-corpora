With the emergence and expansion of the field of Photographic Preservation, it is important and beneficial to explain preservation initiatives on display to the audiences that we are engaging and preserving for. This assists in facilitating a public understanding of photographic preservation, as well as building relevance to the institution’s collections and mission. This project is concerned with the role interpretation plays in the visitor’s experience, specifically through text labels and seeks to gain insight into the ways museums educate their audiences about the special care required to exhibit photography. This data was collected by conducting a series of interviews with various institutions, as well as conversations with professionals in the field. Using these findings and appropriate research, four piece labels were created that would accompany and explain four differing preservation strategies in exhibitions: facsimile prints, timed light boxes, the use of drapery and low light levels.
