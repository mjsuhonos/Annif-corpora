Online shopping is becoming easier than ever with ecommerce sales steadily increasing year after year. Through recent technological advances, augmented reality has become widely available throughout consumer products such as the iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy S9. Using techniques such as object and image tracking, while using Appleâ€™s native software, ARKit, Sharp enhances online shopping by elevating the experience between consumers and the products they are assessing. Allowing users to have a heightened retail experience in the comfort of their own space, Sharp achieves a traditional retail environment through an innovative ecommerce process. With current solutions unable to mimic similar immersive online shopping experiences, Sharp plans to achieve new standards for ecommerce experiences.
