Poverty in Greater Toronto Area suburbs is growing at an alarming rate, particularly in the wake of the 2008 recession. One associated outcome is a dramatic increase in residentsâ€™ use of food banks. Suburban planning and design makes car ownership necessary to navigate these areas. How, then, do low-income residents address the barrier of transportation when accessing a food bank if they do not have a car? The investigation used qualitative research including a literature review, collection and analysis of data on food banks in the GTA, and interviews with food bank managers and front line workers. The results revealed that reduced access to a car, hours of operation of food banks, and the cultural difference between food bank users and donors in the suburbs are key areas for both long term and short term strategies that could ease the burden of transportation for food bank participants.
