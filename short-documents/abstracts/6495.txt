Policy/Program Memorandum Number 140 outlines the requirements for Ontario school boards to incorporate principles of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) into school programs for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). With increasing numbers of children being diagnosed with ASD, it is important to assess the facilitators and barriers in implementing this policy, and work towards effective academic and social inclusion. Through individual interviews and follow-up questionnaires, four behaviour therapists provided their perceptions and experiences of ABA in the classroom. A thematic analysis yielded five main themes: reinforcement in the classroom, consistency, ABA and behaviours in the classroom, collaboration, and attributions. These themes are interpreted using a social model of disability and a childrenâ€™s rights lens to answer the research question: what are the facilitators and barriers
to the effective implementation of ABA in schools? Limitations, recommendations for future research, and practical recommendations are discussed.

Key words: Applied behaviour analysis, PPM 140, autism spectrum disorder, inclusion, social model of disability
