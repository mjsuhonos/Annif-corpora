    The aim for this research is to identify the issues with poor thermostat designs in a window-wall condominium suite during cooling season, and to investigate how low-cost changes in the design can improve occupant comfort, reduce energy consumption, and increase terminal equipment service life. Temperature logging and fan coil operation monitoring procedures were carried out during the peak cooling season in a sample condominium suite located in Toronto, Ontario. Data was collected and analyzed presenting the effects of thermostat installation in proximity of an exterior window-wall and supply air diffuser, and system durability concerns of implementing a proportional-based algorithm via pulse width modulation. Several design changes have been proposed that can be implemented at negligible cost during construction design and are expected to lead to comfort and system improvements during the cooling season.
