    This thesis investigates temperature control of an aircraft engine bleed air system, aiming at reducing ram air usage to reduce fuel consumption while maintaining fast temperature control response. To achieve both of the objectives, a system configuration is designed to control both ram air and bypass flows. The analytical equations describing the systems dynamics are derived and utilized in developing the overall bleed air system model. Optimal state feedback control and output feedback control are applied in the temperature control system. Computer simulations and experiments have been conducted, and the proposed configuration and control strategy are shown to be effective in minimizing ram air usage and maintaining fast temperature control response in the meantime.
