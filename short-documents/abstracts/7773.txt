The current waste management processes only treat the waste to meet environmental regulations and neglects the potential benefits that can be obtained. There is a potential of viewing waste as feedstock for the production of value-added chemicals, which in turn reduces the quantities of waste. Anaerobic fermentation was carried out on TWAS under concentrations between 0 and 2.8 mg N/L FNA at a contact temperature of 25°C and pH of 5.5 ± 0.2 for contact time of 24 hours under Standard Retention Times of 1 day and 2 days. The FNA doses were; 0.35, 0.7, 1.4 and 2.8 mg N/L. A raw sample of TWAS without any pre- treatment, i.e. no FNA addition nor pH adjustment and a control sample (FNA = 0 mg N/L and the pH was adjusted to 5.5 and kept at a constant temperature of 25°C for 24hrs without any FNA additions) was also included.
