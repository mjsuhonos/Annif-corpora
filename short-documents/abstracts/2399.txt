    Active constrained-layer damping (ACLD) treatment is the combination of passive and active features in the control of structural vibrations.  A three-layer structure that consists of a functionally graded (FG) host beam, with a bonded viscoelastic layer and a constraining piezoelectric fiber-reinforce composite (PFRC) laminate is modeled and analyzed.  The assumptions for modeling the system are the application of Timoshenko beam theory for the host beam and PFRC laminate, and a higher-order beam theory for the viscoelastic layer.  The formulation is assumed to have field variables that are expressed as polynomials through the thickness of the structure and linear interpolation across the span.  The extended Hamilton's principle is utilized to determine the system equations of motion, which are then solved using the Newmark time-integration scheme.  Many support conditions such as fully- and partial-clamped cantilevered, partially clamped-clamped and simply-supported are analyzed.  The effects of ply angle orientaion, as well as FG properties, are also carefully examined.
