Usage of big data with before-after methods of analysis makes it possible to evaluate the effect of major transport investments on system performance. In employing before-after methods to investigate the impact of lane closures on congestion and travel reliability, changes and trade-offs in performance indicators are quantified and policy action effectiveness is evaluated. This is illustrated through a case study of two separate lane closure interventions on the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto, Ontario. Models using a regression framework were developed for the pre-, peri-, and post-closure test periods of the first intervention and pre- and peri-closure periods of the second intervention. Results suggest the impacts of policy actions on system performance are strong, and that congestion and travel reliability counterintuitively move in different directions. Reduced demand effects are observed, prompting discussion on how highways and congestion should be managed and whether or not municipalities should add capacity to regional assets.
