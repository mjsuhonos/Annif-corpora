    The practice of Architecture is in need of a new methodology towards Olympic sport infrastructure. The Olympic Games have shown that constructing Olympic buildings with traditional methods is unsustainable. Post-Olympic use is generally unplanned causing financial burdens for those cities maintaining the large buildings. This thesis/project makes reference to work of R. Buckminster Fuller, Cedric Price, and Archigram in developing a systematic approach to Olympic Architecture. The core concepts of systems theory and cybernetics are investigated and a relationship is made with architecture. This culminates in the design of a process that looks to successfully locate an Olympic gymnasium in a Toronto community. It tackles the question of how to build Olympic stadia with lower embodied energy and qualities of stewardship, adaptability, flexibility and modality while maintaining multi-functionality.
