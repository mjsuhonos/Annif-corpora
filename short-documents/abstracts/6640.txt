Membrane structures are are an unfrequently used architectural design element in the modern society due to their simplicity and elegance. However, these structures require often in their design process the usage of complicated numerical finite element softwares because of their non-linear behavior. Written calculations can only be used for the preliminary determination of the required pretensioning, but not for the whole design process, which includes several different loading cases. Therefore, this work with the title Membrane Structures - An Introduction and
Manual for the Design-Process of Membrane Structures intends to develop a possible way of determining stresses in a membrane structure caused by additional loadings.
