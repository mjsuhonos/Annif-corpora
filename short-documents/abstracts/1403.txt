    Using facilitators to assist nurses’ utilization of best-practice knowledge (BPKU) in long-term care settings is considered important in bridging the research-practice gap. However, the role has only just begun to be explored and understood. A theory that provides some insight into this role is Rogers’ Theory of Innovation-Diffusion. This qualitative secondary analysis examined the roles and strategies undertaken by 10 facilitators of BPKU, and compared them to change agent roles and success factors as conceptualized by Rogers. The single emergent facilitator role involves dissemination of best-practice knowledge (BPKD), and the 6 strategies include knowing the market, engaging the nursing staff, modifying the message, building a relationship, using influential nursing staff, and involving nurse leaders. The findings provide preliminary support for using Rogers’ theory as a framework for nursing professionals engaged in BPKD. Further research is needed to illuminate the connection and distinction between BPKD and facilitation of BPKU.
