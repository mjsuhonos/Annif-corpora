Design computing is concerned with general conditions deriving a specific result. This is done through an explicit design of process. This results in a shift from design process to process design. Process design describes design through series of algorithms together forming a notion of an objectile â€“ an incomplete general yet specific notation capable of generating a family of objects or object-states. In a practice that embraces process design, the creation of custom algorithmic tools (both virtual and actual) and the design of architectural objects, will be augmented with the design of architectural objectiles and object-states.
