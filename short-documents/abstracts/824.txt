    This thesis presents a fuzzy control method for a vibratory grain dryer. The proposed control methol maintains the resonant condition for a dynamical system having constant linear stiffness, variable mass and variable damping coefficient. The MATLAB simulation results have confirmed that the fuzzy control method based on amplitude measurement is reliable and efficient.
