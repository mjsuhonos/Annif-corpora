    The tiered wireless mesh network is usually divided into upper and lower tiers. The upper tier is equipped with wireless optical transceivers; the lower tier connects the routers that connect the users. Usersâ€™ connections can occur between each other or between nodes and outside the local area network in the lower tier. Whereas in the upper tier, the optical wireless communication is responsible for the higher level of data exchange. In this research, we apply a recent optimization technique for the design of wireless mesh access network in regards to the hop count and traffic demand requirements. This optimization is based on the plane sweeping and clustering algorithm (PSCA) to find the nodes and organize them in clusters based on location and distance. Then, we simulated the algorithm with Matlab software by generating a random network constellation and applied the algorithm to optimize the clustering of the network distribution. The simulations show the comparison between the number of clusters and their diameters.
