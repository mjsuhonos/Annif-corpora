Adults over the age of 65 years are now the fastest growing segment of the Canadian population. Although individual differences exist, aging is commonly associated with impairments in executive function. The present pilot study investigated the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on improving executive functioning in older adults, while additionally decreasing perceived stress and improving psychological wellbeing. It was hypothesized that compared with an active control group, the MBSR group would display significant improvements in executive functioning, mood, self-esteem, and perceived stress. Participants were randomly assigned to either MBSR (n=40) or an active control group (n=32). Results suggest that MBSR is associated with significantly enhanced quality of life compared with the control condition. No additional significant results were found. A full-scale study will be necessary to clarify the present results.
