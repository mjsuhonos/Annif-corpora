The vast majority of the world’s transportation options heavily rely on fossil fuel outputs, which
has been a major contributing factor in the acceleration of global climate change. Given
Ontario’s relatively ‘clean’ supply mix of electricity, recent public policy outputs reflect a
shifting interest in better utilizing electricity to reform the transportation sector to meet
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets. The minimal proportion of electric vehicle
ownership despite the province’s incentive programs suggests research into the barriers to
adoption in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area must be identified to inform future decision making.
A survey was completed amongst current electric vehicle owners as well as gasoline and
diesel-vehicle owners to understand attitudes towards the technology and sustainable
transportation reform more broadly. The results aim to better predict future tactics for a more
successful diffusion of alternative mobility options to acquire greater consumer and public
acceptance.
