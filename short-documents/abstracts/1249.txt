    This comprehensive literature review serves as an exploratory overview of previous research conducted on senior sexuality and the effect on immigrant seniorsâ€™ sexuality of settlement in Canada. Content analysis was used to systematically uncover similarities and differences among the various sources. The findings show that sexuality and aging are important emerging issues, that healthcare professionals and other care providers need to become more informed about this area and to take a more active role to converse with senior clients about healthy sexuality. Additionally, some cultures and religions, regardless of time of settlement, may be more conservative than Canadian born seniors, with the cautionary note that these cultural differences are not representative of members of immigrant senior populations generally.
