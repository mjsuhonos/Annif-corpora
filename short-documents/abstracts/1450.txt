    Design of a graphical user interface (GUI) is a delicate task requiring knowledge of human cognitive behaviour, design strategies and programming skills. In this thesis work, a GUI has been developed for control of a robotic arm that is capable of sample retrieval and collection. This thesis work creates a bridge between technical and psychological aspects of interface design by integrating the concepts of compatibility of GUI with users, consistency in design, visual hierarchy and page layout.
    The developed GUI is able to support control of the robotic manipulator autonomously and manual operation using a joystick. Combinations of control functions have been defined and implemented to alleviate the operatorâ€™s efforts. The developed GUI is capable of task planning in offline mode. Implemented intelligent server/client architecture enables efficient remote control of the robotic arm. The presented interface can also be used for multiple systems with minimal changes. To verify the effectiveness of the developed GUI, experiments have been conducted using a robotic arm comprised of three rotary joints and a scoop.
