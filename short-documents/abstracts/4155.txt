Twitter is one of the popular social media websites. It has more than 400 million active
users. They post a huge number of tweets daily to share their opinions and knowledge in
different languages and locations. Twitter has been used to distribute news, politics and
more. This thesis proposes an approach to recommend new followees to Twitter users
who just moved to a new place where the local language is different. A recommender
system is developed that provides Twitter users the ability to adjust and engage in a new
culture and helps them adapt to a new environment. This recommender system finds
usersâ€™ interests from his historical tweets in his mother language and looks for followees
who have the same interests in the local language. This proposed system uses Twitter
APIs to fetch local tweets after finding the location of the user and recommends similar
local followees to the system user.
