    The performance of aircraft gas turbine engines mainly depends on performance of the turbine which expands the combusted air into the atmosphere. The turbine is a critical part which gets affected by the hot gas from combustor exhaust. So in order to enhance the performance of gas turbine engines, a proposed cooling type called film cooling is used for more than six decades. The current work is also an attempt to enhance the performance of the gas turbine engine by enhancing the film cooling performance. The film cooling performance was numerically calculated on a flat plate with micro-hole and compared the cooling performance from the macro-hole. The analysis was carried out for different blowing ratios and found that the coolant from micro-hole performs better in the vicinity region and also spreads well in the lateral direction. The vortex structure is also captured from the proposed turbulence model and discussed. The behaviour of micro flow inside the coolant pipe was also analyzed. The comparison between multiple micro-hole jets and discrete jets was also made and discussed.
