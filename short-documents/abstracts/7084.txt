This paper examines the various methods by which digital media is integrated into museum spaces. With the Aga Khan Museum trying to improve the impact and educational outreach of, and engagement with, their permanent collection, digital media can serve as a way to bridge the current gap that exists between visitor knowledge and the information conveyed in the permanent collections gallery. By structuring narratives into the artifacts, a stronger empathetic understanding between visitor and the histories related to these objects is encouraged. Through theoretical research and past case studies, this paper will propose solutions on how digital media could be implemented at the Aga Khan Museum.
