    This paper is an examination of the Preservation of Photographs seminars held yearly since 1991 by the Image Permanence Institute at Rochester Institute of Technology and George Eastman House. The world of photography was affected by a variety of changes during this time, which were manifested in the subject matter covered at the Seminar. The purpose of this examination is to make a detailed review of this Seminar, see what changes have been made, and assess how and why these changes took place to better be aware of our priorities today. It was not the intent of this paper to be critical of past practices, but rather to attempt to chronicle and understand how these practices have evolved over time.
