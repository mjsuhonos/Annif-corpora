An Impeccable State is a multidisciplinary installation drawing on found and constructed archives; a meditation on the concept of social deviance within the context of an imperial, homogenizing globalism. Working in photography, video and sculpture, I embark on a wide trajectory of research and production concerning the nebulous histories of social deviance and control. From Theseus’ defeat of the Minotaur and civilization’s ‘triumph’ over ‘barbarism’; the leprosarium to the asylum; McCarthyism to modern-day deradicalization programs with their claim of a ‘cure’ for violent fundamentalism, An Impeccable State reflects on the attitudes, architectures and apparati manifested in response to the sometimes ‘undesirable’ plurality of the human condition.
The support paper that follows is organized into three chapters: a brief tracing of the historical trajectories that inform and propel the installation; a detailed methodology; and the contextualization of the work in relation to contemporary documentary and artistic practices.
