The growth of cities places urbanization as one of the 21st centuryâ€™s most significant global trends. As urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa increase so do food insecurities. One long-term strategy used by households to improve access to nutritional food is to practice urban agriculture. This raises the question of what the impact might be on cities if urban farmers were better supported through training. This issue is important for women who play a strong role in urban farming. The central goals of this study are to analyze and evaluate the impact of urban agriculture based training on individual women. This study was informed by primary and secondary data. The findings are the result of in-depth qualitative research in Nairobi, Kenya. The research reveals that the urban agriculture training is having a positive impact on female participants. Recommendations to further enhance the impact of training on the female participants are discussed.
