Stormwater ponds have been implemented in many municipalities to control urban runoff and
retain pollutants, such as nutrients and suspended solids. Two stormwater ponds in Toronto,
Ontario were evaluated for their ability to retain nutrients and suspended solids and were also
used to investigate mechanisms by which stormwater ponds remove nutrient pollutants,
including the importance of deposition and internal loading. Over the entire study period, Hydro
Pond East (HEP) retained 1415 mg of total suspended solids (TSS) and MAT retained 1127 mg
of TSS. Both Hydro East Pond (HEP) and Mattamy Rouge (MAT) were net exporters of
phosphorus (P) over the entire season, with 6.35 mol or 0.20 kg and 53.9 mol or 1.67 kg
exported, respectively. HEP had net retention of 2672 mol or 37.4 kg of nitrogen (N) but MAT
exported 264 mol or 3.7 kg of nitrogen over the entire study. This study has demonstrated that
stormwater ponds have the ability to provide retention of nutrients and TSS, but their function
may be enhanced as they may become exporters. However, the amount of nutrients exported was
extremely low and may have been driven by the anomalously dry 2016 year in Toronto. Further
research should be done on these same ponds to observe how they may perform under an
anomalously wet year (e.g. 2017). There is a need for a future model to synthesize the data from
literature on stormwater ponds to better understand their function to better help local water
managers determine if these ponds are needed and how they may need to enhance their function.
