Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity. The most common management tool, stimulant medication, shows limited efficacy in youth due to side effects, stigma, and noncompliance. The current quasi-experimental study examines the influence of a behavioural, mindfulness-based treatment program for youth, Integra Mindfulness Martial Arts, on theta power, beta power, and theta/ beta ratio (TBR), neural indices reflecting attentional ability. Additionally, the current study compared the use of rest versus active attention tasks in order to determine which task type best displayed attention-related treatment gains. Improvements in attentional ability, indexed by a decrease in TBR, were found for the treatment group, but not controls, during an active attention task and not during a rest task. These findings support mindfulness training as a treatment option for ADHD, and support the use of active versus passive attention tasks when examining treatment-related gains.
