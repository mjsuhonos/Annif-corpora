What role do school and church condominium conversions play in processes of
neighbourhood change? This paper examines 40 residential condominium conversions of
former neighbourhood institutions in Ontarioâ€™s three largest urban municipalities to
determine their role within local gentrification processes. The research analyzes indicator
data over time in each conversion neighbourhood to identify gentrification trends and the
points at which the conversions are proposed within or outside them. The research finds
that post-institutional conversions can fall at any point before, during, after or outside
neighbourhood gentrification. This paper concludes that such conversions do not play a
universal driving or reactive role, however they have the power to foster further
gentrification where they occur early in the process. Planners are thus encouraged to
consider facilitating alternatives to private conversion in particular neighbourhood
contexts. Further research is recommended on the intersection of heritage conservation,
adaptive reuse and neighbourhood gentrification.
