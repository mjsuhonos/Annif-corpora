This article presents 3-D aluminum micro-nanostructures for enhanced light absorption. Periodic microhole arrays
were created by firing a train of femtosecond laser pulses at megahertz pulse frequency onto the surface of an
aluminum target at ambient conditions. The laser trains ablated the target surface and created microholes leading
to the generation of deposited nanostructures inside and around the microholes. These micro-nanostructures
showed enhanced light absorption, which is attributed to surface plasmonics induced by the generation of both
nano- and microstructures. These micro-nanostructures may be promising for solar cell applications.
