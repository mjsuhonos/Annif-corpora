Despite the growing importance of accessibility planning and the legislated recognition of Human Rights in the planning profession, there is no universal, operational definition of accessibility planning. Moreover, the objectives of accessibility planning for municipalities and the private sector are largely ambiguous beyond the point of minimum Ontario Building Code standards. This MRP provides an annotated bibliography on the various subcategories that inform accessibility planning, which can act as a starting point for practitioners who are unfamiliar with the subject. The paper also analyzes the current understanding of accessibility in planning and related fields to provide an immediate understanding of accessibility, as well as note areas of similarity or conflict in varying sectors. The report concludes with a discussion of some potential areas for future research and development within the field.
