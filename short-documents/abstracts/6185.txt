There is a common belief in the queer community that the oppressed cannot oppress others. In many ways, this support paper will document the meandering paths I took to create the short documentary No Fats, No Femmes, No Asians. But more than that, it addresses how such blatant racism and discrimination is accepted in the queer community. It is a discussion of how queers and Asians are portrayed in the media, and how the early representation of these two groups has created trauma and has become ingrained in the larger queer community.                                           I will be borrowing from important questions raised by neocolonialists, critical race and queer theorists, as I make references to popular and queer culture. These will be my guides for a theoretical investigation of identity politics in Canada, specifically identities of queer Asian men. Using experimental, auto ethnographic, and performative documentary tactics, I will offer alternative images and different ways of presenting those images so that they cannot be taken up as another form of subjugating queer Asian men into stereotypical discourse.
