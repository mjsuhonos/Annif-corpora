    The combination of horizontal curves with vertical alignments is commonly used in different classifications of highways; either on highway mainstream or on highway interchange ramps. The horizontal curves, combined with vertical alignments, may be single, compound or reverse horizontal curves. The current design guidelines do not adequately investigate vehicle stability on such three-dimensional (3D) alignments. Computer software that simulates vehicle behaviour on different geometrical alignments was employed to investigate vehicle stability on such 3D alignments. It was found that vehicle safety is questionable, especially for larger vehicles on reverse curves associated with vertical alignments. The critical speed, where the vehicle starts to rollover or skid, was found to be close to design speed for those 3D alignments. Design aids were then developed to address the recommended solutions to maintain the margin of safety required.
