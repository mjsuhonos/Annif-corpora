    An automated machining process planning system for rotational parts is designed, developed and implemented. The system is called IPPS_R for Intelligent Process Planning System for Rotational parts. The IPPS_R system is designed for generating process plans for manufacturing rotational parts using metal cutting operations. A generative approach is employed to determine process operations and sequences automatically. For each machining feature, based on the accuracy and surface quality requirements, a fuzzy logic approach is developed to generate machining operations. A method of ranking the machining priorities of the features according to the feature relationship matrix is developed for sequencing operations. Moreover, the heuristic search of process plans is achieved by minimizing the number of setups in a plan. Finally, the IPPS_R system with a user-friendly interface is implemented in Microsoft Visual C++ on a personal computer, utilizing Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC). Two sample parts are used to demonstrate applications of the IPPS_R system.
