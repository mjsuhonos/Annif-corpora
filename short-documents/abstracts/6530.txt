The Government of Ontario has recently introduced legislation which would allow municipalities to implement inclusionary zoning, a policy tool which would require developers to include affordable housing units in new residential developments. This study examines the potential impacts that implementing an inclusionary zoning program would have on the decision making process of developers operating in the Toronto housing market. The author found that without sufficient incentives inclusionary zoning policies impact the financial returns new developments are able to generate. This paper concludes that in order for inclusionary zoning to be successfully implemented without causing financial hardship on developers, incentives such as density bonuses should be offered.
