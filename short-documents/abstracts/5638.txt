This thesis critiques contemporary architecture tracing its faults to favoritism of scientific thinking, diminishing urban culture and commodification of architecture. The effects  of these shortcomings have fostered a loss of captivation between humanity and architecture placing people at odds with their built surroundings.  This thesis aims to reintegrate captivation within design drawing metaphorical inspiration from storytelling to create engaging architectural spaces. In so doing, architectural storytelling is established as a new design theory with the aim of integrating rich narratives within the foundation of the architectural design process rekindling the strained relationship between architecture and mankind. Storytelling architecture will be show cased through the design of a subway station at Queen St. and Ossington Ave. in Toronto
