In 2004, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy was proposed to community service organizations, police and school boards in Toronto, Canada as a strategy for providing undocumented residents with access to basic services and protections. Under this proposal, service organizations would implement policies against collecting status information from clients and would agree to refrain from reporting undocumented clients to immigration enforcement. While there has been some positive reception to DADT in the city, numerous challenges have threatened its long term viability. This study examines the problems involved in implementing this policy and explores how this initiative may be effective in providing undocumented residents with access to basic services.
