Wind power generation is uncertain and intermittent accentuating variability.  Currently in  many power systems worldwide, the total generation-load unbalance caused by mismatch between forecast and actual wind power output is handled by automatic governor control and real-time 5-minute balancing markets, which are operated by the independent system operators for maintaining reliable operation of power systems.  Mechanisms such as automatic governor control and real-time 5-minute balancing markets are in place to correct the mismatch between the load forecast and the actual load.  They are not designed to address increased uncertainty and variability introduced by large-scale wind power or solar power generation expected in the future.  Thus, large-scale wind power generation with increased uncertainty and intermittency causing variability poses a techno-economic challenge of sourcing least cost load balancing services (reserve).
