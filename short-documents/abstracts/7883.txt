We study determining the posture of an in-parallel planar manipulator, which has three connectors composed of revolute, prismatic and revolute joints, from specified active joint variables. We construct an ideal in the field of complex numbers,
and we introduce self inversive polynomials. We provide results for an in-parallel planar manipulator, which has a base and moving platform in right triangular shape. Using Sage computer algebra system, we compute its Groebner bases. We illustrate that the single variable polynomials obtained from the Groebner bases are self reciprocal.
