As the adoption of wearable technology devices increases, so does the abandonment of these devices. Today, an increasing number of health-conscious consumers use wearable technology devices (WTDs) to self-track their health. Large tech companies are trying to close the gap between consumer wearables and their use in healthcare. This study provides an insight into consumer intentions to use wearable technology in healthcare. A quantitative study was conducted to examine factors that affect behavioural intent to use WTDs. The researcher surveyed 277 participants. The results from statistical analysis of the data gathered through survey methodology showed that the research modelâ€™s constructs of performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, habit, and personalization were positively associated with the behavioral intention to use WTDs, while price value, privacy concerns, and health consciousness were not. The research findings contribute to the body of literature about consumer health information technology acceptance. Practitioners will also be able to use the results to increase the use of WTDs among consumers in the context of healthcare. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future research are discussed.
