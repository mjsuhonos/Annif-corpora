During the last decade, Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) have become a part of modern transportation fleet, offering green alternatives to fossil fuel based transit system. Taking PHEVs great potentials into consideration, this transition can revolutionize transportation systems and push technological advancements further.

However, in spite of plentiful economical and environmental advantages, new concerns are being brought up as PHEVs’ utilization rate increases. PHEV’s driving force is supplied by electricity. Hence, the built-in battery requires charging. Such newly introduced power demand, has raised alarming realizations for utility providers. Impacts of PHEVs on distribution networks, although have been proven to be noticeable, have not been thoroughly investigated for future years.

In smart grid, the charging of PHEVs can be controlled to reduce the peak load, known as Demand-Side Management (DSM). In this work, we explore various DSM approaches accompanied by their effects on power consumption patterns. Moreover, Geometric Water-filling (GWF) method has been utilized to increase the accuracy of our proposed scheduling schemes. The main contribution of this work emerges by fusing consumer and utility provider concerns, resulting in our dual-target objective function. Such method allows us to alter the focal point between consumer and utility company satisfaction.
