    A numerical study into magneto-aerodynamic bleed control systems has been undertaken with the intent of improving the shock swallowing ability of high speed engine intakes. Past research has shown that bleed slots effectively remove sufficient mass flow of air from the system to permit shocks to be swallowed. A magnetic field's influence on a charged boundary layer creates a possibility of sealing a bleed slot when not needed. 2D bleed slots were modeled using structured grids for use with the FLUENT CFD solver. User defined functions were written to simulate charge generation and magnetic field forces. Solutions revealed that bleed slot angles, free stream Mach numbers, pressure ratios, boundary layer displacement thickness, field strength and field position all affect how the system performs. Results have shown that a properly positioned magnetic field can reduce sonic flow coefficients up to 88%, thus justifying further research and investment in wind tunnel experiments.
