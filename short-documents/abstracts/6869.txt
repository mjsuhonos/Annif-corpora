The goal of this project was to research an electronic tennis officiating system that was low cost, accurate, and reliable. To do this, professional practices and literature were reviewed to identify what was already known and being implemented in the market. A basic proof of concept, in the form of a foot fault detecting system, was built in order to find out if a larger system could realistically be built. Then, a thorough investigation of components, including sensors, microcontrollers, wireless devices, cases, holders, and alert systems was performed to better understand the underlying technologies and suitability in a tennis officiating setting. Sensors were tested on a full-scale tennis court to identify the best possible option for a final design based on accuracy, cost, ease of use, set-up time, reliability, and size. Additionally, a plan to develop and commercialize the system was examined, taking into consideration relevant costs and restraints. Finally, a scale model of the full system was put together, showcasing the components previously studied and providing end users with an idea of how it would work.
