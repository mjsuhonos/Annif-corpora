    In recent years, the Ontario wine growing industry has gained significant recognition for its production of high quality wines. Closely reliant on the natural environment, this industry must manage its environmental, social and economic impacts in order to sustain successful long-term growth. This study identifies the environmental initiatives currently used and the main factors that influence their implementation. It also highlights the criteria that differentiate the number and type of initiatives undertaken. Key factors discovered to influence environmental commitment are wine quality, protection of the environment, leadership, financial considerations, regulatory compliance and practical knowledge. The presence of three criteria: 1) leadership with strong environmental values, 2) knowledge of financial benefits, and 3) accessible practical information regarding implementation lead to greater winery estate involvement and adoption of initiatives. This study proposes eight recommendations which could further improve environmental commitment in the Ontario wine growing industry.
