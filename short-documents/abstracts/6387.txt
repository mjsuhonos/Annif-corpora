Rapidly rising property values and shifts in living patterns have led to housing affordability pressures and gentrification in the Toronto neighbourhood of Parkdale. As a result, community groups are looking to find ways to preserve housing affordability through the creation of new housing units. This paper analyses policy tools that could potentially be used to generate affordable housing from new development. An understanding of current conditions was established and potential policy tools were identified. These include: inclusionary zoning, density benefit agreements, community benefit agreements, and community land trusts. A jurisdictional scan identified common themes and best practices for implementation of these policy tools. Interviews with key informants built upon this basis and provided insight into the applicability of these tools to Toronto. Recommendations were developed to assist community groups in responding to the implementation of these policies and to direct advocacy for further policy changes.
