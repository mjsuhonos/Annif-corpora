Elite athletes involved in weight-based sports are at increased risk of developing eating
disorders (EDs). While the utility of ED prevention programs has been assessed up to
three years post-intervention, it is unclear whether participation in such interventions
promotes any resilience against EDs in the long-term. To address this, the current study
assessed self-reported disordered eating and body dissatisfaction in ballet dancers 15 or
more years after participating in a reportedly successful ED prevention program at a
professional ballet school. Graduates of the school before, during, and after the
intervention were surveyed, and scores were compared across groups. Results revealed
dancers who participated in the intervention and those who attended post-intervention
endorsed fewer thoughts and behaviours associated with bulimia, had lower lifetime
prevalence of laxative use, and showed a trend toward lower lifetime rates of vomiting to
control weight than those who attended the ballet school prior to the intervention.
