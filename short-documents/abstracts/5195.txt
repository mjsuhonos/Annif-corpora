This qualitative research study employs narrative inquiry methods to both tell and explore the story of Zivvie (a pseudonym), a preschool child with severe disabilities, and her journey in becoming a full member of her learning community in an inclusive setting. The inquiry examines the changes in her social interactions with her peers resulting from the introduction of custom adaptive design objects, and how the use of adaptive designs provided Zivvie with a level of autonomy that enabled her to make choices about how she wanted to participate in her learning community. The inquiry also explores how the teacher’s role as observer and creator of accommodations for Zivvie within the learning environment facilitated the child’s development. Recommendations for future practice and research are identified.
