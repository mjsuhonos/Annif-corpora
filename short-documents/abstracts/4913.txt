This study recommends new simplified equations for the transverse moment and shear force at the base of the cantilever overhang due to applied vertical truck loading. This was made possible through a parametric study that utilized finite-element modelling on bridge deck cantilevers with variable lengths and slab thicknesses. Different end stiffening arrangements were considered that are encountered in practice, and included but were not limited to the PL-1, PL-2 and PL-3 New Jersey-type barriers walls, a PL-2 parapet, and a curb supporting intermittent steel posts carrying a guardrail. The barrier length changed from 3 to 12 m and the cantilever length ranged from 1.0 to 3.75 m. Further to the empirical expressions that had been developed, the study is supported by tables that were developed to readily design the cantilever slab, based on vertical loads due to vertical truck loading, as well as horizontal railing loads against the barrier wall.
