    Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an internationally recognized and scientifically based methodology to quantify the environmental impact of a product or service, typically from cradle-to-grave. The life cycle performance of housing is influenced by the interdependent nature of material and energy use, and dwelling location and service life. While much research has been conducted building LCA, its incorporation into regulation has been difficult to implement.
    This research outlines the methodology used to create an LCA database of new Canadian construction for the purpose of building stock modeling and benchmarking national construction practice, two key tools for higher level decision making. A software program has been developed to handle data storage and calculations. Results presented include general performance trends at various sector scales, and analysis comparing LCA to traditional environmental performance measurement, and sensitivity analysis of building material and operating energy fuel choice and energy efficiency measures.
