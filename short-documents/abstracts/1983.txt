    This thesis explores a technique for the fusion of streamed audio and video services for real-time applications. It discusses certain novel techniques used to overcome the problems with video and audio synchronization over the Internet of a tele-bot. We have developed a demonstration called the WAX, at the Network-Centric Applied Research Team (N-CART) laboratory located within the School of Computer Science at Ryerson University. WAX is equipped with an onboard camera and a microphone, as well as a 2.4 GHz wireless transceiver for transmitting video and audio feeds, and at the same time receiving commands from the WAX robot server. By launching a web browser and loading the Java client applets, a user can see as well as hear what is around WAX in near real-time, while being able to move the robot around its environment.
