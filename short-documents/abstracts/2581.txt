This applied thesis is focused on the full cataloguing and contextualizing of a collection of one hundred and sixteen postcards at the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) depicting scenes of Toronto a the beginning of the twentieth century.  Twenty-seven publishers representing international, national and regional manufacturers are identified with their imprint on the verso of the postcard.  The applied thesis includes a literature survey discussing a rationale for the cataloguing of postcards, as well as a brief overview of the history of  postcards and the history of the urbanization of the City of Toronto.  A description and analysis of the AGO postcards provides information about  the production cycle of postcards, the scope of commercial photography and the dissemination of photographic imagery in Toronto.  The thesis also examines the way images were altered in the production cycle and the manner in which photographers and publishers exchanged photographs intended for postcard production.
