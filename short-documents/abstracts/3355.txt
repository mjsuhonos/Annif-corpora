Our built environments have a direct correlation with our mental and physical health. This correlation is ever more evident with the process of ageing and the declining of neurological and physiological capacities of the human body. Architecture as Third Skin: Spatial Dimensions of Stimuli for Dementia Care thesis-project asserts that architecture, supported by evidence-based knowledge, can create an environment that triggers positive neurological changes in its users, negotiating the functional and social necessities of people with dementia in supporting their needs. The architectural model that informs this inquiry is explored through the design of a community-based Dementia Respite Care Centre, providing short and long term care as well as physical and mental therapy for those with early-to mid-stage dementia. Situated in Toronto, this thesis-project proposes a model that provides direct care for the specialized needs of dementia patients early in their illness condition to maintain independence and encourage living and ageing.
