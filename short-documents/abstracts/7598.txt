The process of converting a behavioral specification of an application to its equivalent system architecture is referred to as High Level-Synthesis (HLS). A crucial stage in embedded systems design involves finding the trade off between resource utilization and performance. An exhaustive search would yield the required results, but would take a huge amount of time to arrive at the solution even for smaller designs. This would result in a high time complexity. We employ the use of Design Space Exploration (DSE) in order to reduce the complexity of the design space and to reach the desired results in less time.

In reality, there are multiple constraints defined by the user that need to be satisfied simultaneously.
Thus, the nature of the task at hand is referred to as Multi-Objective Optimization. In this thesis,
the design process of DSP benchmarks was analyzed based on user defined constraints such as power
and execution time. The analyzed outcome was compared with the existing approaches in DSE and an
optimal design solution was derived in a shorter time period.
