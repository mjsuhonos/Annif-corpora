This project describes the design and testing of an attention-getting device, called HWAET (Hand Waving Apparatus for Effective Turn-Taking). HWAET was designed to be used by sign language participants to indicate their desire to have a turn to speak during a sign language interpreted video conference meeting with hearing participants. 
 User studies were conducted with ten sign language users, fifteen hearing subjects and four different sign language interpreters to examine the use of HWAET during a video conference. These studies showed that deaf participants using HWAET found it easier to indicate and take their turn independently than those relying solely on a sign language interpreter (not using HWAET). Also, interpreters commented that they did not have to manage turn-taking when HWAET was used compared to the control group (where HWAET was not used).
