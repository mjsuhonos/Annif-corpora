Warmth correlates with an inclusive feeling of comfort, both thermally and psychologically. Current practice is preoccupied with preventing heat loss and maintaining a constant temperature and relative level of humidity throughout spaces and does not consider occupancy. This mechanical approach considers warmth from an engineering perspective and does not take into account the human senses. An architectural approach to designing for warmth should on the other hand consider these senses. Ideally, it would create milieus that allow inhabitants to engage comprehensively with their space even as they experience awareness and appreciation of the thermal processes at work there. It is the goal of this thesis to develop viable architectural strategies to provide warmth.
