    Growing use of advanced materials (advanced high strength steel DP980 and ultralight-weight magnesium alloys) and innovative joining techniques (new-generation laser welding technology and weld bonding technique) is crucial for better fuel economy and lower CO2 emissions in automotive manufacturing. Microstructures and mechanical properties of fiber laser welded high strength low alloy and DP980 steel joints, weld-bonded Mg/Mg and Mg/steel joints and adhesive-bonded Mg/Mg joints were studied. Tempered martensite and welding concavity were observed in fiber laser welded DP980 joints which reduced fatigue resistance, while both HSLA and DP980 joints showed a superior tensile strength. Weld-bonded Mg/Mg and Mg/steel joints with an adhesive layer were significantly stronger than resistance spot welded Mg/steel joints. Reducing bonding length on weld bonded Mg/Mg joints led to a higher maximum tensile shear stress, both tensile and fatigue strength were slight lower than that of adhesive bonded Mg/Mg joints, while ability of energy absorption was equivalent. The tensile properties reduced at a higher temperature (90°C) but it increased at a lower temperature (-40°C).
