This study investigates the influence of cavity ventilation on the wind driven rain (WDR) performance of brick veneer walls. Two types of walls (type C and D) both bonded with N-type mortar were studied. The volume and frequency of WDR was based on weather station data from York University. Cavity conditions were mocked with a cavity chamber and ventilation was simulated with a fan providing air suction out of the cavity. Ventilation rates were simulated at 0, 5 and 10 ACH. Higher ventilation rates resulted in more efficient drying and lower RH within the cavity chamber. Wall type C exhibited more absorption with increased ventilation rates. Moisture content readings were generally irrelevant due to failure of the prescribed method. Measuring the influence of cavity ventilation on the amount of penetrated water should be further investigated by applying different ventilation rates to the same wall specimens to reduce the impact of physical variations within the same brick type.
