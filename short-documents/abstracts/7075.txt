The mixing quality of a solid-liquid stirred tank operating in the turbulent regime was investigated, numerically and to an extent experimentally. Simulations were performed by coupling Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The results were evaluated against experimental data obtained using Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT). This facilitated a novel and more rigorous assessment of CFD-DEM coupling â€“ i.e. based on the spatial distribution of particle concentrations. Furthermore, a new mixing index definition was developed to quantify suspension quality to work in tandem with existing dispersion mixing indexes. This provides a more complete interpretation of mixing quality. In this work, it was found that the model underestimated suspension and dispersion due to model limitations associated with mesh size and fluid-particle interaction models. Furthermore, the predicted mixing quality was sensitive to changes in the drag model, including other fluid-particle interaction forces in simulations, and variations in certain particle properties
