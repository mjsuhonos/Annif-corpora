This study illustrates that many second-generation members of the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora in Toronto display an identity of hybridity.  This is evidenced by their self-identification practices as well as their conscientiousness in navigating around dominant cultural values and the Canadian society's general lack of knowledge about their ethnic origin. It further shows that these diasporic members believe that successful navigation may result in greater equality and subsequent integration in the realms of economy and politics.  The results of this study confirm that hybridization instead brings about deception that the second-generation has the tools to re-negotiate power, when it is not the case - rather cultural ambivalence and ascription prevent the diaspora from challenging dominant cultures. In fact, the discourse on hybridity and its potential benefits may itself be a tool for the dominant group to reinforce oppressive power structures and uphold the barriers to true integration and equality.
