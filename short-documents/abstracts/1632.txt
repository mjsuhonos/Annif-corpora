    The Anchor impeller, which is a close clearance impeller, produces high shear near the vessel wall and is recommended for mixing of highly viscous fluids.  A thorough search of the literature suggests that few publications have beeen devoted to the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of mixing of non-Newtonian fluids with the anchor impeller.  Thus the objectives of this study are (i)to generate a 3-D flow field for mixing of yield-pseudoplastic fluid in a flat bottom cylindrical tank equipped with two-and four-blade anchor impellers using CFD modeling technique, (ii) to evaluate the effects of fluid rheology agitator speed, number of blades, vessel clearance and impeller blade width on power consumption, mixing time and flow patterns, and (iii) to determine the optimum value of clearance to diameter ratio and impeller blade width to diameter ratio on the basis of minimum mixing time.
    The study was carried out for a yield-stress pseudoplastic fluid, using a CFD package (Fluent), to simulate the 3-D flow domain generated in a cylindrical tank equipped with two-and four-blade anchor impellers.  The multiple reference frame (MRF) technique was employed to model the rotation of impellers. The rheology of the fluid was approximated using the Herschel-Bulkley model.  To validate the model, CFD results for the power were compared to experimental data.  After the flow fields were calculated, the simulations for tracer homogenization was performed to simulate the mixing time.  The effect of impeller speed, fluid rheology, and number of impellers on power consumption, mixing time, and flow pattern were explored. The optimum values of c/D (clearance to diameter) and w/D (impeller blade width to diameter) ratios were determined on the basis of minimum mixing time.
