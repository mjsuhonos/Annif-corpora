When it comes to the statical calculation and the design of the connection between reinforced concrete flat slabs and columns, the usual practice is to assume a hinged connection. However, in many cases this assumption does not reflect the actual behavior of the connection and a rigid design should be targeted in order to transfer the moments from the slab into the column. This project aims to develop adequate strut-and-tie models in order to find practical solutions on how to transfer the moments from flat slabs into their supporting columns or in other words how to design a rigid slab-column connection. Special emphasis is devoted to solutions for the use of precast columns because the arrangement of the reinforcement is often limited
