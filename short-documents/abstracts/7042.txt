Many studies in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) point to gesture-based interaction (GBI) as a transformative method for communicating with computers. GBI allows people to use common body language like waving or pointing to manipulate devices without physically touching them. Current research suggests that moving beyond traditional mechanical devices such as a mouse or keyboard may create richer and more ‘natural’ user experiences.
Despite this finding, this mode of interaction has not seen broadscale adoption. A critical analysis of the work taking place in both industry and HCI studies demonstrates tension between the theory and practice of creating gesture-centric interfaces. This study provides a critical overview of the issues, technological, design and social, that pose a challenge to the widescale adoption of this technology.
