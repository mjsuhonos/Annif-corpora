The early learning environment is important in the development of racial identity for Black and bi-racial children as this may be the first environment outside of the children’s home environment where they learn about themselves and others. Through semi-structured interviews this qualitative research explores five Black Canadian mothers’ racial socialization practices and perceptions of how their children’s racial identity is being represented in the early learning environment. Employing a constructivist framework and Critical Race Theory (CRT) four overarching themes were identified: “racial socialization behaviours connected to Black identity”, “parents using racial socialization to combat racism”, “lack of resources supporting racial identity”, and “diversity of teachers, authority belongs to everybody”. The mothers in this study employed racial socialization behaviours to buffer against the impact of racism in order to support the healthy development of their children.
