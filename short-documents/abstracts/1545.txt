    The Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor (MFB) has been identified as a system able to continuously monitor water quality through detection of changes in the movements of biota which may be caused by external stressors. In this study, behavioural changes of Daphnia magna and Hyalella azteca when exposed to tributyltin and atrazine were detected using the MFB. The applicability of the MFB to be used as a monitor of drinking water quality and the usefulness of the organisms in this automated system was determined. Neither contaminant brought about behavioural changes in either organism that were detectable by the MFB. While extensive literature indicated that this system was useful for field applications, this study concluded that the MFB is not yet able to detect contaminants entering a water system using the above test species. Future research is required to examine other species' ability to detect aquatic contaminants and the ability of the MFB to detect such responses.
