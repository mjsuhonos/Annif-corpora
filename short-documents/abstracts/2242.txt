    The literature indicates that aspects of culture have the potential to influence recovery from first episode schizophrenia (FES). The purpose of this study was to describe the infl uence of culture on the process of recovery for individuals with first episode schizophrenia. This study employed a qualitative descriptive methodology and elicited the experience of five male participants, who self-identified that culture influenced their recovery from FES. The three categories that emerged from the data are: ‘Emerging Cultural Identity,’ ‘Cultural Identity and Describing the Illness Experience,’ and ‘Cultural Identity: A Bridge to Recovery.’ A distinctive feature of this study is that participants turned toward their cultural identity to facilitate their process of recovery from a FES and maintain a positive sense of self. This study offers a preliminary understanding of the role of culture in recovery from FES and suggests implications for clinical practice, future research and theory.
