    The proposed electronic marketplace (EM) is aimed to enhance the procurement process by acting as an intermediary between buyers and suppliers. The proposed EM consists of users (buyers and suppliers), various components and a user interface. As part of the decision engine, a prototype supplier selection system, SupplySelect, is developed and implemented.
