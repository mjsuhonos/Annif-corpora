    Vibrations of the body: sounding out a way carves out a way to write in close proximity to creative work and embodied experience. The primary research examined in this paper is the group of four films and videos constructed by Angela Joosse during her Master's study. This body of work includes, Ear after ear (5 min. 16mm, 2D and 3D computer animation), City window (10 min. digital stills, digital video, computer annimation), 4C (7.5 min. digital video), and Shapes eat shapes (3 min. digital stills, computer animation).
    By working through an acoustic epistemology, this thesis proposes a means of including dynamic processes in writing and analysis. How might thinking, speaking and creating through metaphors of sound engender a more dynamic and embodied relation with being? Thinking through metaphors of sound necessarily includes elements of duration and modulation in time, as well as simultaneity and layering of disparate tones and textures.
