    Human trafficking policies in Canada, to date, focus primarily on border control and punitive measures against human traffickers. However, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) continue to point out that addressing the structural conditions that lead to such trafficking and respecting the human rights of trafficked persons is the most effective way of addressing the exploitation of trafficked persons. The difference in perspectives between government agencies and NGOs make developing a comprehensive and coherent response very difficult. However, continued incoherence of policy implementation is too costly to ignore. This paper compares the diverging perspectives of government policies and NGO approaches to international human trafficking in Canada. Such research is necessary in order to understand the ideas that inform the policies and to deconstruct the meanings of the policies. Moreover, this research will explore why policies are interpreted in diverging ways and explores how identities and norms interact to produce policies.
