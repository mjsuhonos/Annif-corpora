Over 1 000 000 Canadians are diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and by 2020 the disease will be the third
deadliest on Earth.

Despite high prevalence, diagnosis of COPD occurs late in the
disease course, after a large portion of the small airways are destroyed.

Current methods to quantify small airway disease (SAD) using the
Disease Probability Measure (DPM) approach requires CT images
acquired at full inspiration and full expiration, and therefore there are
technical challenges and dose concerns

Computed Tomography (CT) imaging using only a single full
inspiration CT image can be used segment the central airway tree and
generate quantitative morphometric measurements.
