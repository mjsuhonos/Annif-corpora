The objective of this practice-based master's research project is to explore how theory on photography, communication, and mythology can be illustrated by the format, layout, and design of a 120 page alternative fashion publication in such a way that it provides insight into the relationship between mythology and the fashion image and an alternative perspective on the fashion image that goes beyond profit-driven motives.  This project explores methods of collaboration and creativity by appropriating various works, personal projects, and those of contributors and collecting them into one context:  The Phoenix publication.  The methods of appropriation, d√©tournement, meta and corpse exquisite are used in the creation of this project in terms of individual submissions, layout, formatting, and the understanding of the publication as a whole.
