Ultra High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHP-FRC) was introduced in the mid-1990s and has made striking advances in recent years. DuctalÂ® is a UHP-FRC technology that offers a unique combination of characteristics including but, not limited to ductility, strength and durability, while providing highly moldable products with quality surfaces. Compressive strengths, and equivalent flexural strengths reach up to 200 and 40 MPa, respectively. UHP-FRC also shows an outstanding performance under dynamic loading in structures subjected to extreme loading conditions such as impact, earthquake and blast. Moreover, UHP-FRC indicates an optimized combination of properties for a specific application. Three series of tests including compression, indirect tension, and flexure were conducted under various strain rates from quasi-static to dynamic loading with low strain rates. The objective of this project is to enhance knowledge of strain rate effects on UHP-FRC with various fiber contents and to report Dynamic Increase Factor (DIF).
