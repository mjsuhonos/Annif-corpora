    In the present study, the behavior of various sizes of black powder particulates, carried by a turbulent flow of natural gas, is numerically predicated in a horizontal pipeline. The particles are magnetite and are considered as discrete or a dispersed phase; however, the gas phase is considered as a continuous phase. The numerical approach taken to simulate the dispersed phase is a Lagrangian approach, which is essentially computation of particles trajectories. The turbulence effect on the dispersion of the particles, due to turbulent eddies in the gas phase, is predicted using a stochastic discrete-particle approach. Several case studies have been examined and they include: instantaneous injection of diverse particle sizes, continuous injection of five different particle sizes and multiple injection. For the case with instantaneous injection, it has been found that sudden injection of relatively high mass loading of particles would alter the flow profile in the core region and subsequently increases the turbulent intensity. For all cases it has been found that most particles in the core region of the flow move faster than the gas. Also, for all studied cases, the velocity profiles of gas and particles, at different pipeline stations, have been presented and analyzed.
