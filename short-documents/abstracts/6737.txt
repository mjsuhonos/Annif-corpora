This thesis explores the use and development of the photographically illustrated novel from a souvenir to a mass-market publication. An examination of three volumes of the Tauchnitz printing of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Marble Faun details how tourists and booksellers adapted the novel through the addition of albumen prints to create a unique
souvenir. By 1889, the technological advances in the printing process, the demands of tourism and the photographic selections from the Tauchnitz volumes made it possible for Houghton, Mifflin and Company to publish an illustrated copy of The Marble Faun containing photogravure prints. Like the European title of the book - Transformation or
,the Romance of Monte Beni - this paper demonstrates how the Tauchnitz touristproduced souvenir copies of the novel evolved into a mass-market product.
