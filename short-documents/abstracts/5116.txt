This research work demonstrated that laser-induced reverse transfer (LIRT) can be used for controllable site-specific  deposition of fibrous nanostructure.  The LIRT method makes it achievable to generate and deposit fibrous nanostructure of a wide variety of materials on a transparent acceptor in a single-step process at an ambient condition.  The deposition of fibrous nanostructure was conducted using ultrafast laser ablation of silicon and aluminum targets placed behind a glass acceptor.  Femtosecond laser pulses pass through the transparent acceptor and hit the bulk donor.  Consequently a mass quantity of nanoparticles ablates from the donor and then aggregates and forms a porous fibrous nanostructure on the transparent acceptor.  Our experiments demonstrated that the gap between the target and the glass acceptor was critical in the formation and accumulation of nanofibers and it determines the density of the formed nanostructure.  The formation mechanism of the nanostructures can be explained by the well-established theory of vapor condensation within the plume induced by ultrafast laser ablation.  Experimental results also show that the length of the nanostructure can be controlled by the gap between the target and glass acceptor.  Lastly, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis shows the oxygen concentration in the nanofibrous structure which is associated with oxidation of ablated material at ambient atmosphere.
