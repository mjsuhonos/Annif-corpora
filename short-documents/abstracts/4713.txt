We report a wavelength-switchable single-polarization dissipative soliton (DS) mode-locked fiber laser using a chirped fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for spectral filtering. The chirped FBG, when inserted into the ring cavity, provides a stopband from 1045 nm to 1057 nm, which is used for spectral filtering in this all-normal-dispersion mode-locked Yb-doped fiber laser. The combination of the chirped FBG and the Yb gain profile help the formation of the DS. The laser delivers wavelength-switchable and polarized (28 dB) DS of 6.1 nJ and 29 ps at 1032 nm, and 4.3 nJ and 24 ps at 1068 nm, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the direct proof that a bandpass filter is not indispensible to achieve stable DS in ps fiber lasers.
