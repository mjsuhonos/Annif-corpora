    With the emergence of wireless devices, service delivery for ad-hoc networks has started to attract a lot of attention recently. Ad-hoc networks provide an attractive solution for networking in the situations where network infrastructure or service subscription is not available. We believe that overlay networks, particularly peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, is a good abstraction for application design and deployment over ad-hoc networks. The principal benefit of this approach is that application states are only maintained by the nodes involved in the application execution and all other nodes only perform networking related functions. On the other hand, data access applications in Ad-hoc networks suffer from restricted resources. In this thesis, we explore how to use Cooperative Caching to improve data access efficiency in Ad-hoc network. We propose a Resource-Aware Cooperative Caching P2P system (RACC) for data access applications in Ad-hoc networks. The objective is to improve data availability by considering energy of each node, demand and supply of network. We evaluated and compared the performance of RACC with Simple Cache, CachePath and CacheData schemes. Our simulation results show that RACC improves the  lay of query as well as energy usage of the network as compared to Simple Cache, CachePath and CacheData.
