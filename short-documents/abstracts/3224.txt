There has been limited research in the field of fashion blogs. This study attempts to begin filling this void by examining fashion blogs from the userâ€™s perspective as they relate to other forms of fashion media. From the uses and gratifications perspective, this study employs a qualitative investigation to identify the motivational factors for fashion blog use. A two-step process, made up from an initial online questionnaire and in-depth interviews was used. The online questionnaire was answered by 247 women between the ages of 18 and 35. Respondents for the second portion of the study, the in-depth interviews, were made up of 10 women who had previously participated in the questionnaire. Three new motivational factors were identified: habit, entrance, and retrieve/save content. Adhering to the belief that new media technologies supplement rather than succeed one another, these findings have been explained in relation to the use of fashion magazines.
