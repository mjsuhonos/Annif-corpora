As a result of todayâ€™s accelerated culture, the omnipresence of speed has taken over everyday life. The influence of flexibility and efficiency within contemporary architecture parallels the need for speed. The  primacy of speed has hindered the temporal and cognitive presence in everyday life; shifting the human experience of the world from lived to measured. Through the reconsideration of slowness as an embodied experience, the rhythmic passage of the body through space establishes a mindful physical presence as opposed to modern distraction. In architecture, spatial and perceptual unfolding intertwines perceiver and perceived to sequentially reveal the layers of experience through passage. Within slowness, visual fluidity creates a viscous and emotive relationship between mind, body, form, and movement. The relationship between speed, time, and presence, guides the mindful body through a layered procession which unfolds in the creation of an architecture of slowness.
