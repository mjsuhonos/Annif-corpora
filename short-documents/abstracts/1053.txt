    This thesis presents a Virtual Cadaver system, ViC, which allows users to interactively “cut open” and visualize a highly realistic representation of 3D human anatomy, including skin, muscles, bones, arteries and many other anatomical systems and structures. ViC’s interaction and visualization functionality, coupled with a multi-touch interface, provide real-time cutaway operations using simple and familiar gestures.
    To support the cutaway feature, ViC’s 3D human anatomy dataset is preprocessed, breaking up the large anatomy system data meshes into smaller, more manageable mesh “fragments”. The shape of each fragment is crafted to support semantically meaningful cutaways while the “granularity” of the fragments supports interaction efficiency. ViC uses game technology to enable highly realistic rendering of human anatomy. Furthermore, ViC’s performance and cutaway capabilities were evaluated on consumer-grade hardware to confirm that real-time interaction and visualization with highly-responsive multi-touch input actions can be achieved.
