This paper proposes a digital game concept designed to increase the millennial generationâ€™s level of engagement with the campaign for nuclear disarmament. It discusses four key research findings that support the need for the development of this game, and provides helpful information to enable better understanding of the relatively specialized inspiring concepts. The paper argues that activist campaigns should design nuanced communication plans that consider the complexities of the issue and leverage the digital media tools whose affordances best match the goals of the campaign. In the case of nuclear disarmament, I propose a campaign communication strategy in the form of a
pervasive social impact game, called 3 Minutes to Midnight, as an effective way to ignite widespread public support in the 21st century.
