    This Professional Research Project evaluates GoldSET*, a sustainability decision support tool developed by Golder Associates Ltd., and its use in the decision making process for assessing the sustainability implications of engineering projects. A qualitative evaluation of the effectiveness of the decision support tool was carried out including the development of recommendations. Establishing sustainability practices within corporate operations and engineering projects is an important nonmarket factor for the global business community. Corporations need to present themselves as environmentally conscientious as well as being socially and financially stable to unlock market opportunities. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plays a role in creating and maintaining sustainability practices through measurement, reporting and evaluation processes. Firms are continuously faced with engineering project decision opportunities and there is a need for viable decision support tools, such as GoldSET, to assist in achieving corporate sustainability objectives and goals.
