This study provides a unique perspective on health care and emergency shelter services for older women dealing with homelessness as well as complex health care needs in the city of Toronto. Qualitative interviews with frontline shelter
staff highlight the assumption that older women who are discharged from hospital will be cared for in an institutional setting such as an emergency shelter. Discussion focuses on how this assumption fails to adequately meet the needs of older women and how lack of adequate housing has a negative impact on their access to healthcare.
