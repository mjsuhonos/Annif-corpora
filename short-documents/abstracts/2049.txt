    Steel plate bonding technology is widely accepted for the strengthening of reinforced concrete structures. Researches in the past showed that epoxy bonded steel plated composite beams are highly prone to variation in temperature and environmental conditions. This research study introduces a novel approach to steel plate composite beam in which bond between the concrete and the steel plate is provided by welding the steel plate to the legs of the uniformly spaced stirrups. Experimental investigation showed that the parameters such as interface connections, geometric dimensions, stirrups spacing and thickness of steel plate have a great influence on the strength, deformation and failure characteristics of such composite beams. A finite element model has been developed using commercial software, ABAQUS, to predict the strength of such composite beams and its performance is validated through experimental results. The direct finite element simulation of proposed composite beams with developed finite element model gives an average of experimental to predicted strength ratio of 0.99, which comfirms the accuracy of prediction. The finite element model is then used to simulate a large number of numerical beams with varying geometric and material properties to formulate design guidelines. Design charts are developed and their performance is validated through test results with experimental to design chart predictions giving an average value of 0.94. Design procedures for such beams are illustrated with calculated design examples. Such simple design procedures can be adopted in the actual design of proposed composite beams in practical applications.
