    The current study examined the relationship of demographic and psychological predictors to fertility intentions in HIV+ women in Ontario. 326 HIV+ women between the ages of 18 and 52 were recruited through 28 AIDS service organizations, 8 HIV clinics and 2 community health centres across the province. 58.6% of the sample intended to become pregnant. African ethnicity, living in Toronto, high social support for having a child, and high perceived HIV stigma were associated with higher fertility intentions. Higher age, and European, Canadian and British ethnicity were all associated with lower fertility intentions. No moderation effects were found in multiple regression analyses, but main effects were found for African ethnicity, lower age, living in Toronto, high perceived HIV stigma and high social support for having a child. The majority of the sample intended to become pregnant, suggesting the need for effective health care support for HIV+ women in Ontario.
