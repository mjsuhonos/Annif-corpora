This research project will focus on the use of social marketing tactics for the purpose of environmental issues. More specifically, it will examine how environmental discourse, social marketing, and social cognitive theory influence modern marketing of the environment. In using a representative case study analysis, the project will directly compare a for-profit environmental campaign with a nonprofit environmental campaign.
Text and image analysis will be used as the primary methodologies, providing insight into any noticeable differences or similarities that may exist between the for-profit and nonprofit approaches. Conclusions address the tactics, strengths and weaknesses of both parties, and provide considerations for improving the effectiveness of environmental marketing campaigns moving forward.
