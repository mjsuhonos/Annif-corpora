From July 1, 2012, until July 31, 2014, Canada's immigration system underwent significant transformations, and the changes are continuing at a very fast pace.  These transformations and the ongoing changes have created a cloud of uncertainty for many prospect immigrants and unpredictability among policy analysts, non-state actors, scholars, and other stakeholders.  While family reunification, economic migrants and refugees in the past have enabled Canada to step up as a global leader, today concerns are growing that recent policy shifts are making Canada less desirable, are unfair to migrant and their families, and are resulting in destruction of its international reputation and long held leadership in immigrant integration and settlement.  The purpose of this paper is to build upon Alboim and Cohl's Maytree report and review both proposed and effective immigration policies that occurred between July 2012 and July 2014.  Offering an in depth analysis regarding  some of the major policy amendments and evaluate their potential impact on all involved parties.
