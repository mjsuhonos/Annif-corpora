    This study is focused on the immigration related experiences of Russian Jews who left the Former Soviet Union for Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s and arrived in Toronto in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It explores the unique character of this cohort, their settlement in Toronto as well as their identities and transnational practices. During the last two decades of the 20th century there has been a continuous influx of Russian Jews from Israel to Toronto. This ongoing immigrant cohort has become the major source of recent Jewish immigrants to Toronto. It is usually referred as "a secondary migration of Russian Jews". This cohort of Russian Jews has notable features which have affected their adjustment and integration in Toronto. The study draws on a variety of sources including the examination of academic literature, media articles, personal observations, and interviews with recent immigrants.
