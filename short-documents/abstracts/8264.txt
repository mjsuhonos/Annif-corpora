This study illustrates the potential opportunity for the utilization of hemp to produce PHB (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate). The objective of the study was to optimize simple sugar availability from hemp for Ralstonia eutropha. The use of three pre-treatment methods (grinded – 5% NaOH – Autoclave at 121 oC for 60 minutes) was able to provide a better fractional insoluble solids (FIS) of ≃ 61 % that was significantly better compared to other combinations of pre-treatments studied. Optimum enzyme dosage was also determined by comparing different enzyme concentrations and found that three enzymes should contain a dose of 1.5 g /L. The optimum pretreatment and hydrolysis conditions resulted in a better enzyme hydrolysis yield of 10.9 % and PHB yield of ≃ 43 %. Results also demonstrate that sonification did not improve PHB recovery, while pH control increased PHB recovery.  Keywords: Hemp, Ralstonia eutropha, PHB, Pre-treatment, Enzyme Hydrolysis
