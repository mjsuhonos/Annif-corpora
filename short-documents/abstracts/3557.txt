Histones H3/H4 are deposited onto DNA in a replication-dependent or independent fashion by the CAF1 and HIRA protein complexes. Despite the identification of these protein complexes, mechanistic details remain unclear. Recently, we showed that in T. thermophila histone chaperones Nrp1, Asf1 and the ImpÎ²6 importin  function together to transport newly synthesized H3/H4 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. To characterize chromatin assembly proteins in T.thermophila, I used affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry to identify protein-protein interactions of Nrp1, Cac2 subunit of CAF1, HIRA and histone modifying Hat1-complex in T. thermophila. I found that the three-subunit T.thermophila CAF1 complex interacts with Casein Kinase 2 (CKII), possibly accounting for previously reported human CAF1phosphorylation. I also found that Hat2 subunit of HAT1 complex is also shared by CAF1 complex as its Cac3 subunit. This suggests that Hat2/Cac3 might exist in two separate pools of protein complexes. Remarkably, proteomic analysis of Hat2/Cac3 in turn revealed that it forms several complexes with other proteins including SIN3, RXT3, LIN9 and TESMIN, all of which have known roles in the regulation of gene expression. Finally, I asked how selective forces might have impacted on the function of proteins involved in H3/H4 transport. Focusing on NASP which possesses several TPR motifs, I showed that its protein-protein interactions are conserved in T. thermophila. Using molecular evolutionary methods I show that different TPRs in NASP evolve at different rates possibly accounting for the functional diversity observed among different family members.
