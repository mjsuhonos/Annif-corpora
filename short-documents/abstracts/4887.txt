Protein glycosylation is the most abundant and diverse protein modification that
occurs in all domains of life. It is defined as the covalent attachment of a
carbohydrate moiety to a specific amino acid on a target protein. The functional role
of this attachment is implicated in and spans various cell processes from cell
signaling, cell defense, and pathogenesis â€“ to name a few. A specific type of protein
glycosylation, called protein O-mannosylation (POM) is a process found to be
conserved from bacteria to man. In humans, POM is required for healthy cell
function, and the absence of POM can cause fatal diseases. Certain prokaryotic
species possess a related POM system, but it is poorly understood. It is our
hypothesis that the analysis of the POM system in simpler organisms can aid in the
characterization of this process and the functional role of the mannosylated proteins
that are produced. However, the protocols to prove this theory do not yet exist. This
thesis establishes a collection of developed protocols that can be used to
characterize the POM systems from gram-positive species Corynebacterium
glutamicum and Cellulomonas fimi. In addition the first ever evidence of a C. fimi
glycoprotein being glycosylated by the endogenous C. glutamicum POM system is
provided.
