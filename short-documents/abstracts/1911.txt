    Film cooling has been studied for many decades but the study of film cooling using surface enhancements is still relatively new. In this project numerical analysis has been carried out to find the film cooling performance of ramp, flow aligned blocker, and trench surface enhancements in comparison to the standard elliptical injection configuration. A comparative study of the effects of the blowing ratio has also been carried out for each surface enhancement configuration. In addition to calculating and discussing the centerline and laterally averaged film cooling effectiveness results, detailed analysis of the flow and temperature field of each configuration is also presented. In the end the laterally averaged film cooling effectiveness results suggested that flow aligned blockers would provide the greatest film cooling improvements with closer hole spacing.
