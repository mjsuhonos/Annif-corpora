Ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems are an extremely efficient space heating and cooling
technology. There is a large consensus throughout the literature that GSHP systems can reduce
operational CO2 emissions by up to 80% in comparison to natural gas furnace (GF) and air
conditioner (AC) systems. The literature is limited; however, in regards to the specific
environmental impacts associated with the systems, as well as the impacts that occur throughout
the systemsâ€™ entire life cycle. In this project, a comparative life cycle assessment was conducted
to compare a GSHP system with a GF/AC system, examining 14 specific environmental impact
categories. Results were consistent with the literature in regards to the operational stage; however
the GSHP system displayed a significantly greater overall environmental impact. While these
results are specific to the region of Ontario, Canada, they call into question the prevailing opinion
that GSHPs are the more environmentally sustainable option.
