    Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the de-facto inter-domain routing protocol in the Internet, which involves exchange of routing information among the ASes that is used by the routers in an AS to compute paths to destination address blocks or prefixes in the Internet. The BGP is a path-vector and policy-based routing that allows each AS to independently define a set of local policies for route selection. However, since routes are selected based on local policies of the ASes, it might cause global conflicts or network topology disputes among the ASes. In this thesis, first we present a survey and in-depth analysis of the existing available solutions and their implementations for the BGP policy induced faults. Then, we discuss the tool we have developed for identifying the BGP faults or route instability within an autonomous system due to local policy. Finally, we propose a new solution to detect and eliminate the route oscillation in the BGP best path selection process due to local policy conflicts among ASes. We also present the test cases that we developed using BGP simulator for simulating oscillation faults in the test-bed and then discuss their results.
