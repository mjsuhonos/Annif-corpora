Through practice-led research entitled Modern Shibori: Beyond Handcrafted Tradition, I explore the contemporary relevance of shibori – an ancient Japanese resist-dye method – in the context of present day Canada. The research employs a hybrid cultural products framework to aid in the contextualization and analysis of a series of artworks, intended to disseminate concepts related to craft culture and sustainability. The aim of Modern Shibori is to blur the perceived line between craft and fine art and to help encourage continued practice of the ancient textile technique. The outcome of the project is a cohesive body of contemporary work that is explorative, yet pays homage to traditional shibori, and uses materials with low environmental impact.
