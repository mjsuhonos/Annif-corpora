This research makes a case for the importance of children-specific non-fiction media
content in a digital age. Drawing from my professional experience making children’s television,
I piloted a media education and video production curriculum with a grade eight class at an
independent, all-girls school in Toronto, Canada. This paper contextualizes my research by
outlining the informing framework of participatory culture and several related concepts which
intersect media studies, children’s culture, and pedagogy; it also presents my reflections on
creating and testing the curriculum. To both complement my creative research-as-practice and
participatory action research approach and chronicle the research project, I created a website
(http://betweenproductions.wixsite.com/comcult). It features curriculum materials and research
documents, including samples of the students’ work and their reflections; I also produced a short
video that incorporates a mix of student and researcher video footage to illustrate one group’s
experience creating their final project.
