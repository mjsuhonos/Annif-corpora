    All species of sea turtles are globally endangered, largely due to the impact of unsustainable tourism. Gili Trawangan, a small island, depends on marine tourism and has an abundant population of sea turtles. Stakeholder collaboration is often used to promote sustainable tourism development and sea turtle conservation. This study examined stakeholder collaboration to promote conservation in sea turtle tourism in small islands by exploring a case study in Gili Trawangan, Indonesia. The study was conducted in 2010. It applied qualitative research methods to expand the knowledge of collaboration in the development of sustainable tourism in small islands. Stakeholder analysis helped to reveal barriers to and influences on tourism development to help promote sea turtle conservation and protect the livelihoods of local communities. Key findings are that education, financial considerations, management structure, regulatory conflict, a disconnect to the island, and stakeholder conflict are factors that influenced stakeholder collaboration in Gili Trawangan.
