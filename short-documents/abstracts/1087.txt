    Parallel computing techniques are applied to a linear acoustic wave model to reduce execution time. Three parallel computing models are developed to parallelize computations. The fork-and-join, SPMD and SIMT models define the execution of parallel computations. The precision and efficiency of the linear acoustic wave model are improved through substantial speedups in all implementations. Furthermore, axisymmetric properties of certain acoustic fields lead to a reduction in the spatio-temporal complexity of those acoustic fields by removing redundant computations. The same linear acoustic wave model is also modified and extended to describe wave propagation across multiple media instead of only a single medium. The developed implementations are integrated into a particularly useful package for high performance simulation of two- or three-dimensional linear acoustic elds generated by realistic sources in various fluid media.
