Two echelon cold supply chain model is developed in which warehouse and retailer are the two main actors of supply chain. The model is based on energy consumption cost for chiller system and the stochastic lead time. To incorporate the quality degradation, global stability index (GSI) method is used. The objective is to analyze the effect of retailerâ€™s storage temperature and nutritional index weightage on the total cost of supply chain. A breakdown structure of all the associated costs is developed to formulate the total cost of cold chain. A numerical example is used for better understanding. To find the optimal solution, the model is numerically solved by using matlab genetic algorithm. The sensitivity analysis is being performed to study the model behavior against different parameters.
