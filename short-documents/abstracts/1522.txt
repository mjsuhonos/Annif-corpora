    The purpose of this project is to conduct an analysis of sustainable food system (SFS) projects implemented at Canadian universities. An inventory of SFS projects on Canadian university campuses was developed through a detailed content analysis of university websites. Gaps in the existing programs were explored through interviews with representatives from 40 of the 201 identified SFS projects. The interviews addressed project operations, definitions, motivations, approvals processes, challenges, lessons learned, project future, links to other projects, suggestions to other projects, and additional comments. These interviews found that even across different SFS project categories, there are strong common lessons and suggestions that can be applied to other existing or new projects, such as channeling passion into starting projects despite the obstacles faced, and building support networks. These results will help other SFS projects in their quest to address the environmental, social, and economic challenges faced by the parts of the food system: production, processing, access, distribution, consumption, and waste management.
