A total of 15 energy (natural gas) audits were conducted for industrial sites from food processing, packaged goods and finishing processes (powder coating) sector. Natural gas consumptions, performances of major gas consuming equipment and savings from proposed energy measures were analyzed for the audited sites. Proposed energy saving measures included reduction in non-productive consumption, tune-up of gas-fired equipment, optimization of boiler loads, heat recovery through feedwater economizer and reduction in oven exhaust using variable frequency drives (VFDs). Gas savings achieved by employing VFDs showed great potential ranging from 13% to 49% of oven consumptions while savings for feedwater economizer ranged from 3.4% to 18.4% of boiler consumptions. Other measures mentioned above, though relatively simpler to implement, also showed potential of considerable savings. Associated fuel cost savings and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions were also estimated. Furthermore, a MATLAB program was created to calculate boiler efficiencies.
