    A sociocultural study hypothesised Chinese parents in Canada would express values informed by filial piety. The extent to which filial piety characteristics informed parenting values, the extent to which family characteristics related to parenting values and the extent to which families felt their values were reflected in Canadain pareting literature were explored. Questions were asked to highlight the problematic nature of Developmentally Appropriate Practice's universalistic approach to development.
    Survey research involved 30 participants' questionnaire responses. Results were mixed. Parents expressed an independent orientation regarding goals; whereas, values were consistent with filial piety. Agreement with parenting literature was marginal. Most research is needed to examine whether a hegemonic ideology contributes to Chinese parents goals; Chinese parents reported values informed by filial piety. No previous studies were found specifically investigating Canadian parents of Chinese origin. Potential benefits include indentifying barriers to partnership and opportunities to develop awareness of global parenting goals.
