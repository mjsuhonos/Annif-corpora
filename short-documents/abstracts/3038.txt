A numerical analysis of effectiveness of micro-jet impingement cooling on leading edge of a turbine vane is presented.  An axisymmetric single round jet was assessed for its ability and consistency as a preliminary study including the investigation of parameters influencing the heat transfer distribution.
The analysis revealed that an increase in Nusselt number was attributed to increase in Reynolds number, decrease in jet diameter and H/D < 3.  Significant improvement in heat transfer was observed for tapering nozzle configuration.
The study was then further expanded to 3D analysis of leading edge cooling of turbine vane.  Effect of nozzle diameter to micro-scale was studied, which showed 65% enhancement in the heat transfer rates.
