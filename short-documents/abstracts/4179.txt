Canada continues to be among the world’s most ‘wired’ countries. Life in urban Canada is fueled
by high-speed wireless connectivity, shifting brick-and-mortar services to cyberspace including
banking, shopping and socializing. However, rural Canada is still catching-up on such
technological advancement as a result of little investment in the digital infrastructure by the
telecommunications sector to elude lower ROI, causing a Digital Divide. This Digital Divide
poses an opportunity to be bridged by bringing rural Canada to cyberspace and giving them an
equal opportunity to thrive.

As cloud technology has disrupted many key sectors including business and social exchange; the
Education sector still has not been able to fully utilize the massive opportunity cloud offers as a
valuable platform for delivering education to remote Canada. My MRP focuses on the feasibility
of delivering online education through the effective use of cloud technology in Canada’s key
northwestern area called Yukon.
