    This Masterâ€™s Research Paper investigates and discusses issues of regionalism in Canada and the subsequent problems related to the fashion industry due to fragmentation. The paper explores concepts of national identity as it relates to the construction of fashion capitals as a marketing tool to encourage economic growth through brand loyalty. This concept is developed to suit the current issues and needs in marketing Canadian-designed fashion domestically and globally. Twenty-two fashion professionals were interviewed and asked to discuss the current atmosphere of Canadian fashion culture, design communities, and the importance of the internet as a marketing tool; these interviews laid the foundation for a proposal of regional integration developed through an online platform with emphasis on social interaction among users.
