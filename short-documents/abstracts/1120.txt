    Support for the use of evidence-based psychological practice in Canada is growing, but there remains a large gap between psychotherapy research and real-world psychotherapy practice. There also exists a chasm between the number of clinicians who attend psychotherapy trainings and those who implement the training material into their clinical practice. The present study examined individual provider characteristics in the uptake of Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. There was a trend for an interaction between attitudes toward manualized treatments and attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat individuals with PTDS. Specifically, as attitudes in each area were more positive, piecemeal uptake of the protocol decreased. Contrary to hypothesis, prior training in couple therapy or in cognitive-behavioural therapy for PTDS, years since the highest degree was completed, and therapeutic orientation were not associated with uptake.
