A ground source heat pump (GSHP) is a system that uses the ground as a heat source/sink to provide heating/cooling to a conditioned space.                                                                                                                                                                     During the winter, a GSHP uses a heat pump cycle to move heat from the ground into a space in order to heat it In the summer, the space is cooled as heat is pumped out of the space and back into the ground GSHPs are a sustainable alternative to conventional HVAC systems because they do not rely on direct fossil fuel consumption, and they are highly efficient as they move heat rather than generate it In addition, the temperature of the ground remains constant throughout the year, resulting in a greater thermal efficiency, and therefore less energy consumption
