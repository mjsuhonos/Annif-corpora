The purpose of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of how a mobile app integrating augmented reality and GPS technology can influence crowd behaviour in the themed entertainment industry. In partnership with Dr. Asgary, Associate Professor of Disaster & Emergency Management at York University and a member ADERSIM, the study was conducted on the AnyLogic Simulation system to measure how Disney characters can act as a crowd mitigation tool to influence crowd movements throughout the Magic Kingdom. Using data to represent park entrance rates, attraction duration, and wait times, the study was able to capture the level of influence Disney characters had on park guestâ€™s movements throughout their visit. This simulation reveals that Disney characters have the ability to influence crowd behaviour with a probability rate of approximately 30%. This data supports the view that the proposed mobile app will act as an effective crowd mitigation tool and can strategically influence crowd migration throughout the Magic Kingdom.
