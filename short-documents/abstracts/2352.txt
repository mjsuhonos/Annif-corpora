    As Ontario bridge infrastructure enters the era of maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement, prefabricated bridge systems will certainly have many advantages as compared to the conventional systems. Prefabricated systems can be quickly assembled and the traffic can be opened in a very short period of time, minimizing the lane closure time, reducing the cost and design time, and minimizing forming and labour work. The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code specifies simplified design method for slab-on-girder bridges in the form of moment and shear distribution factors. This thesis presents a parametric study, using the finite-element method, on a series of precast Wide-Flange CPCI girder bridges to examine the applicability of the CHBDC load distribution factors to this prefabricated bridge system. The parameters considered in this study include span length, number of lanes, number of girders, live load conditions, presence of intermediate diaphragms, and type of connections between individual girders. This study revealed that CHBDC load distribution factors generally overestimate the structural response of such bridges. As a result, a refined set of load distribution factor equations were developed.
