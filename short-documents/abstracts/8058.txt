Perpetual Shift, a responsive art installation, exists at the intersection of digital media, art and architecture, bearing a range of connections to the realm of ubiquitous computing and adding to evolving perspectives in the fields of installation art and interactive architecture by proposing a new mode of engaging with data through the physical built environment.                   
The physical embodiment of the sculpture has the functional properties of a Tangible User Interface and employs an innovative approach to material application to generate multi-modal dynamic output (sight and sound). Though as a device Perpetual Shift is capable of being programmed to function as a form of data-physicalization, this artwork is a form of data-sculpture whereby location of the human body is interpreted as data which drives the actuation of the built environment.
