This project presents complexity analysis and hardware implementation of extensible modulo addition [15] encryption algorithm on a 32-bit lightweight FPGA based block cipher called INFLEX, which is designed for the internet of things (IoT) environment, supporting 64-bits key. It is designed for constrained hardware resources yet providing a highly secure scalable configuration for the variety of applications. This characteristic is obtained by the use of generalized Feistel structure combined with an improved block inflation feature. INFLEX follows a typical ARX (Add, Rotate, XOR) round function with a distinguished feature of block expansion and collapse as per user selected control string, which makes INFLEX act as a tweakable Cipher. We have shown comparison of INFLEX algorithm robustness and immunity against linear and differential attacks and demonstrated that it outperforms one of the benchmark block Ciphers Speck32/64 proposed by national security agency (NSA).
