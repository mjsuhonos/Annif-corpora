This commentary describes an approach for delivering television content to mobile phones in Canada using over-the-air broadcast signals. Over-the-air television broadcasting to mobile phones is available to our American neighbours but has not been implemented in Canada. We report on a test of mobile TV services, demonstrating access to U.S. signals from Canada. While it is technically feasible to deliver over-the-air mobile broadcasting in Canada, it is likely that vertical integration in the broadcasting and communications sectors is creating barriers to the development of this service. The commentary concludes with some thoughts on how mobile digital television services could be developed for Canadian viewers.
