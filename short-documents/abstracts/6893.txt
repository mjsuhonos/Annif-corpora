An effective way to enhance the heat dissipation in industrial heat transfer devices is impinging of the fluid jet. Due to the higher dissipation heat flux, jet flows can be used for to control the temperature of high intensity heat sources.

Traditional fluids such as water, ethylene and propylene glycol, and oils offer heat transfer capabilities that are adequate for many applications. There are several options to increase the effectiveness of the heat transfer characteristics for these fluids, for instance, using jet flows, and increasing the surface area of the heat transfer object. However, with the advances in nanotechnology and material science, nanofluids offer an attractive alternative option. Nanofluids refer to a dispersion of metallic or non-metallic particles with dimensions smaller than 100 nm in a base fluid like water, ethylene and propylene glycol, oil. Nanofluids have been shown to have an enhanced heat transfer characteristic, because of their high thermal conductivity.

In this Project, Heat transfer enhancement of an impinging liquid jet on a V-shape target plate cooling system, has been investigated numerically, by replacing the base fluid, water, with Al2O3–water nanofluid. To conduct the research, literature review on nanofluid heat transfer enhancement, jet impingement, and nanofluids jet impingement, has been conducted. Numerical model has been built using ANSYS Workbench 16.0. After validating the numerical code with the previous experimental data, the effect of nanoparticles volume fraction, jet-surface distance and jet’s Reynolds number on the heat transfer enhancement has been investigated
