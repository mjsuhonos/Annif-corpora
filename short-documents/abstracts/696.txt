    The negatives in the Toronto Telegram fonds (1876-1971), at the Clara Thomas Archives and Special Collections at York University, in Toronto, Canada are representative of eras in history and are of great historical, geographic and intrinsic value. The declining condition of the negatives is of significant concern for the longevity of these photographic artifacts. The fundamental value this fonds has to support research and teaching at the Clara Thomas Archives and Special Collections, York University Library and York University must be recognized. My research concentrates on the 830,000 negatives, which include glass plate, cellulose nitrate, and cellulose acetate materials, all suffering from minor to severe forms of chemical and physical degradation. Vinegar syndrome is a major problem; the consequences of which are permanently deformed cellulose acetate negatives. This case study investigates the deteriorating condition of each type of negative within this fonds, and suggests appropriate measures for decelerating degradation.
