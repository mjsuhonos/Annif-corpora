    Testing methods based on residue codes are considered as simple, with high probability of detecting errors. Most of the literatures on arithmetic error control codes are mainly focused on applications of secure data transmission and testing digital circuits rather than testing mixed-signal systems. In both cases implementation of residue computing circuit (RCC), also known as the residue generator is an integral part of the hardware design. In this work a low-cost compactor circuit to calculate the residue for on-line testing of analog-to-digital converter has been presented. Aliasing rate and its relationship with the resolution of the ADC have been analyzed. Theory and operation of Linear Feedback Shift Registers have been applied for the implementation of the modulo adder circuit. The compaction circuits were simulated, and the result confirmed the theoretical analysis.
