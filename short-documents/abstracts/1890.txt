    IEEE 802.16/WiMAX wireless technology is designed to provide broadband wireless access (BWA). WiMAX PMP is envisioned to provide last-mile Internet access as well as backhaul for SOHO (Small office small home) environments. IEEE 802.11 WLAN is widely suggested for the last-mile network segment. In this project, a simulation study is done with four major goals in mind: (i) to gather expertise on and evaluate OPNET Modeler 14.5 wireless suite simulation tools for further use, (ii) to gather measurements of two important QoS characteristics of end-to-end delay & jitter in MiWAX backhaul and WLAN last-mile network, (iii) to determine a model specifying which WiMAX scheduling service is best suited for VoIP and Interactive video conferencing for supporting a WiMAX backhaul network, and (iv) to determine any issues impeding QoS performance when traffic traverses the two wireless networks. We concluded from extensive simulation that WiMAX UGS scheduling service is best suited for variable bit rate (VRBR) VoIP traffic and rtPS is the scheduling service of choice for constant bit rate (CBR) video conferencing traffic in the hybrid wireless SOHO network.
