    As known alternative fuels shall undergo two crucial regulations in order to be certified: emission gas rate and the compatibility with engine parts. The objective of this research is to assess the compatibility of engine materials with JetA. The methodology here is in accordance with ASTM D4054; the proposed materials are soaked in proposed fuel. Subsequent to the soak period specimens are subject to specific test standards such as ASTM and visual inspection. Through assessment of compatibility the actual objective is to establish a systematic methodology for future alternative fuel research studies. In another meaning it is aimed to develop in-house capability to create optimum medium for future alternative fuel studies at Ryerson University's Facility for Research on Aerospace Materials and Engineered Structure. Results demonstrate that being wetted at elevated temperatures played a significant role on the physical properties of most non-metallic materials and there is almost no surface deformation observed on metallic materials.
