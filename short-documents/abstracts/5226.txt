This paper investigates the value of deploying municipal wireless network infrastructure. By Vos's (2007c) estimate, there are more than 400 such networks, either deployed or in development in the United States. Many other wireless networks are operational, or being rolled out in cities around the world, including Toronto, London, Bologna, Singapore, Taipei and Perth. Developed by municipal governments, private providers or public-private partnerships, these networks are intended to serve the connectivity needs of local residents, tourists and business travellers.
