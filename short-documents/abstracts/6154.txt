The purpose of this study was to investigate the perspectives and ongoing experiences of a transdisciplinary team responsible for the implementation of an existing policy on the inclusion of children with special needs within a community-based childcare centre. Four factors  were identified as impacting the teamâ€™s ability to effectively implement and sustain the use of the policy over time; 1) understanding about inclusive practices, 2) collaborative team meetings, 3) mutual respect for expertise and 4) resources and supports. The findings assist in developing an understanding of the sustainability of inclusion policies within the context of a specific childcare centre housed in a university campus of a large Canadian metropolis.
