There is currently no standard test method for evaluating the resistance of pervious concrete to salt scaling. In this study, a number of test methods were evaluated to determine an effective test method. A number of parameters were varied, including sample geometry, cycle length, level of submersion, and the effects of various deicers. The optimum cycle length was found to be 24 hours with the submersion of the bottom 10 mm of the pervious concrete samples made with 14 mm aggregate. Cylinder samples with a diameter of 100 mm and height of 150 mm are recommended as they provide consistent results. Using these samples, a mass loss failure criterion of 3 to 5% is proposed. The deicers that caused the most damage are NaCl, CaCl2, and urea, followed by MgCl2, K acetate, Na acetate, and CMA. More testing is needed to validate the effects of different deicers.
