    This thesis project is based on a collection of approximately 3000 World War II photographs, negatives, and supporting artefacts, which were donated to George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film (GEH) in 2007. The material was made and collected by Lieutenant Mark Anthony Freeman (1912-2005), a combat photographer for the US Army Signal Corps. The objectives for this project included organizing the collection and accessioning in into GEH's permanent collection as well as conducting preliminary research into Freeman and the Signal Corps in order to provide future researchers and user of the collection with an understanding of its context and scope. The thesis is divided into two parts, an analytical paper and a finding aid. The analytical paper includes a discussion of the decisions made while organizing, inventorying, accessioning, and re-housing the donation. The finding aid comprises a biography of Mark Anthony Freeman, an overview of the US Army Signal Corps with particular emphasis on the Army Pictorial Service, a map that traces the WWII route Mark Freeman, an inventory of the donation, and an annotated bibliography of relevant resources. The finding aid is conceived as a self-contained document that would be available to researchers in the Study Center at GEH.
