This Major Research Paper explores the value of face-to-face communication in a digital age by examining the effect of face-to-face communication on media coverage. The author outlines the theoretical components of agenda-setting theory, presentation theory, and invitational rhetoric to illustrate the process by which individuals or groups 
compete to gain attention and power, and the role that face-to-face communication can play to persuade. This theory is examined with a political case study of the Liberal Party of Canadaâ€™s cross-Canada bus tour in July and August of 2010. The author provides a discourse analysis of newspaper editorials published in Ontario, Canada before and after then-Party Leader Michael Ignatieff visited. The author observes that the tone of media coverage is more favourable after face-to-face communication with citizens and journalists took place, suggesting that face-to-face communication is an effective tool for politicians in a digital age.
