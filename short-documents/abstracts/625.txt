    This essay summarizes a survey of a group of cartes de visite and cabinet card photographs by one photographer. A history of nineteenth century card photography styles and practices, and a brief biography of photographer J.H. Kent provide context for the objects examined. The study took into consideration 207 photographic objects that were sorted, analyzed, researched, and cataloged. The card mounts were evaluated principally in comparison to William C. Darrah’s book Cartes de Visite in Nineteenth Century Photography in an attempt to ascertain the ease of dating card photographs based on the mounts, imprints and other factors of the overall presentation. The results of the comprehensive assessment and analysis of Kent’s card photographs proved that dating by addresses imprinted on mounts, details in imprint design and typography, and comparisons of imprint designs and card mounts styles to those outlined by Darrah and others is indeed achievable.
