    The objective of this thesis is to determine the influence of a slat arm door on the aerodynamic performance of a wing of a commercial aircraft during it's take off and landing configurations using CFD simulation. The slats are extended forward by extendable arms coming out from the leading edge of the wing after the slat arm is deployed. CFD analysis of wing and slat configuration of the aircraft showed that the removal of this slat door at higher angle of attacks increased the drag by 0.88%, reduced the lift by 1.29%, increased the inert particle residence time inside the slat door compartment by 200.00% and increased the local flow separation area on the top surface of the wing by 42.81% with reference to the closed model.
