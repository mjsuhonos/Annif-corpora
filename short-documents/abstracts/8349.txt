The purpose of CHAP is to assist small to medium workplaces and their Joint Health and Safety Committees to:

1. Better understand the hazards associated with the chemicals/products they
are using; and

2. Prioritize the most ‘hazardous’ chemicals/products for additional assessment
of the effectiveness of control measures which are currently in-place.
