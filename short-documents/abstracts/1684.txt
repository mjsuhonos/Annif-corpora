    This paper describes an applied project relating to a small private collection of fine art photographs created by the little-known American Pictoralist photographer Arthur H. Flint (1864-1943). After suffering years of neglect, the collection was acquired in 2007 by Toronto-based photographer, collector and dealer Steven Evans. Over the course of eight months, I worked with Mr. Evans on the physical and intellectual arrangement of this collection. In addition, I researched the life of Arthur H. Flint and his significance in context to the Pictoralist movement in the USA. This project provides a biography of photographer Arthur H. Flint; an outline of the preservation and collections management process for the Arthur H. Flint photographic collection, and includes a CD containing 234 catalogue records of the Flint collection.
