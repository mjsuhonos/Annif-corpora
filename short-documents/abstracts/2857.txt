The following study investigates the influence of formwork liners on fresh, mechanical and durability properties of cast concretes. In order to investigate the influence of formwork liners (Weather Shield, Poligloss and Zemdrain) manufactured by Newark Group on concrete properties, column and other specimens were cast in conventional moulds (steel, wood and plastic) with and without formwork liners. As per ASTM Standards Surface characteristics, compressive strength, water absorption, sorptivity, chloride penetration, freeze thaw and salt scaling tests were conducted and results are analyzed. It is found that by the application of formwork liners Zemdrain and Weather Shield, compressive strength, water absorption, sorptivity, chloride penetration resistance, freeze thaw resistance and salt scaling resistance were improved. By the application of Poligloss, concrete surface was found to be homogenous without any visible blow-holes.
