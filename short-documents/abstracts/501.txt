    Prefabricated concrete Deck Bulb-Tee (DBT) bridge girder system requires precast girder flanges to be connected and formed bridge deck at site. In this study, a new bridge deck slab flange to flange connection system for precast DBT girders has been investigated. Two types of moment transferring connection and another two types of intermittent bolted connection were developed. A total of four full-scale bridge DBTgirders for the developed connection details were fabricated and then tested to collapse under simulated wheel load. This thesis reports on an experimental study on static behavior and ultimate load carrying capacity of bridge Deck Bulb-Tee girders jointed with proposed connection detail and technology. structural behavior, including stress and strain, crack formation and propagation, deflection, failure mode, and ultimate load capacity, has been identified. Experimental results are compared to those obtained using the Yield-Line Theory and the available Punching Shear Equations.
