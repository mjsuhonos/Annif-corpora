    The public administration literature in support of network governance has grown in the past two decades. Some empirical evidence suggests that if a range of public services are integrated through a network of service providers, a more coordinated seamless service system will be created, reducing fragmentation, gaps, and replication of services, and increasing capacity to plan for and address complex problems with improved client outcomes. There is limited empirical evidence about the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of public service delivery networks. The Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services moved to a network model of service delivery in 2005 to address the needs of citizens with developmental disabilities and mental health/behaviour problems. Using secondary sources and key informant interviews, this research analyzes the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of social service delivery networks by examining Community Networks of Specialized Care in Ontario four years after implementation.
