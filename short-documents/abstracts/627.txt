    In reinforced concrete structures, failure of beam-column joint was observed as one of the major causes of damage of those structures during earthquakes. Non-ductile detailing of reinforcement in the joint in terms of inadequate shear reinforcement in the joint panel or insufficient anchorage of the beam bars within the joint region are the main causes of deficiency in the performance of joints during an earthquake.
    The objectives of this study are to compare different aspects of modeling the nonlinear behavior of exterior beam-column joints and also to propose a new model for the shear behavior of exterior joints. Two well-known computer programs for nonlinear dynamic analysis of the structures DRAIN-2DX (element type 15) and IDARC2D are used. The advantages of using each one for the beam-column joints in the reinforced concrete structures, and the effect of modeling features on the response of beam-column joints are discussed.
