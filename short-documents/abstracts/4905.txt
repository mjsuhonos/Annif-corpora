Despite the fact that their presence in the country has long pre-dated immigration, Indigenous people’s views on immigration policy and the impact immigration continues to have on them is rarely discussed in modern day Canada. In this Major Research Paper, I investigate whether or not Canadian immigration policies of the past and present may be written and enacted in ways that contribute to the marginalization of the country’s Indigenous population. By conducting a literature review of works that examine and critique immigration policies and practises as well as by performing a critical discourse analysis on the Immigration Act of 1910 and the 2002 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act considering critiques of settler colonialism and perspectives on decolonization, I explore the ways that inequality may be reproduced in an institutional level through immigration policy.
