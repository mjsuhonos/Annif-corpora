    The purpose of this study is to compare the deformation of the moving top plate of five distinct parallel plate capacitor designs under applied voltage as well as compare the pull-in voltage of each design.  The parallel plate designs are created using AutoCAD 2008 software and the simulations are performed using CoventorWare 2010.  The control design is first validated with known results and then compared to the remaining four designs.  Finally, pull-in voltages of all five designs is determined and compared to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each design.
