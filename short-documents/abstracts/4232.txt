Two environmental decision making problems are investigated utilizing decision making methods found to be appropriate for each situation. The first study on sustainability alternatives for the aviation industry evaluates possible actions by the industry in order to reduce emissions by utilizing multiple criteria decision making methods. Interdependence of alternatives is considered. In the second study, the graph model for conflict resolution is utilized to investigate the controversy surrounding the recommendations by the International Joint Commission on the fluctuating water levels in the Laurentian Great Lakes. These studies are carried out to clarify and understand the values and considerations that have led to the participantsâ€™ decision making behavior so that insights on creating movement towards desired outcomes are revealed. If the solution is undesirable, the movements on preferences of some participants needed to shift to a better outcome are explored, which add value to the analysis.
