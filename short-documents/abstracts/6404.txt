Canadian nurse leaders have called for academic and practice organizations to address ongoing issues in undergraduate nursing education and the new graduate nurse transition to the nursing role in the practice setting. The purpose of this study was to explore Canadian nurse leadersâ€™ perspectives of the potential value of academic-practice organization partnerships in facilitating a positive transition experience for Canadian new graduate nurses. An exploratory qualitative descriptive approach was employed using semi-structured interviews and conventional content analysis. Nurse leader participants reported value in academic and practice organizations communicating and collaborating to address matters contributing to the new graduate nurse transition to the practice setting. Implications for practice, education, policy and research are explored.
