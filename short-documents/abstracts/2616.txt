In order to affect a more even distribution of immigrants across the country the federal government started a dispersion initiative.  The aim of the diversion initiative was to increase the number of immigrants settling in smaller, second-and third-tier cities since the majority of immigrants settle in the three major metropolises of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.  Given the fact that smaller centre depend on immigration for economic and demographic progress, and the accessing housing presents one of the pillars of broader integration into a society, providing for better housing access in smaller centres thus emanates as an issue requiring resolution as a way to attract and retain immigrants.
