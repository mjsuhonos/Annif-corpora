    The previous research on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inferential sensor (ANFIS) presented an approach to estimate the average indoor temperature and proposed a new method to measure process variables which are impossible to measure directly by using physical sensors in buildings. To achieve high energy efficiency in heating systems, an accurate and robust prediction model is essential. This thesis aims to improve the conventional ANFIS indoor temperature estimator and look for an optimal control of space heating systems. A physical-rule based ANFIS prediction model is proposed. The differences between this physical-rule based ANFIS prediction model and the conventional ANFIS prediction model are presented and analyzed. Three performance  measures (RMSE, RMS, and R2) are used in evaluating the proposed prediction model. The improvement in accuracy and robustness of the physical-rule ANFIS model is presented compared with the conventional ANFIS model. In this thesis, the proposed model is used for designing an adaptive set-point heat exchanger control scheme to improve energy efficiency and indoor comfort. Finally, the food performance of this control scheme is also demonstrated.
