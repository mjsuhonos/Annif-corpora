The adoption of various anti-terror policies by Western governments post-9/11 has
generated discussion on the legitimacy of such counter-terror mechanisms and their
influence on the rights of citizens. This paper aims at establishing a connection between
counter-terrorism, civil liberties and citizenship with the intent of expanding the already
existing literature on citizenâ€™s sentiments towards counter-terrorism measures. While
presenting data from various research studies from Western nation-states, it is my
intention to bring attention to the feelings of racialized citizens as primary targets of the
presented counter-terror tools. I will argue that there is reason to assume that such
counter-terrorism policies presented foster the development of what I refer to as paranoia
for racialized citizens living in Western countries. I will suggest that there is reason to
suspect that these mechanisms advance unintended consequences that may exacerbate
what the initial policies aimed at deterring.
