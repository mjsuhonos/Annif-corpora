Surface runoff source control such as Low Impact Development (LID) techniques are being used as retrofit options for older developed areas that lack available land to implement conventional practices such as stormwater management ponds. The complexity of the catchment area requires detailed distributed urban drainage models, which need high resolution land cover information, to accurately estimate the benefits that LIDs provide. This
thesis explores the use of high resolution WorldView‐2 satellite image in urban drainage modelling. A proposed two‐stage image classification method achieved 83% in image classification accuracy. The classified image was then used to model streets, where the drainage is provided by curb and gutter, roadside ditches and LID. The developed urban drainage models gave comparable but mixed results for different drainage systems compared to the observed runoff data and Geographic Information System (GIS)‐developed models. This research findings provide guidance to modellers in developing detailed distributed urban drainage models.
