    Daylighting design is not just to install large windows and provide maximum daylighting. As a result, uncontrolled daylighting creates over brightness and glare near perimeter zones, increases cooling load in cooling season, increases energy consumption and outweighs the benefits of daylighting. The purpose of daylighting design strategies is to provide controlled daylight with uniform and adequate levels of illuminance in the space. In this paper, problems with daylighting in the Monetary Times Building at Ryerson University have been studied and daylighting design strategies have been evaluated.
    The study results showed that the employed daylighting design strategies in the MON building could be saved up to 135038.4 KWh/year or 61.76 KWh/m2of energy in electrical lighting account. Furthermore, the above daylighting strategy is cost effective; it can be saved up to $14,872.09 per year and the cost for daylighting strategies can be paid-back in up to 15 years.
