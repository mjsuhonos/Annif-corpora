The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of valence and arousal dimensions of music on physiological and subjective recovery from stress, and how these effects might be moderated by trait absorption. In Experiment 1, 40 participants experienced stress after being told to prepare a speech, and then listened to peaceful music or white noise. In Experiment 2, 88 participants experienced stress using the same methodology, and then listened to happy, peaceful, sad or agitated music. Music with a positive valence promoted recovery better than music with a negative valence, and low arousal music was more effective than high arousal music. In both experiments, differences in recovery were largely driven by individuals who were high in absorption.
