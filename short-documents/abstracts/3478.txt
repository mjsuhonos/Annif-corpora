I intend to expand the idea of the immigrants as settler, and establish on a theoretical basis that 'settlerism' is about an ideology of neo-colonialism, not about movement to a place that is not your own. In this way, there can be migrants who are allies with Indigenous peoples, who reject settler and neo-colonial ideologies at the same time, as there can be migrants who adopt consciously, or unconsciously, these oppressive ideologies. After establishing this theoretical framework, the remainder of this MRP presents case studies which profile some of the important work being done by organizations to build bridges between Indigenous and migrant communities in Canada and to decolonize relations among these groups which make up much of Canada's population. A brief discussion about the policies and other stat tools used to separate these two communities with an analysis of why this is the case will also be included.
