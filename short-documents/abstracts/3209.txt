"This paper is an effort to synthesize and analyze the issues and the players that inhabit Canadian content and Cancon's relationship to Canadian broadcasting and economics. Granted, such a survey could be an epic undertaking that would not fit the parameters of this paper. However, the intention is that this document will be a comprehensive study of the topic in its current context. Little attention will be paid to Cancon's historical roots or the specific factors or people/organizations that have moulded Cancon into its current version. A task of such nature goes beyond the scope of this paper"--From the Introduction page 5.
