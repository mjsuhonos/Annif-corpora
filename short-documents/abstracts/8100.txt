This major research project (MRP) works to develop a photography application called Glopal that creates an experience for children to develop an unbiased, empathetic viewpoint of the world.                                                                                         My goal is to help children develop their own, “voice, creativity, agency, and new forms of literacy in a media-saturated era,” while creating firsthand experiences of other cultures (Lange & Ito, 2010, p. 247).  Their view of the world is based off of content that is rooted from colonial thinking, which is often biased and stereotypical. Further, by taking their own photographs, children are able to establish their own perspective of the world and foster their intrapersonal dialogue. Children are removed from the “performance” space of social networking sites and can show their true selves through the Glopal app. This essay shows how the Glopal app can be a new digital tool in the development of a child’s global citizenship.
