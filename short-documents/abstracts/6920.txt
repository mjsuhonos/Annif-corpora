Public Space is a photographic and video project examining the relationship
between the public sphere and private corporations. The project explores
various sites throughout Toronto and New York that are on private property but
have been built with the intention of allowing the general public to have
unrestricted access to these areas. These spaces are referred to as Privately
Owned Public Space or “POPS”.

The goal of the project is to question and document, through photographic and
video practice, these spaces within the urban environment and to challenge
others to consider whether these spaces are effective in achieving their intended
use and if they are truly accessible to the general public. Loss of the public
space is an ongoing issue that faces cities and developers often receive
concessions to bylaw zoning requirements in exchange for incorporating POPS.
This thesis project is a personal exploration of how these spaces are changing
the urban environments of North American cities in the twenty first century.
