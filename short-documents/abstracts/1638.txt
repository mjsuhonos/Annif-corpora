    This paper examines the effectiveness of two pretreatments on Source-Separated Organic waste (SSO) mixed with wood wastes: long term lime for SSO mixed with forestry waste (hardwoods), and the cellulose solvent-organic lignocellulose fractionation (COSLIF) method, with SSO and demolition waste (softwoods).  For long term lime treatment, the highest overall conversions from cellulose to glucose and xylose were 50.4%, and 43.5% respectively.  The best temperature found for long term lime pretreatment was 65째C.  The COSLIF pretreatment glucose yield was found to be 93.7%.  The highest enzyme hydrolysis yield found was 93.5% for a cellulase loading of 30 FPU/g glucan at 50째C.  The best hydrolysis yield found at lower loading (10 FPT/g glucan), was 83.5%.  At 40 and 50째C, all peak hydrolysis yields  were achieved between 12 and 24 hours.  A drop in temperature below 40째C caused a slowing of the hydrolysis rate.
