With the rapid growth of workplaces, there is also an increase of the risk employees are exposed to. A high percentage of the injuries suffered annually are work related and many of those are due to the decrease in alertness of employees as they get tired. As a result, many of the injuries are fall related, touching a hot object etc. Therefore, safety in the workplace can be increased if employees can be monitored continuously and warning them when they come close to a restricted (hazardous) area.
The current paper presents an in-depth analysis of existing approaches to 3D object tracking which can be deployed to monitor workers and try to prevent injury. The final goal is to design, implement and test an SoC capable of performing real time object tracking in 3D which can send the coordinates to a standalone computer to be displayed and processed.
