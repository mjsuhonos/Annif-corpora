    A three-dimensional numerical simulation was conducted to study the effect of a rotating magnetic (RMF) field on the fluid flow, heat transfer and mass transfer in the presence of various gravity levels by utilizing the traveling solvent method (TSM). The presence of the RMF suppressed the buoyancy convection in the GE₀.₉₈ Si₀.₀₂ solution zone in order to get homogeneity with a flat growth interface. It was found that the intensity of the flow at the centre of the crucible decreased at a faster rate compared to the flow near the walls when increasing magnetic field intensity is combined with a certain rotational speed. This behavior created a stable and uniform silicon distribution in the horizontal plane near the growth interface in the terrestrial condition. Different magnetic field intensities for different rotational speeds were examined in both terrestrial and micro-gravity conditions. The effects of residual acceleration, known as G-jitter, on board the International Space Station and European Space Orbiter were also investigated.
