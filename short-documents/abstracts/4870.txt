In 2024, all commercial operations at the Pickering Nuclear Generation Station cease and the station will begin its decommissioning process. Ontario Power Generation is currently looking developing a repurposing strategy for the site throughout the decommissioning process, which is expected to be complete by 2064. This project presents a unique opportunity to re-imagine the future of this site, while setting a precedent for the reuse of nuclear sites and facilities once they have reached the end of their life cycle â€“ an issue that will be more prevalent in the coming years. This project proposes a vision for the site to be transformed into parkland using ecological restoration practices, and establishing a Centre for Clean Energy Technology. Using design as a form of research, the project was informed by background research that included a review of existing literature on post-industrial site redevelopment, precedent studies, and site reconnaissance.
