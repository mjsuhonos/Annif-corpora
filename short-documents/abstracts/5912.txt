Conducted by an HIV+ activist-researcher, the study reported upon in this MRP aimed to 1) explore the challenges and opportunities faced by a new movement led by Canadians living with HIV to place the affected community of people living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) back to the forefront of the national HIV response; and 2) establish the key factors and conditions that may help strengthen this community-led effort. The qualitative study utilized the Positive People Centred Perspective as theoretical framework comprised of interviews with key Canadian HIV+ activists on their reflections of the recent efforts by the new Canadian Positive People Network (CPPN) to create a collective voice for Canadian PHAs and their views of the essential elements that are necessary for the network and movement to thrive. Results of the research will help strengthen the development of CPPN and inform critical, anti-oppressive social work practice and scholarship.
