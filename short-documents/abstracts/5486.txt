This study incorporated embroidery with autobiographical memory to create a wearable story line that draws pictures of the life experience across different ages. The study drew from 5 participants’ precious memories as an inspiration to create a line of necklaces representing key points in participants’ lived experiences, thereby transforming the memories into tangible items that can be held, touched, and worn. Lesage couture embroidery and 3D printing were incorporated to interpret the memories. The final designs were shown to participants to observe their interaction and collect their verbal and non-verbal feedback.
