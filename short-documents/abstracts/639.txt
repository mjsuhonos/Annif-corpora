    This project attempts to explain the deportation process in Canada. Specifically I highlight how the deportation decision making process is not only about removing a person from the country but also creating a desirable citizenry. The inclusion of Chan's article as a case study was important to this project as no other study has included statistics based on country of origin, Immigration Appeal Division members' comments or reasoning for decisions made at deportation appeal hearings. Comments reveal differential perceptions of immigrants from Anglo-European countries and non-white countries on rehabilitation and re-offending. Statistics are provided and the tendency for appellants from non-white countries to have their deportation appeal hearing dismissed happen more often than those from Anglo-European countries. I will highlight how removing someone from the country and making 'good' citizens is rooted in racialized concepts of nationhood and what it means to be an 'ideal' citizen.
