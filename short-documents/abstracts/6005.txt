This research was motivated by an interest in understanding how social media are applied in teaching in higher education. Data were collected using an online questionnaire, completed by 333 instructors in higher education, that asked about general social media use and specific use in teaching. Education and learning theories suggest three potential reasons for instructors to use social media in their teaching: (1) exposing students  to  practices,  (2)  extending  the  range  of  the  learning  environment,  and  (3)  promoting  learning through  social  interaction  and  collaboration.  Answers  to  open-ended  questions  about  how  social  media were used in teaching, and results of a factor analysis of coded results, revealed six distinct factors that align  with  these  reasons  for  use:  (1)  facilitating student  engagement, (2)  instructorâ€™s organization for teaching, (3) engagement with outside resources, (4) enhancing student attention to content, (5) building communities of practice, and (6) resource discovery. These factors accord with a Uses and Gratifications perspective that depicts adopters as active media users choosing and shaping media use to meet their own needs.  Results provide  a  more comprehensive picture of social media use than found  in  previous  work, encompassing not only the array of media used but also the range of purposes associated with use of social media in contemporary teaching initiatives.
