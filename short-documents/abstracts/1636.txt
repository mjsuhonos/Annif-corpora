    The Canadian Ice Service (CIS) has made available online access to some collections of its ice service archive. Currently, most of these historical ice information services are organized by a sort of static map images and web pages. Users can only view static result images of sea ice analyses or download raw sea ice data from the site. However, it is difficult for users to generate customized analyses without sophisticated information technology (IT). This thesis focuses on a sea ice information system (SIIS) designed specifically to improve the current CIS website with a possible method in developing web-based sea ice GIS system. The main achievements of the thesis are: (1) it accomplishes an SIIS design based on the popular web application principle known as Rich Internet Application (RIA); (2) it applies many current technologies around RIA and GIS to improve system quality; and (3) a prototype system is also developed to demonstrate how GIS may help in improving GIS-based online ice information services.
