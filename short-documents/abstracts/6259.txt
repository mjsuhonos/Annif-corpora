This paper seeks to explore the evolution of social housing policy in Toronto as well as provide insight into new "revitalization" initiatives. After identifying key trends in social housing, it compares these insights with the opinions expressed in interviews with key informants in Toronto's housing sector. The implications of this research reveal several important findings. First, in regard to the supply of social housing, it is clear that Toronto is in the midst of a housing crisis. Secondly, despite significant research that casts doubts on the proposed benefits of new "revitalization" schemes, key informants in the sector appear to have accepted the current agenda of the social housing sector. The entrenchment of such opinions, it is argued, marks a clear change from past priorities in social housing and also contributes to the overshadowing of the dismantling of the social housing sector at a time when it is most needed.
