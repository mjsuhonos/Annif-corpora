Millennial generation travellers have different behaviors towards advertisements. The purpose of this project is to focus on answering the thesis question: do image-based advertisements including human figure gain more attraction than image-based advertisements that includes graphical, colorful content? For this research, we will create a startup focused on serving millennial travellers. Then, we will conduct a comparison between classic, combined, and graphic advertising styles, using differently created images. The goal of this comparative study is to understand the most effective advertising strategy for a startup geared toward millennial travellers. We tested these advertising strategies on millennial travellers visiting Toronto or currently living in Toronto. Our hypothesis was that millennial travellers will be more interested in an image-based advertisement including humans or human face within travel and tourism advertisements. The results showed that millennial travellers are more interested in an image-based advertisement including humans or human face.
