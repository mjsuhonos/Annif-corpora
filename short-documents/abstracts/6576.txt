The purpose of this qualitative study was to gain a snapshot of the unregulated home-based care sector (UHBC). All seven participants in this study were Caucasian females providing unregulated childcare on a full-time basis within their homes. Data collection took place in the form of semi-structured interviews. The UHBC providers’ perceptions about their work were examined through the theoretical lens of the political economy of care that encompasses features such as social reproduction, grey market economy, transnationalization of care, and solutions that address political economy of care. The analysis revealed that the unregulated services UHBC providers offer embody a political economy of care. However, in addressing a political economy of care, the UHBC providers believe that they are meeting families’ needs, and wish for a better regulation of UHBC. A possible system of UHBC regulation is proposed.
