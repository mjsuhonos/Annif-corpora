    The high pH (~10) and elevated concentration of metals and oxyanions such as As, Fe, Ni, Mo and Se in the Deilmann tailings management facility (DTMF) presents a highly selective environment for microorganisms. The objective of this study was to assess the potential for metal and ion solubilization by the indigenous mixed microbial community in both optimum (high carbon) and (low carbon alkaline environment) conditions in terms of bulk pH and redox potential in order to satisfy the requirement for calculating long term stability. A flow-cell system was developed in order to monitor the extent of microbial metal reduction as well as determine biofilm formation by tailings-isolated mixed communities. The microbial consortium isolated from the DTMF has shown the ability to reduce ferric iron for energy conservation under both carbon conditions.
