The sub-pixel peak position estimation performance of the Linear Phase algorithm was enhanced and extended for use with a two-dimensional sensor. The two-dimensional system is composed of orthogonal pairs of slits diffracting light onto a single pixel array. The adaptation of the Linear Phase algorithm into the two-dimensional system was performed by manipulating the sensor image into two one-dimensional images. Performance testing used simulated sensor output and images attained from a real sun-sensor. The Linear Phase algorithm was then implemented into an embedded system to simulate onboard processing. A C8051 microcontroller was used as the embedded microcontroller. Results from the embedded processing were compared against the native Matlab implementation for consistency in sub-pixel peak position estimation performance. The Linear Phase algorithm was able to perform with excellent results, comparable to current two-dimensional sun-sensor algorithms.
