Performance of the residential waste management practices in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) was studied.  The study encompassed identification of waste management practices and analysis of data concerning different management options followed by the Regional Municipalities of Durham, Halton, Peel, York and the City of Toronto during 2002 to 2008. Historically, wastes from the GTA were disposed of in the landfills.  Majority wastes [sic] from the GTA were exported to Michigan under a contract which is going to be expired [sic] at the end of 2010.  Residents already [sic] opposed to accept new landfills.  Toxic emissions from the incinerators are also of great concern to them.  Integrated waste management system comprising source reduction, recycling and reuse, diversion through green bin SSO program and the aerobic/anaerobic processing of organic waste treatment can be considered to succeed in achieving the most effective and sustainable solution to the residential waste management problems in the GTA.
