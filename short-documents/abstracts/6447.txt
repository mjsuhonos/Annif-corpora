High-tech incubators offer their entrepreneurs mentoring services to help them achieve goals
faster. In a successful mentoring relationship protégées learn from the statements, actions,
questions, and communication styles of their mentors. Mentors can play an important role in
developing their protégées’ social competencies, which allow them to increase their social
capital. This research tests a predictive model for the contribution of mentors to the development
of their protégées’ social competencies in a high-tech incubation environment. The predictor
variables of the model are the active communication-time between mentors and their protégée entrepreneurs,
and the age of a mentoring relationship, referred to as elapse-time. The outcome
variable is the development of social competencies of protégée-entrepreneurs. Moreover, the
levels of trust from protégée-entrepreneurs towards their mentors might moderate this time social
competency relationship.

The social competencies of individuals involve six elements: emotional expressivity, emotional
sensitivity, emotional control, social expressivity, social sensitivity, and social control. The
Social Skills Inventory (SSI), an established psychometric scale that captures all six dimensions
of social competencies, is used to test this model. After the participation of 99 protégées entrepreneurs
from 10 incubators at Ryerson University, a new seven-item trust scale has been
validated; however, the roles of elapse-time and communication-time in developing the social
competencies of protégée-entrepreneurs are not supported. Surprisingly, after the verification of
the SSI, it turned out that it is not valid to the participating sample set. In conclusion, despite the
claimed generalizability of the SSI, it is now questionable, and the creation of a social
competency scale for incubated entrepreneurs is an opportunity for future research.
