Wind farm development strategies are compared with respect to gaining public acceptance between Ontario and Germany. Public opposition to wind farm development is currently experienced in Ontario and strategies employed by Germany to mitigate public opposition and gain public acceptance have been proven to be effective. These two jurisdictions are comparable due to similar jurisdictional responsibility for renewable energy development and implementation of climate change goals. Historical factors have been shown to trigger wind farm development for Ontario and Germany but certain historical events have played a larger impact to public acceptance in Germany. Germany has been able to maintain and increase the level of public acceptance to wind farm development by utilizing inclusive planning legislation and encouraging community based incentives. Ontario has developed legislation to increase wind farm development but has increased wind farm opposition. Ontario could increase public acceptance to wind farm development by learning from Germanyâ€™s experiences.
