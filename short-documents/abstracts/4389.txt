The following paper explores the digital media market from an accessibility point of view; what does digital accessibility look like today? What further efforts are needed to ensure digital media products and services are in compliance with universal design practices? The paper will be supplemented by both academic research, as well as ethnographic accounts of the authorâ€™s experiences whilst working on AccessNow, a web service aimed at lifting mobility barriers. Topics explored include the disenfranchisement of people with disabilities in consumerist society, the dichotomy of the medical and social models, as well as a brief overview of universal web design, accessible gaming, and existing assistive technologies. Findings show there has been significant progress towards the incorporation of accessibility design guidelines, however, the process is slow and adopted by few. There is a significant gap in the accessible digital media market, which may be an enticing opportunity for economic investment.
