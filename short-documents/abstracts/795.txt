    This thesis presents research that creates a mobile solution to monitor human brain functions during real-life activities. The solution utilizes the Internet, the Global Standard for Mobile Communication (GSM) wireless networks, Bluetooth technology, and a number of data protocols. It consists of three main parts: 1. a Bluetooth portable near-infratred light sensor, 2. a personal digital assistant (PDA), and 3. a personal computer (PC). The near real time data acquisition is performed by the sensor while mobility is provided by the GSM PDA. The data is sent over a multi-protocol stack until it reaches the final destination PC. The system provides a light-weight, tissue hemoglobin monitoring system for real-life situations not restricted to a lab.
