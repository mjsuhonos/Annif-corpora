This project explores some of the ways interactive technology has been used in education to increase student engagement, and suggests how novel rendering and interaction technologies can be used in learning environments to increase student engagement. With the utilization of the Unity game engine, Near Field Communication using an Arduino, and Vuforia image recognition software, a 3D platform was created for a technology called the Looking Glass, which adapts 3D models to appear as 3D holograms. The idea behind the platform was to suggest ways in which technology can be used to create more engaging content in an educational setting, in order to combat the constant struggle many students have with diverting their attention away from their distracting smartphones. In the end, the goal is to suggest that in battle against distractions in a classroom, engaging content prevails over technology confiscation.
