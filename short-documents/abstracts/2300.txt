Retrofitting Canada’s existing housing stock to increase energy efficiency of dwellings is
an opportunity to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Gemini
Nested Thermal Envelope Design (NTED®) is an innovative building retrofit that
drastically reduces energy consumption. However, this innovation’s potential can only
be realized once it has achieved widespread market acceptance.
Using Gemini NTED® as a case study, an innovation commercialization model was
applied to energy retrofits to aid in establishing an appropriate commercialization strategy
for Toronto. Market research conducted within this study identified external factors
affecting commercialization, barriers to innovation adoption and competitive forces
affecting profitability. Economic valuation evaluated discounted monetary savings from
reduced energy consumption. Results show that the retrofit market is moderately
attractive and conducive to earning profits. Results related to Gemini NTED® show that
Gemini may have commercialization potential for retrofitting older electrically heated
homes especially in Canadian provinces with high electricity rates. Results arising from
a soon to be completed Gemini NTED® pilot will confirm capital costs and economic
benefit.
