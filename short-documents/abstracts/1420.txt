    This thesis project discusses the British Press Agencies Collection ("BPAC") which was donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario ("AGO") in 2008 by the Archive of Modern Conflict in London, England.  The BPAC, a collection of 1240 gelatin silver prints includes works from over 50 press agencies and 70 photographers.
    Completion of this thesis project involved researching the images in the BPAC, organizing and re-housing the collection and creating a finding aid.
    This thesis project has three parts: 1)an analytical paper, 2)the organization and re-housing of the collection, and 3)the creation of a finding aid.
    The analytical paper discusses the methodology of the research undertaken, the choices made in the organization and re-housing of the collection, and the issues surrounding large press collections in museums.  The finding aid is intended to be a document available to researchers in the Marvin Gelber Prints and Drawing Study Centre at the AGO.
