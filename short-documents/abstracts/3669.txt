Advances in design are transforming the means and methods of production and assembly by impacting how we approach a project from conception. Pushing the industry to rethink how we perceive design and explore working digitally. 

Contemporary architectural thinking is heavily influenced by the digital workspace and the overall expression. Through modularization, this thesis has approached design from a small scale perspective to consider the design potentials in details, structure, and processes of construction by incorporating manufacturing and assembly into design from conception to gain a closer relationship between architecture and construction. This is done through the intimate knowledge of assembly and its production, which will then inform modular design, and relate to its method in modular construction. Designing with manufacturing and assembly in mind, means every process will demand a design environment that cannot remain in abstract or neutral states.

This strategy has enabled systems of design, manufacturing and assembly to become a new integrated hybrid for creative design which allows the architect to maintain focus over the digital to physical transition and embrace design intent. The stress on design development and the application of small scale detailed design decisions from conception are necessary in order to achieve accuracy and precision during the digital to physical transition that will assist in the constructability of the design.

This will be shown through devising solutions in modular design and construction to an existing buildings, project parameters. In this regard, there are a number of benefits that can be applied to current and future issues of construction and design which has opened a new window for fresh context where architects may re‚Äêengage with the broader culture to benefit society.
