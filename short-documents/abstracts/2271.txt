    This study examines the experiences of CCAC Care Coordinators when assessing, allocating, and managing medically complex children who require home and community care services. A case-study design was implemented, employing a focus group with seven Care Coordinators and an analysis of the 14 Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) Integrated Health Service Plans (IHSPs) across Ontario. Three major findings arose from the study. First, families are experiencing increased levels of burden related to the child's care responsibilities. Second, there remains a health human resource shortage of individuals with a specialization in paediatrics in the home and community sector. Third, Care Coordinators function as street-level bureaucrats when allocating publicly funded services without the use of a standardized assessment tool. Ultimately, a model of care needs to be implemented supporting a balanced approach to assessment, utilizing standard assessment tools while providing a means for Care Coordinators to utilize their expertise in allocating services.
