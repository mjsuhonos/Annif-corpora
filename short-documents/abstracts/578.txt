    This is a study that in a preliminary way explores the boundaries of immigration as a field of study. It does so at two scales - the national and the local - by examining a sample of articles published in the Journal of International Migration and Integration and Michael Doucet's Bibliography on Immigration and Settlement in the Toronto Area, Third Edition. The implications of findings are then discussed in the light of concepts such as multidisciplinarity, authorship and knowledge production.
