    The Canadian Architect Image Archive (1955-1990) was donated to Ryerson University Library's Special Collections in March 2009. Over the course of a year, the archive was catalogued and properly housed. This applied thesis project describes the process of subject indexing a photograph collection in order to provide easy user access and preservation of the archive. The two groups of photographs chosen as case studies are 'Toronto' and 'Quebec', and are the most commonly requested to use for research. This thesis provides a discussion of the context and methodology of subject indexing a unique photographic archive. The thesis contains an appendix with the two subject indexes, proposed subject index testing questionnaire, and an accompanying CD with the indexes in their full format.
