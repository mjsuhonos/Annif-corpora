This study explores the lived experiences of internationally educated, Filipino social work professionals during their integration into the Canadian labour force. The need to pursue this topic stemmed from the recognition of the barriers faced by internationally educated Social Work professionals as they embark on a social work career in Canada. This phenomenological, qualitative research utilized one-on-one in-depth interviews with four Filipino social work
professionals who obtained education and professional experience in the Philippines. Participants have all resided within Canada for five to ten years, have had their credentials assessed, and have been registered with Ontarioâ€™s regulatory body. As an insider of this particular group, the researcher aims to identify the challenges they encounter to pursuing a Canadian social work career, which are limited by systemic barriers; a lack of connections; personal barriers; and a lack of knowledge regarding Canadian legislation and the social welfare system.
