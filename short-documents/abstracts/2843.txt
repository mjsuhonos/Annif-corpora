Settlement services for newcomers in Canada have been traditionally funded at a federal level with providers at a community level, often referred to as immigrant service providers (ISPs). But settlement provision does not stop at ISPs. A new player has joined the immigrant settlement service sector in Canada: “The Private Sector”, which includes employers and universities. This shift in provision is particularly a reality for newcomers who have arrived via the provincially downloaded Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). This research aims to examine the contemporary practices of settlement services of immigrants who have arrived via the PNP, and offers an examination of multilevel governance, best practices, challenges, recommendations and the neoliberal shift in
newcomer settlement provision.
