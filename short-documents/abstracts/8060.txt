Whoever said 'creating a startup is easy' clearly wasn't thinking straight. The term 'startup' in itself explains that you're starting something new. You - as the owner of your business are responsible for every move and every decision. The preliminary stages are the most crucial for startups and therefore, a marketing plan and use of storytelling must be compelling for customers and investors. The purpose of this project is to share my experiences throughout the process, providing an overview of my marketing strategy and discussing how I overcame the challenges I faced. I will also be touching on the "why" factor. Why did I decide ecommerce was the path I wanted to embark on? Additionally, I'll share how the MDM program influenced my decisions, the importance of social media for my business, and my future plans.
