This phenomenological study explores LGBTQ parentsâ€™ experiences in seeking and in being part of early years environments, such as family support programs and childcare services, in Toronto, Ontario. Literature has shown that heteronormativity plays a significant role in early years environments, thereby, silencing other sexualities. This silencing of sexual minorities adds an additional layer to the process of seeking an early years environment, which involves assessing LGBTQ inclusion of such environments. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted
with LGBTQ parents to compare their experiences to the literature, and to consider implications for future practice and policy. The sample was found to have generally positive experiences.  Collaboration was an important factor in creating more positive experiences for parents. Future research should consider further inclusion of bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals in order to continue to better understand their experiences in early years environments and build upon the knowledge gained here.
