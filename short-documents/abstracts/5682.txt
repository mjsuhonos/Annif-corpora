Food is a highly useful tool to better understand the process of immigration and acculturation and it speaks to deeper symbolic meanings of social realities, especially in the lives of immigrants. As such, this paper explores the deeper symbolic meaning behind food purchasing, preparation, and consumption (PPC) habits within the Latin American community who have settled in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area. Here I argue that food PPC is a highly gendered experience and is reflective of the integration and acculturation process as a whole within the Canadian context. Food cannot be separated from its deeper symbolic meaning and within the field of immigration, food can and ought to be used as a lense of analysis.
