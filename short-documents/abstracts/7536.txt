A statistical analysis is conducted in this study on the shear strength parameters of fine-grained tills from a series of consolidated undrained triaxial tests performed for a light rail transit project in the City of Toronto. Three different failure criteria are applied: the maximum stress ratio, the maximum deviator stress, and the residual stress. Three methods generate only minimal difference in the shear failure angle and a slight difference in cohesion. The friction angle calculated using the maximum stress ratio method ranges from 18.6 to 35.26 degrees compared with values ranging from 18.5 to 34.26 degrees by the maximum deviator stress method. The undrained shear modulus calculated from one-third and two-third peak deviator stress points generate a wide variation from 2 MPa to 167 MPa with an average value of 34 MPa.
