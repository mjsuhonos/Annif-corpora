Deindustrialization and rapid population growth in the City of Toronto has resulted in greater employment land conversion pressures being placed on underutilized and vacant Employment Areas (Blais, 2015; Filon 2003). In 2013, City Planning Staff made recommendations to City Council for the preservation or conversion of specific employment land application requests under the City of Toronto’s Municipal Comprehensive Review process (City of Toronto, 2013). This paper will examine five employment land conversion applications in Toronto’s inner suburbs, the Scarborough Urban Growth Centre and within 500 meters of the Mimico GO Station through a content analysis of City Planning Staff’s recommendations along with the property owner’s rationales. It was found that the five sites should be converted to better meet the Provincial and Municipal planning policy requirements that align with Smart Growth’s objectives. The five sites pose minimal land use compatibility conflicts, require increases in population and employment density, and are isolated from larger Employment Areas.
