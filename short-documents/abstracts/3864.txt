This paper provides an overview of biom*, an umbrella term for biomimicry, biomimetics, bio-inspired design and related fields. The paper explores three levels of biom* bridging, discusses benefits and implications of adopting a systems perspective, and proposes initiatives for further development. Searching for ‘sweet spots’ leveraging the synergy between aspiration, our growing knowledge of natural systems, and the market economy will improve the ability of biom* to deliver meaningful and impactful solutions.
