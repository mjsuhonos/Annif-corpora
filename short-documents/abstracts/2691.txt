The Emergency Department is often the main portal of entry for acutely ill elderly patients with dementia requiring healthcare. Emergency nurses assume responsibility for managing both critical illnesses and Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia. Using narrative methodology and photographic images provided by participants, two emergency department nurses were interviewed to understand their experiences caring for patients with dementia. A Critical Social Theory lens facilitated an examination of how dominant discourse about work environment, power relations, and the healthcare system shape their stories of dementia. Findings indicated that nurses’ experiences are shaped by frustrations, threaten person-centred care, and are associated with limited time and knowledge and competing work demands when caring for patients with dementia. Study recommendations include the need for policy that supports culture change in the emergency department, investment in professional development of emergency department nurses, and infrastructure supports such as Geriatric Emergency Management nurses and nurse’s aides
