Merchant-owned charging stations will replace gasoline stations in the near future. As charging times of electric vehicles (EV) may be significant, without optimization, customers will wait to get charged without knowing the actual period of charging. In this thesis, two optimal scheduling methods for charging electric vehicles were developed for merchant-owned charging facilities, the first with a single charger and the second with multiple chargers.

In the mathematical model for the single merchant-owned charging station, the problem is formulated as a hybrid nonlinear optimization model and solved using a backward recursive algorithm with nonlinear optimization solvers. As for a single charger, a hybrid system framework was used to capture the tradeoff between demand charges and speed of charging.

For the merchant-owned multiple chargers case, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear optimization challenge with three-dimensional matrices characterizing the solution space and was solved using the MOSEK optimization toolbox in MATLAB.

The proposed algorithms have been analyzed for different penalty factors which were imposed on total waiting time of each EV. Final results are analyzed and discussed.
