    With Canada becoming more accessible due to travel, the number of separated minors fleeing to Ontario is increasing. Under provincial legislation Child and Family Services Act, Ontario’s child protection system unfortunately only has an age of protection up to 16 years. Consequently any separated minor arriving in Ontario who is 16 or 17 years old is left unprotected and alone. This paper will explore the settlement experiences of these specific separated minors through two perspectives. The opinions and criticisms of associates who work with Ontario’s protection system and with separated minors will be explored, as well as the lived experiences of separated minors settling in Ontario will be examined. Ultimately this paper will highlight the importance of protection for all minors up to the age of 18.
