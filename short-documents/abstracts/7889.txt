This thesis is a year-long inquiry on the Canadian North using the practice-based research
method a/r/tography. This a/r/tographic research on the Canadian North follows the method's three
modalities: theoria, praxis, and poesis. It concludes by presenting the North as a non-place, placeless, a
pseudo-place. Ultimately, this thesis contributes to a/r/tography's ongoing development as a research
methodology. I propose to expand the frames within which we conceptualize a/r/tography's theoria,
praxis, and poesis. The re-defining and re-organization of these three modalities opens a/r/tography to a
wider range of creators to allow for even more boundary-breaking work. In addition, I draw out the
possibilities of Lures as a hitherto unrecognized seventh conceptual practice embedded in a/r/tography.
Moreover, I describe a/r/tographers as child-voyagers who are able to momentarily dispense with their
perceptual frameworks and enter spaces that allow them to see the world anew. Most importantly, I reconceptualize a/r/tography as a method of awe.
