Utilizing Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), this study examines the representation of live-in caregivers (LC) and the Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP), between 2007 and 2013, in eleven mainstream Canadian newspapers (N=32) and five Filipino-Canadian newspapers (N=31).  It contributes to the extant media analyses on the LCP by including the perspective of the ethnic press, and, thus, the voices of LC, LC advocates, and members of the Filipino community.  It also examines the recent hype surrounding the emergence of au pairing as a suitable caregiving option for Canadian families in light of the declining number of LC following the April 1, 2010 reforms to the LCP.  This study concludes that the mainstream Canadian press portrayal of LC and their children is congruous with the "Problem Approach," while that in the ethnic newspapers is congruous with the "Agency Approach," providing a space to both empower LC and resist negative mainstream portrayals.
