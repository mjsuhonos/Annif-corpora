This systematic literature review examined the current research on mindfulness for the well being of children and adolescents with health-related challenges, for the purpose of identifying best practices. Rigorous methods were applied to select evidence published in the past 10 years, resulting in 19 studies eligible for inclusion in the review. These studies were then presented, organized by the children’s different diagnoses, in order to provide a critical overview of the current evidence. Prominent themes in the literature were reviewed, including adaptations to
mindfulness programs for use with children, scales employed to measure mindfulness, and gaps in research. Implications for practice were presented, such as the importance of including caregivers in children’s interventions, the need to incorporate play and games, and the necessity that interventions be delivered by individuals experienced in mindfulness meditation.
