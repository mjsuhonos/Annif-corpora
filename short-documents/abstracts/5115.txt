In this paper, we demonstrate a new method of fabricating silicon microfluidic channels filled with a porous nanofibrous structure utilizing a femtosecond laser. The nanofibrous structure can act as a membrane used for microfiltration. This method allows us to generate both the microfluidic channel and the fibrous nanostructure in a single step under ambient conditions. Due to laser irradiation, a large number of nanoparticles ablate from the channel surface, and then aggregate and grow into porous nanofibrous structures and fill the channels. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was conducted to examine the oxygen concentration in the membrane structure. Our results demonstrated that by controlling the laser parameters including pulse repetition, pulse width and scanning speed, different microfluidic channels with a variety of porosity could be obtained.
