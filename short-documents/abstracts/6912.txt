Newcomer youth arrive to Canada with multiple social identities including, their immigration pathway, status, race, gender, sexuality etc. which shapes their individual experiences and settlement. The term “intersectionality” was coined by Crenshaw (1991) to highlight how identities intersect and can act as sites of cross-roads of oppression, as rooted in an understanding of social exclusion and inclusion. This paper studies how newcomer youth programs in Toronto are informed by intersectionality. Audio interviews were conducted with three service providers to study their cognizance of intersectionality, their experiences with newcomer youth who have multiple identities, and if/how their programs incorporate an intersectional lens. Results showed that while key informants practice and understand intersectionality, they feel limited by funding and other barriers which stifle their inclusivity. The potential benefits of this project exist for service providers and their workplaces, who can evaluate their understanding of newcomer youth to recognize and support them better.

Key words: intersectionality; newcomer youth; Toronto
