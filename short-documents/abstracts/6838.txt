The purpose of this study was to investigate factors contributing to sediment accumulation rates in Stormwater Management ponds. For the purpose of this study almost fifty municipalities in Ontario were contacted and in collaboration with five of those municipalities this study was conducted. A questionnaire was developed and sent to municipalities through email and followup with in-person meetings were conducted. After collecting data and analyzing various characteristics of sediment accumulation rates in SWM ponds, a database was developed to systematically record the relevant information. Additional information on pond properties and drainage areas was sought through a questionnaire and meeting with stormwater managers, and supplemented with historic information. Data collected and used in the study was anonymized in all resulting publications. The calculated accumulated rates from the provided data were compared against the values extracted from the literature review. The developed approach will serve in the
development of data-driven modelling approach in SWM ponds.
