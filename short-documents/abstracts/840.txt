    A series of flexural test and creep tests were conducted on 53 OSB structural insulated sandwich timber panels to predict their behavior when subjected to gravity loading when used in residential and low rise nonresidential buildings. The experiments were designed and performed to test full-scale panels for roof and floor residential construction. The structural adequacy of the developed sandwich panel system is investigated with respect to the effectiveness of the foam core in providing composite action required to meet both strength and serviceability limit-state design reruirements per Canadian Standards for timber design. Strength requirements included flexure and shear, while serviceability check included limiting deflection under operating conditions as well as creep performance under sustained loading. Results from experimental testing were used to draw conclusions with respect the structural qualifications for these SIPs to be "as good as" the structural capacity of conventional wood-frame buildings
