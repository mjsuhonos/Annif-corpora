The co-ordination chemistry and resulting catalytic potential of Group 9 and 11 transition metal centered complexes with the 2-acylmethyl-2-oxazoline skeleton are detailed. Each of the synthesized ligand species were treated with either a Copper (II) or Cobalt (II) salt to promote co-ordination, in all cases deprotonation of the ligand occurred. These complexes have, thereafter, been examined by infrared spectroscopy (IR), UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), mass spectrometry (MS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), combustion analysis (EA) and x-ray diffraction and probed for their potential redox properties. In the case of Cu(II) chelated complexes, no desirable redox behaviour was observed. Although, with respect to Co(II) complexes, one complex displayed favourable redox potential. The redox active species have been shown to effectively catalyze the polymerization of methyl methacrylate with tosyl chloride as an initiator, through an ATRP-like mechanism. Work within also reflects preliminary co-ordination to Iridium and Rhodium metal centers. Successfully synthesized Iridium complexes have been tested with respect to their oxidative properties. Positive results have been observed in their ability to perform oxidative addition with both HSnPh3 and MeI. Both small molecule species have been effectively added to an Ir(I) complex, formally changing its oxidation state to Ir(III).
