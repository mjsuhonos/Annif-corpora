    Can phenomenological architecture be simply described as: Phenomenological Architecture = Phenomenology + Architecture? In the simplest terms, phenomenology is the interpretive study of human experience. Any object, event, situation or experience that a person can see, hear, tough, smell, taste, feel, intuit, know, understand, or live through is a legitimate subject or phenomenological investigation. Architecture is not only the physical form of the building we inhabit, but a place, memory and time in which we see, hear, touch, smell, taste, feel, intuit, know, understand and live. Therefore, architecture is a natural subject for phenomenological investigation. As individuals, we immerse ourselves in the spaces we inhabit and form our own individual and unique experiences. By immersing ourselves in the spaces we inhabit, we interact with the form, textures and smells of the building which we are in. Can an inert thing such as a building help support the development of human beings' experiences; therefore help with his or her understanding of the world that they are physically in? The concept of phenomenological architecture seeks to provide a balanced and holistic physical manifestation of explaining, describing and representing an architectural intention that places emphasis on the human experience. The human experience includes paying particular emphasis on some of the essentials which help develops an experience. Essentials such as bodily senses, memories, materiality and perception are examined. This therefore creates a focus by using architecture as a catalyst in creating human experiences. In conclusion, phenomenology added with architecture does not fully explain phenomenological architecture, but it is how architecture works and helps encourage phenomena and experiences which creates phenomenological architecture.
