    This thesis investigates the influence of microsilica sand and local crushed sand, and different supplementary cementing materials on the mechanical properties of engineered cementitious composites (ECCs). ECC is a special type of high performance fiber reinforced cementitious composite with high ductility which exhibits strain-hardening and multiple-cracking behaviours in tension. The use of local aggregates in ECC production can lower its cost to mitigate the obstacles of wider commercial use.
    The experimental results showed that multiple-cracking behaviour was developed under fatigue loading for fly ash ECC (FA-ECC) mixtures, and the number of cracks was lower at both lower fatigue stress level and higher fatigue number of cycles. FA-ECC mixtures with silica sand exhibited higher deflection evolution under fatigue loading than FA-ECC mixtures with crushed sand. Based on the experimental results on link slab specimens, both FA-ECC mixtures with silica and crushed sands exhibited almost the same creep behaviour.
