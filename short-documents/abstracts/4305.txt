The Arctic has experienced greater climate warming in the last decade than anywhere else, potentially shifting its carbon status from a sink to a source. Increasing temperatures impact nival wetlands that rely on a strong hydrological input from melting perennial snowpacks. Soil moisture, soil temperature and active layer depth are key biophysical variables in predicting carbon flux trajectories in this environment. How these variables interact is crucial in delineating links between snowmelt and seasonal changes in wetland productivity. To date, there have been numerous studies that have examined these variables, but few have investigated the relationships between these biophysical variables and wetland thaw patterns at a high spatial and temporal scale. This study found a decrease in temporal variability and reduced interactions between variables as the wetland thawed as well as localized hot spots of increased values and an overall east to west trend across the site. This implies that Arctic wetland ecosystems are dynamic systems that reach a level of stability during peak growth. They also exhibit changeable spatial patterns that cannot be generalized.
