This thesis presents a flexible trailing edge mechanism capable of undergoing a change in camber for a wing section. The mechanism takes advantage of a rigid constraint between the ends of two flexible carbon fiber panels, which produces a deflection when there is a difference in length between the two panels. 

A prototype was designed and built and experimental data was collected for the deformation of the panels for different values of lengths and analyzed to find a function to describe the coefficients which form the polynomials describing the shape for each of the panels, based on the difference in length value. Deflection and deflection angle results were used to develop a controller which will calculate the required change in length based on a deflection or angle and a bottom panel length input.
