The field of international and development communications entered a new chapter with the emergence of digital information and communication technologies. Information and communication technologies (leTs) have long been a source of study for theorists and practitioners of international development, starting with study of the telegraph, fixed phone, and radio. However with the advent of digital technologies, the size of devices has
shrunken while simultaneously their power has expanded. This paper discusses one segment of the development communications paradigm, the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in relation to gender.
 One focus that demands greater scrutiny is gender. It's important to ask who is benefiting the most from using ICTs in development. For women in particular, using and accessing communications is more difficult than it is for men, a situation that authors of gender and technology studies have coined 'the Gender Digital Divide'.
