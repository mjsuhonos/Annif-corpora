This study examines the role of the Host Program in the social inclusion of newcomers into Canadian society through formation networks and ties with the mainstream community.  With the help of qualitative methods, this study seeks to investigate whether participation in the Host program facilitates building networks and ties among newcomers and host Canadians.  The findings suggest that the Host program facilitates the development of networks and ties with the host society, with the volunteers being the main structured opening into the mainstream group.  Informal and friendly interactions the host volunteers give newcomers a much needed sense of confidence and comfort, which in turn enables them to access and benefit from other existing services and make friends outside of their own communities.  This research concludes that the Host Program is indeed effective in expanding networks and building ties to mainstream society and potentially, in the social inclusion of newcomers into the receiving society.
