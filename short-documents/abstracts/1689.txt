    The purpose of this thesis is to develop a methodology for hydrological modelling the performance of Low Impact Development technologies using an Urban Hydrological Response Unit approach. The K-Means Cluster Analysis procedure was carried out to create clusters of lot parcels which represented the Urban Hydrological Response Units. Different sampling methods were used to select lots from each of the clusters to model before and after Low Impact Development implementation. The runoff response (m3) of an approximate final cluster centre was used to calculate the total runoff (m3) of each cluster. After adding the total runoff (m3) for a group of 15 clusters, the benchmark runoff value (m3) from modelling all lots was closely approached with and without Low Impact Development. A random sample of 7 % and 90 % of lots from each cluster for a group of three clusters closely approached the benchmark runoff value (m3) for both no Low Impact Development and Low Impact Development respectively.
