This study is aimed at developing a novel computational framework that seamlessly incorporates the feedback forcing model and adaptive mesh refinement mesh refinement (AMR) techniques in the immersed-boundary (IB) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM)  approach, so that challenging problems, including the interactions between flowing fluids and moving objects, can be numerically investigated. Owing to the feedback forcing based IB model, the advantages, such as simple mechanics  principle, explicit interpolations, and inherent satisfaction of no-slip boundary condition for solid surfaces are fully exhibited.  Additionally, the "bubble' function is employed in the local mesh refinement process, so that the solution of second order accuracy at newly generated nodes can be obtained only by the spatial interpolation but no temporal interpolation.  Focusing on both steady and unsteady flow around a single cylinder and bi-cylinders, a number of test cases performed in this study have demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of the present AMR IB-LBM approach.
