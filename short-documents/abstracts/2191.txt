    The streaming capacity for a channel is defined as the maximum streaming rate that can be achieved by every user in the channel. In the thesis, we investigated the streaming capacity problem in both tree-based and mesh-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) live streaming systems, respectively. In tree-based multi-channel P2P live streaming systems, we propose a crosschannel resource sharing approach to improve the streaming capacity. We use cross-channel helpers to establish the cross-channel overlay links, with which the unused upload bandwidths in a channel can be utilized to help the bandwidth-deficient peers in another channel, thus improving the streaming capacity. In meshed-based P2P live streaming systems, we propose a resource sharing approach to improve the streaming capacity. In mesh-based P2P streaming systems, each peer exchanges video chunks with a set of its neighbors. We formulate the streaming capacity problem into an optimal resource allocation problem. By solving the optimization problem, we can optimally allocate the link rates for each peer, thus improve the streaming capacity.
