    There has been widespread interest amongst scholars and activists in researching the concept of inclusion of young children with special needs in early childhood settings and public education. This qualitative research study provides insight into the lives of Canadian parents who have children with special needs in public education. Two interviews were conducted with three parents, all of whom have children with special needs in kindergarten and grade one.
    Key findings were interpreted from a social justice perspective which indicated that children with special needs are excluded in the public education system in a variety of ways. They do not have opportunities for inclusion with their typically developing peers. Parents become advocates as a result and struggle with accessing appropriate services for their children with special needs. Recommendations are made for implementing change within the education system and areas for future research are identified.
