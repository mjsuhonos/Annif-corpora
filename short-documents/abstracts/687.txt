    The history of the creation of racial categories is intrinsically linked to the existence of the taboo surrounding multiracial couples. This paper exposes the beginnings of how skin became a tool of oppression, race became a reality, and whiteness became normalized. Furthermore, science and academia are exposed in their biased search for an objective truth, that in Etienne Balibar's words, "(could) integrate the city into the cosmos" (2003), thereby justifying whiteness, segregation, and the status quo. Moreover, this paper then addresses the new formations and manifestations of racism that exist today and exposes their origins. The final section of this paper addresses Canadian multicultural policy and questions its hand in perpetuating and legitimating essentialized cultural and racial categories. The impact of multiculturalism on multiracial couples and multiracality is also addressed, and further anti-racist solutions are suggested to combat the persistence and prevelance of racism.
