Despite federal policy changes facilitating the recruitment and retention of international students in Canada, programming at Canadian universities is uneven and has created conditions for the population’s social exclusion. Canadian immigration policy has positioned international students as a desirable cohort of prospective immigrants, due to their age, economic potential, education, and official language skills. Canada’s 2014 International Education Strategy aims to double the number of international students, retaining them as economic migrants, and later permanent residents. However, temporary legal status and limited access to federally funded settlement services positions post- secondary institutions as the population’s primary settlement service provider, compounding the barriers to successful societal integration. As such, international graduates face barriers that mirror those of traditional immigrants. Critically exploring Canadian policy and post-secondary programming relating to international students, this paper applies the social inclusion perspective to recommend policy modifications and service approaches to ensure greater inclusion of international students.
