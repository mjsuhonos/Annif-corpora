With Internet of Things (IoT) being prevalently adopted in recent years, traditional machine learning and data mining methods can hardly be competent to deal with the complex big data problems if applied alone. However, hybridizing those who have complementary advantages could achieve optimized practical solutions. This work discusses how to solve multivariate regression problems and extract intrinsic knowledge by hybridizing Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Regression Trees. A dual-layer SOM map is developed in which the first layer accomplishes unsupervised learning and then regression tree layer performs supervised learning in the second layer to get predictions and 
extract knowledge. In this framework, SOM neurons serve as kernels with similar training samples mapped so that regression tree could achieve regression locally. In this way, the difficulties of applying and visualizing local regression on high dimensional data are overcome. Further, we provide an automated growing mechanism based on a few stop criteria without adding new parameters. A case study of solving Electrical Vehicle (EV) range anxiety problem is presented and it demonstrates that our proposed hybrid model is quantitatively precise and interpretive.
