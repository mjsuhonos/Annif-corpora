    It is essential to determine residual stress, as it can have a significant influence on the fatigue lives of engineering components, and as it can be induced unintentionally as well as intentionally. A classical method of measuring residual stress is to use hole drilling in combination with strain gauges, which themselves have inherent disadvantages. The Digital Speckle Correlation method (DSC) is a computerized method which determines displacement and strains and consequently calculates stress. This project demonstrates the viability of hole drilling in combination with DSC.
