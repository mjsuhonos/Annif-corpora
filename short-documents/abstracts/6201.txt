The recent application of recommender systems for educational resources and e-learning has facilitated online and accessible education on social networks. However, there are currently few studies about the methods for evaluation and performance measurement of these recommender systems in the complicated environment of educational and social networking platforms. The purpose of this research paper is to investigate the effectiveness of using sentiment analysis methods for educational resources based on user comments and compare it with the quantitative approach based on user rating to recommend best open learning resources (OER) available through online OER repositories. The quality of the OER will be justified by comparing the user rating and the users' reviews. The quality of users' reviews is based on calculating the term frequency for selected positive and negative terms, then determining the similarity among the comments. Comments with positive or negative words confirm the high and low ratings respectively.

Keywords: Open Education Resources, OER, Recommender Systems, Sentiment Analysis.
