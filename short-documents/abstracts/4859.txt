This paper presents insights into the lived realities of less than full immigration status women (LTFIS) living in Canada.  This exploratory project combines a review of existing literature and studies along with the research findings of 12 face-to-face interviews with key informants who work closely with the sample population.  This study found that the varying degrees of immigration statuses these women possess, and the rights and the entitlements that are affixed are further complicated by legal, policy and structural barriers stemming from the implementation of the immigration and refugee determination system.  This topic has been examined from a social exclusion framework and employs a race and gendered analysis in order to address the nuanced influences and outcomes of the extent to which LTFIS women understand their immigration status and able to navigate the immigration and refugee determination system.
