Abstract
The influence that environmental knowledge and belief have on people's behaviour is one of the important issues in the fields of engineering, environmental study, management and other related areas. However, currently, there is not enough study on household energy use at an occupant level or on evaluation of elements that can affect household's energy use such as environmental knowledge and pro-environmental attitudes in Canadian MURBs. As such, studying household's energy use and the interrelated effects on their energy consumption is believed to be a crucial step towards reducing energy consumption. Considering the significance of the issues stated above, the present study attempts to evaluate energy consumption and its possible correlation with environmental attitudes among the tenants of a Toronto high-rise multi-unit residential building. The research methodology is based on a quantitative survey method, and the focus of the study is on historical annual energy consumption from April 2011 to June 2013. The main tool for collecting data is a developed questionnaire, and Dunlap's NEP scale is used for measuring environmental attitudes. With regards to data analysis, the survey data and historical energy consumption data from April 2011 to June 2013 were analysed. The statistical sample size consisted of the 50 tenants who completed the NEP survey from July 29 to August 18, 2014. The detailed statistical results show that there is a negative correlation between environmentallyconscious attitude and energy consumption of the participants which is in agreement with the study's presented hypothesis. In essence, this means that having high environmentally-conscious attitudes towards the energy consumption has a positive effect on occupant's energy consumption level.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 Background on Energy Consumption in Canada's Residential Sector
Human values can have a big impact on their beliefs. This is defined by behaviours such as a person's approaches or reactions to how their behaviours react in life's impacts (Rokeach, 1979; Schwartz, 1996 and Ardahan, 2010). Values can be imagined as important life goals or standards that define a person's principles through their life's (Rokeach, 1973). In relation to environment and its problems, values may play an important role on for solving and/or for broadening the contradiction between individual and public interests (Axelrod, 1994; Karp, 1996; Keles, 2011). While conventional energy sources are limited, the demands for energy are increasing every day. In Canada, there have been many energy conservation efforts undertaken to tackle Canada's energy-related problems: energy security, fluctuations in fuel prices, and its threat to pollution. Residential sector in Canada accounts for more than 15% of Canada's energy consumption (NRCan, 2011) (Figure 1).

Multi-unit residential buildings (MURBs) represent the most significant component of the Toronto residential building inventory. Over half (55%) of the dwellings in the City of Toronto consist of apartment buildings. The majority of all Toronto dwellings (39%) are either mid-rise or high-rise apartment buildings of five or more storeys. Low-rise apartments of four or fewer storeys represent 16% of the dwellings in Toronto (Policy &
1

Research city of Toronto, 2007 and Binkley, 2012). MURBs, as the most common form of dwelling in Toronto, are also a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. On an annual basis, combined electricity and natural gas consumption of Toronto highrise MURBs are responsible for 68% of these emissions (Binkley, 2012). With increases in such emissions and energy consumption, environmental effects such as climate change and loss of biodiversity are at risk (Abrahamse et al., 2005). As a result, reducing household energy consumption would be beneficial for Canadians in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their threat to the environment. An overview of rental MURBs and their energy consumption shows that these buildings are energy inefficient due to their concrete frames, outdated building structure and features - e.g., heating and cooling equipment, appliances, etc. (City of Toronto, 2011 and Roque, 2013). In some MURBs the utility costs are included in their monthly rental payments which make improving energy efficiency a challenge. This creates an outcome of consumers not feeling responsible for the way energy is used in their units which is another dimension of high-rise MURB, since the actual consumers (tenants) do not pay their own utility bills. For example, keeping lights on when leaving their units or/and having an air conditioning system set to `on' while the windows are open in the summer or in the winter while nobody is at home. It is said that "buildings don't use energy: people do" (Janda, 2011). On the other hand, because of the inclusion of energy cost in the rental buildings, owners do not invest much into their rental properties in terms of energy efficiency. As a result, the majority of rental buildings are older and less energy efficient (Roque, 2013). There has been a significant amount of studies on Canadian household energy consumption, particularly in the matter of residential building design and materials. However, energy behaviour, attitude and usage, is a relatively new topic (Yohanis, 2012). The relations between values and attitudes which are interested about environmental issues and environmentally related behaviour are very complex (Ardahan, 2010). In order to achieve changes in people's behaviours, it is important to gain insight into their beliefs and values and how these might drive them to make decisions. Thus, opportunities for

2

significant reductions in energy consumption could be achieved by evaluating occupant's household energy use and attitude within high-rise MURBs (focus of this study). This study is part of a larger and an on-going research project which is called "Toronto Tower Renewal" with Ryerson University. The following section explains the specified project's concept and the discussion presented here will be limited to energy data for the residential sector with a focus on a MURB.

1.2

Toronto Tower Renewal Program

The City of Toronto's "Tower Renewal Program" is a program that was created with the aim of reducing energy consumption in MURBs. It is a municipal government initiative, where many parties - such as Canada Mortgage Housing Corporation (CMHC), Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (MAH), City of Toronto, government agencies (e.g., TCHC and CMHC), University institutions (e.g., University of Toronto and Ryerson University) and NGOs (e.g., Toronto's Atmospheric Fund (TAF)) currently peruse/check various components of Toronto's high-rise buildings. Components of the analysis accomplished in this study are used to report the tenant's household energy use in a Toronto MURB pilot site to interested stakeholders. In 2004, the concepts of revitalization and retrofitting Toronto's existing apartment buildings were presented by E.R.A. Architects (City of Toronto, 2011). The purpose of their research was to enhance energy efficiency and revitalize the community. In 2008, Toronto's City Council, and the then Mayor David Miller, also realized the significance of revitalization and making these buildings more energy efficient. The focus of the program is on MURBs that were built between 1945 and 1984 having eight stories or more. The City decided to make this project a municipal initiative and was called the Mayor's Tower Renewal Project (MTRP) in 2008. Similar programs were carried out in Amsterdam and Berlin and the Revitalization of Toronto's MURBs was inspired by them. Toronto's Tower Renewal Program would be formed by applying various retrofits, programs and activities to Toronto's MURBs. Retrofits included mechanical, storm water retention, green roofs and renewable energy.

Since Toronto possesses the second highest high-rise building density in North America, the proposed project offers great opportunities to create a cleaner, healthier environment and stronger communities, bring greater cultural awareness and activities as well as to improve local economic activity (City of Toronto, 2011).

1.3

Problem Statement

Once environmental problems surfaced in the 1970s, the main problems were about environmental pollution (air, land, visual, light, noise and water pollution), and resources (especially energy). Therefore, many studies focused on the condition for environmental quality or environmental concern (Ardahan, 2010). Nowadays, the environmental issues and challenges, particularly "energy consumption behaviour" has been the focus of attention for policy makers and scholars in the fields of sociology, environment study, management and so on (Maleki & Karimzadeh, 2011). One of the ways to prevent harming the environment and its destruction is the change in human behaviour towards the direction of the environmentalist dimensions (Quimbita & Pavel, 2005). The change in the people's behaviour towards the naturalist dimensions can be considered as one of the ways to avoid the damage to the environment and destruction of nature (Quimbita & Pavel, 2005). Based on the theory of Reasoned Action of Fishbin and Ajzen (1975), it is assumed that there is a systematic model between the people's approach towards a certain issue and the related behaviour towards that issue. On the other hand, scholars in the field of environmental study such as Borden and Schettino (1979), Schahn & Holzer (1990), Kaiser et al. (1999), Bayard & Jolly (2006) and Maleki & Karimzadeh (2011) believe that there is a relationship between environmental knowledge and significant environmental behaviour. In addition, Dull & Janky (2011) also found out the evidence on positive relationship between environmental attitudes and household energy consumption in advanced post-industrial societies. In most cases the previous scholars proved that there was a statistically significant relationship between the environmental attitude and energy consumption (environmental behaviour). However, currently, there is not enough study on household energy use at an occupant level or on evaluation of elements that can affect household's energy use such
4

as environmental knowledge and pro-environmental attitudes in Canadian MURBs (focus of this study). Thus, the issue to be considered here is how attitude affect energy use in a high-rise MURB in Toronto. Hence, this could be possible by finding out the relationship between environmental attitude and energy consumption behaviour.

1.4

Research Objectives and Intend of Research

The premise of the research is the attitude of the occupants focusing on energy consumption. The main aim of this study is to examine, correlate the impacts of occupants' environmentally-conscious attitudes on energy consumption in a Multi-Unit Residential Building (MURB) in Toronto. Considering the main aim of this study, the following objectives are formulated: 1) To examine the historical energy consumption1 of household over the past within a Toronto MURB. 2) To conduct a survey to examine a different dimension of household's environmentally-conscious attitudes within a Toronto MURB. 3) To investigate the correlation between household's environmentally-conscious attitudes and their historical energy consumption during the previous years and in the current year within a Toronto MURB. These objectives will be achieved by evaluating different occupants' attitude survey and comparing the information to their usage of energy. This will help determine their current attitudes towards energy consumption. 1.5

Research Question

The main research question is, Is there a significant relationship between the occupants' environmental attitude and their energy consumption within a Toronto MURB?

Historical data on all individual suite's energy use was collected by the property manager. This dataset begins in October 2010, is collected hourly.

The research further divided into several research questions as follows: 1) What is the nature of the historical household's energy consumption trend over the past years within a Toronto MURB? 2) How can we measure the household's environmentally-conscious attitudes within a Toronto MURB? These questions form the basis of the entire study. In the following section a literature review concerning the aforementioned problem statement is presented.

2.0 Literature Review
2.1 Energy consumption in Canadian Multi-Unit Residential Buildings (MURBs)
Nowadays the demand for energy is increasing while limited energy resources exist. From 2003 to 2004, the world energy consumption increased by 4.3% and the trend is not going to decrease (Hodgson, 2010). Consequently, energy cost is increasing over time. This increase can be an easy solution for energy efficiency but it is not the best solution by itself. Our society trends are beginning to reflect this by making poor people's lives harder than those who are wealthy. There are many ways to save energy; people just have to get learn about energy conservation (Hodgson, 2010). In 2001, around 31% of people in Canada lived in Multi-Unit Residential Buildings (MURBs), and that accounted for 24% of annual energy consumption within the residential sector (Liu, 2007). Moreover, the residential sector in Canada by itself consumed 1,439 PJ of energy in 2007 (Statistics Canada, 2010), in which space heating (63%), water heating (18%), major appliances (13%), lighting (4%), and space cooling (2%) were the main types of energy use in Canada (NRCan, 2012). An overview of rental MURBs and their energy consumption shows that majority of rental buildings tend to be older and less energy efficient than other high-rise MURBs (Counihan & Nemtzow, 1980 and Ghajarkhosravi, 2013). In some rental MURBs the utility costs are included in their monthly rental payments this creates a tendency for tenants (actual consumers) living in rental MURBs to become less careful about the way energy consumption is used in their units. On the other hand, owners also do not spend much effort into their rental properties in terms of energy efficiency. This in effect can explain why majority of rental buildings that are older are less energy efficient (Counihan & Nemtzow, 1980). Considering all of the above, improving energy efficiency in rental MURBs becomes a challenge.

2.2

Overview of Researches on Canadian MURBs

In Canada, almost one-third of Canadians live in a MURBs dwelling, this percentage is increasing year after year (Liu, 2007). There are many issues related to MURB tenants and household energy use. First, MURBs typically house tenants are from low socialeconomic status (United Way Toronto, 2011). This restricts households to invest in energy efficient appliances or improvements. Secondly, tenants who have less knowledge or uninformed about residential energy consumption have shown to consume more energy than those tenants who are more informed about energy consumption (Guerin et al., 2000). Such as access to information and knowledge about the tenant's household appliances and the amount of energy these appliances consume must be available in order to reduce energy consumption. Lastly, within the monthly rental costs utilities such as electricity and gas consumption can be included as part of the total monthly payments. As a result, less care is shown by the tenants in regards to intensity consumption levels of their household energy use. There are many factors which can affect the energy consumption of a household such as; by behaviour, age of the tenants, types of appliances, demographics of the tenants and etc. (Yohanis, 2012). These effects can lead to other elements resulting in the technical, economic, social and psycho-social origin (Cayla et al., 2011). Understanding and evaluating the tenant's present household energy use and environmentally conscious attitudes towards energy consumption is significant in order to develop energy reduction strategies such as tenant engagement and education. Also, determining all factors contributing to one's household energy consumption, however, this is complex. Statistics on energy consumption in Canada are collected by a number of government agencies including Statistics Canada and Natural Resources Canada's Office of Energy Efficiency. Information about residential energy use can be obtained from reports and data published by these agencies. However, before this data can be used as a point of reference, it is important to study how the data was collected so that the accuracy, completeness and relevance of the data are considered. The three main sources for residential energy use data are: The Survey of Household Energy Use (SHEU), the Energy Use Data Handbook (EUDH) and the Comprehensive
8

Energy Use Database (CEUD). Figure 2 provides a simplified diagram of the flow of information indicating the location, the sources and data for each. As shown in the diagram, information collected in the Report on Energy Supply and Demand in Canada (RESD), the SHEU as well as other surveys and data sources are combined as inputs into the Residential End-Use Model. The Residential End-Use Model processes the data and organizes it into categories as reported in the EUDH and the CEUD (Binkley, 2012). These three surveys are at a national scale and focus on energy intensity of home.

Figure 2: Flow of information for residential energy use data provided by government agencies (Binkley, 2012)

It should be noted that SHEU was a joint project between Statistics Canada and Natural Resources Canada (Natural Resources Canada, 2010). The project database collected information on household energy consumptions. SHEU uses building type for classification, including single detached, double/row houses, apartment and mobile homes. Prior to 2007, the data available for apartments only represented low-rise and mid-rise buildings up to five floors. In SHEU-2007, buildings with five floors and above were investigated regarding the abovementioned categories identifying both single detached houses and high-rise apartment only (Natural Resources Canada, 2010). In addition, numerous studies such as Aydinalp et al. (2003) and Marueljols and Young (2011) cite only SHEU versions due to the lack of data available on household energy use in Canada.

9

In addition, Natural Resources Canada's Office of Energy Efficiency - National Energy Use Database (NEUD) also addresses residential household energy use (Natural Resources Canada, 2011). NEUD compares Canada's energy consumption and carbon emissions, quantitatively, within the residential sector from 1990 to 2009 (Roque, 2013). Apartments surveyed in NEUD are located in various building types including residential and non-residential buildings; the buildings can be high-rise, mid-rise and low-rise. This database provides information on how different household types consume energy, while the factor of the building type is ignored. Household energy consumption involves many factors such as occupants' behaviours, ages, type of appliances, demographics, income, gender, and more. The findings in NEUD provide an overview of the tenants' type and their household efficiency. This information can be helpful to energy conservation strategies targeting on the occupants. However, for researches on a particular building type, such as high-rise MURBs, the NEUD is not appropriate source. The national surveys such as SHEU 2007 and NEUD lack other elements that contribute to occupant's household energy use (e.g., social aspects). Obviously, incorporating all factors of one's household energy consumption is not easy; but the national surveys do not consider social or psycho-social aspects. It should be noted that besides the two national and comprehensive surveys conducted in Canada, SHEU-2007 and NEUD, there has been a limited amount of research done on occupant's household energy use in Canadian MURBs. A study conducted by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) analyzed the energy intensity of 40 apartment buildings across Canada. Their study results showed that the average annual energy consumption of the 40 buildings was 279 equivalent kilowatt-hours per unit floor area (ekWh/m2). The average annual energy consumption of residential high-rise was 317 kWh/m2 from 1961 to 1980 and 212 kWh/m2 after 1981 which shows that buildings which were built after 1981 consumed 33% less energy than the older buildings (Enermodal Engineering Limited, 2001 and Roque, 2013).

10

Another study from CMHC investigated 10 high-rise MURBs across Canada. Two buildings located in each of the following provinces: Newfoundland, Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec and British Columbia. The study found energy intensity ranged from 152 to 309 kWh/m2, normalized to weather (Scanada Consultants Limited, 1997 and Huang, 2012). Eighty-eight of the Ontario Housing Corporation (OHC) high-rise apartments were assessed with two-thirds of the buildings had energy intensity ranging from 150 to 250 kWh/m2 with a mean of 232 kWh/m2 (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 2007). An interesting finding regarding this research is how the apartment buildings located in Toronto have greater energy usage than buildings in colder locations. The study explained that the greater portion of family-type buildings might use more energy than buildings with other occupancy types. Maruejols and Young (2010) found that whoever pays utility bills has a great impact on energy use. In their study based on SHEU 2003, MURBs in low-rise apartment buildings used 70% more electricity and 114% more overall energy when landlords paid for the utilities. MURBs in row houses and detached houses showed fewer differences but still used 40% more electricity and 37% more overall energy when landlords paid for the utilities. Levinson and Niemann (2004) had similar findings from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey and the American Housing Survey. They argued that although submetering can be one of the most cost-effective energy conservation measures, obstacles such as the installation fees, slow adoption of cost-effective residential energyconservation technologies, and rental contracts with zero-marginal-cost energy use elevated the energy consumption in rental housing when landlords paid for the utilities. Finch et al. (2010) developed a baseline of 39 mid-rise to high-rise MURBs in the Lower Mainland and Victoria BC. Energy intensity ranged from 144 to 299 kWh/m 2, with an average of 213 kWh/m2 and a median of 217 kWh/m2. The average heating degree-day (HDD) based on 18°C is 2,712 for the studied period. The climate in BC is milder compared with other provinces; thus requires less energy for space heating related demands. Another possible reason is that BC uses higher percentage electricity for heating (Natural Resources Canada, 2010). In 2007, electricity was 34% of the principal energy source for heating in BC, while it was 20% in Ontario. This can contribute to a
11

relatively low energy consumption of the buildings comparing with buildings located in other regions. In Huang's thesis (2012), she developed a weather normalized energy benchmark for 45 gas-heated high-rise MURBs in Toronto. The normalized annual consumption for these buildings was found to range from 242 to 453 kWh/m2. In Roque's thesis (2013), he developed a survey on household energy use and behaviour in a rental MURB in Toronto. The detailed analysis of his survey data resulted in the development of relationships between occupant's demographics and energy

consumption. By creating an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, results showed that the implementation of the survey may have reduced occupant's energy consumption in the high-rise MURB. (Roque, 2013). In Prada (2013) research, occupants self-assessed behaviour (occupants' surveys) was compared to actual metered consumption (actual energy use) in a recently retrofit MURB in Toronto. Since simulated building performance during the design stage often differs from actual building performance, a Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) which is a comprehensive building performance review had been designed. Results showed that the average estimated consumption was found to be 45% more than the average meters consumption. Also, based on the survey-based estimates 46% exceeded their expectation resulting to more respective metered readings, this translated to more than 50% of the original estimations. He concluded that results like these could lead to the miss-allocation of resources during a retrofit (over-sizing of supply lines, downplaying the use of the fan-coil units, etc.). Also, it can easily mislead energy saving strategies when it comes to appliance upgrades based on usage and overall efficiency. As a result, he recommended the use of mode-based cases to limit sources of discrepancy as well as more rigorous statistical analysis. Young (2011) also found that split incentives impact some aspects of occupant behaviour. He found that households that do not pay for their heating utilities were less sensitive to saving energy (e.g., turning off heating when no one is at home).

12

In summary, the research that has been conducted on Canadian MURBs mostly focuses on the energy intensity of the entire building quantitatively. Also, the large number of surveys on household energy use that have been conducted, much less is known about the human side of the energy tension, while residents can play an important role in energy conservation that supplements the engineering solutions.

2.3 The Relationship between Environmental Attitudes and Energy Consumption
According to the social psychology theories, the change in the behaviour will not happen by itself, unless environmental knowledge and pro-environmental attitude change (Dull & Janky, 2011). Also, Hines et al. (1986) found out that the prediction of environmental behaviour is not an easy process. This includes many different variables, apparently, that all act with correlation to each other (Maleki & Karimzadeh, 2011). Grob model in 1995 also showed that "the more people know about the environment, the more proenvironmental behaviour they will show" (Maleki & Karimzadeh, 2011). His reasons for asserting this, is the wide empirical backgrounds, based on environmental data surveys of Borden & Schettino (1979), Hines et al. (1987), Schahn & Holzer (1990) and etc. (Maleki & Karimzadeh, 2011). It is important to clarify how the environmental behaviour of people can be influenced by the environmental knowledge and belief. Therefore, consumers' attitudes are considered as important dete rminants of household energy usages (Dull & Janky, 2011). As the focus of this study, literatures reviewed are concerned with the relationship between household's environmentally-conscious attitudes and their energy consumption. Literatures clearly show the importance of the human role in residential energy consumption as their results verified quite persuasively that the energy consumption of a house cannot be completely understood without referring to the people in the house (Socolow, 1978 and Ardahan, 2010). In other words, individuals are the ones who make the decisions to use the machines that consume energy. Therefore, it is essential to explain how the environmental behaviours of people can be influenced by the environmental knowledge (Frick et al., 2004). This opens new doors in
13

the study of the impact of the environmental knowledge on effective environmental behaviour (Maleki & Karimzadeh, 2011). Only recently we have begun to learn about how people realize and respond to their "energy environment" and how their attitudes and motivations affect their energy consumption behaviour (Thomson & Research Ltd., 2013). Some earlier researches showed that environmental attitudes had a substantial effect on pro-environmental behaviour (Thompson & Barton, 1994; Stern et al., 1995; Poortinga et al., 2004). Those findings were according to the evidence gathered in advanced societies. It should be mentioned, however, the social context may also affect the equality among proenvironmental values, attitudes, and behaviour (Olli et al., 2001). Social context might assign not only to friends or family, but also to the whole social environment; one should not ignore the social value system of a given society (Ewert & Baker, 2001; Nordlund & Garvill, 2002). Regarding the environmental attitudes, Dunlap and Van Liere in the mid-1970s, impressed by Pirages and Ohrlich (1970) who took Dominant Social Paradigm (DSP) center as anti­environment in USA, concluded that because of environmentalism, challenges towards the environment and in the relationship of humans with the environment has been created (Maleki & Karimzadeh, 2011). There have been some research conducted by social psychologists to reduce residential energy consumption as well as examining the factors that influence consumption (Yohanis, 2012; Brandon & Lewis, 1999; Bonino et al., 2012). In the summer of 1976, Seligman et al. (1978) conducted two energy attitude surveys with two general purposes: 1) they wanted to see whether they could extract, from the many different attitudes that people have about energy and a few basic attitudinal dimensions that reflect people's conceptualizations of energy consumption; 2) they wanted to know whether these attitudinal dimensions relate to actual energy consumption. The respondents of their first summer (July, 1976) questionnaire was conducted on 56 couples living in townhouses in Twin Rivers, New Jersey. A second survey was
14

conducted on 69 couples on September 1976 in the same community to attempt to confirm the general results of the first survey. The 28 attitudinal questions were subjected in the survey and a statistical technique (factor analysis) was used to reduce the respondents' attitude scores to a relatively few attitudinal factors. According to their results (Seligmean, Darley, & Becker, 1978), 1) homeowners' attitudes towards energy can be conceptualized into a few basic factors, and 2) these attitudinal factors can predict actual energy consumption. In other words, their study showed a strong relationship and correlation between environment attitudes and energy consumption of the homeowners.

2.4

Overview of the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) Scale

Several ways of measuring people's environmental attitudes and basic ecological worldviews have been established since the 1970s. While only two measures are used frequently: the Ecological Attitude Scale developed by Maloney and Ward in 1973 and the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) Scale developed by Dunlap and van Liere in 1978 (Fransson & Gärling 1999). The NEP scale became one of the most used measures of environmental concern in the world and has been used in more than 100 studies around the world (Freudenburg, 2008 and Hawcroft & Milfont, 2010, and Thompson & Versus Research Ltd., 2013). To their beliefs, despite the dominance of anti-social ecological paradigm in western societies, in recent years, some thoughts have emerged that challenge the dominant western social paradigm in relation to Human Exceptionalism (Dunlap & Van Liere, 1978 and Maleki & Karimzadeh, 2011). The original NEP is defined by Dunlap & Van Liere in 1978 and had twelve statements that performed to demonstrate a single scale in the way in which people replied to them. This scale has been used in many countries over twenty years (Ardahan, 2010). However, it was criticized for several limitations, including a lack of internal reliability among individual responses, poor correlation between the scale and behaviour, and dated language used in the instrument's statements (Thompson & Versus Research Ltd., 2013). This study focuses on humans, the following passage explains the reason why the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) scale is selected to investigate household's
15

environmentally-conscious attitude in the present study. The literature showed that, the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) scale that Dunlap and von Liere developed was based on having the Dominant Social Paradigm at one end and on the other end, emerging environmental awareness (Thompson & Versus Research Ltd., 2013). The Dominant Social Paradigm (DSP) centres on humans seeing themselves as separated from nature more worthy than other organisms (Lundmark, 2007). With this moral predominance, humans are focused on their living conditions rather than anything or anyone else's, so that one of the key elements of the Dominant Social Paradigm is human related (Lundmark, 2007 and Thompson & Versus Research Ltd., 2013). In addition, the revised NEP developed by Dunlap et al., in 2000 which has fifteen statements explain ecological paradigm. Dunlap et al (2000) mentioned that in the various results, demographic factors also affected NEP scores. Also, Lovelock (2010) showed in his study when analyzing underlying causes for attitudes and behaviours, demographic factors such as gender, age, income, education and employment are regarded as important (Lovelock 2010, Diamantopolous et al., 2003 and Thompson & Versus Research Ltd., 2013). There are many researches that used NEP as their instrument of choice. Some studies that adopted the NEP scale as their method are selected in order to present the validity of the chosen method for the sake of the present study. Cordell et al. (2004) analyzed data from the US National Survey on Recreation and the Environment (NSRE). Bjerke et al. (2006) studied NEP in outdoor recreation interests and environmental attitudes, Ardahan (2010) studied NEP in outdoor sports and environmental attitudes with respect to some demographic variables. These studies show that there is a strong relationship and correlation between environmental attitudes and outdoor sports and activities. While the aforementioned studies implemented the NEP scale, they did not focus on the relationship between the environmentally-conscious attitudes and energy consumption of the household. Due to this fact the following studies will be presented as examples where the NEP scale is used while focusing on the topic of this study.

16

In 2013 , Thompson and his group was commissioned by Waikato Regional Council to survey 600 residents in the Waikato region, to measure current public attitudes towards the environment to gain an understanding of people's underlying beliefs that affect how they make decisions about the environment. This survey was a repeat of previous surveys conducted in 2000 and 2004 asking the same NEP scale as in previous years, along with nine new statements drawn from similar studies in environmental sociology. In the cluster analysis, the study divided the sample into three clusters, Pro-ecological, Mid-ecological and Anti-ecological. The results indicate that a person who achieves a pro-ecological score on the NEP scale is more likely to support actions that enhance the environment. A person who achieves an anti-ecological score is less likely to support actions that enhance the environment. These results show that while there is some variation in the data, there are some consistent demographic features that appear to influence respondents underlying ecological values. Dull and Janky (2011) assessed the relationship of environmental attitudes and household energy use. This was due to the fact that the energy prices are not the only motivation for energy conservation. Also, according to their belief, in many cases, savings may be achieved partly by technological investments; however, they can be largely achieved by changing the behavioural patterns of residents. In order to investigate their aim, they addressed electricity use and utilized multivariate regression technique on a sample of 503 residents of Óbuda (Budapest, Hungary) in February 2011. In order to better understand the structure of electricity use and its relationship with individuals' attitudes, they combined different types of control variables into the model systematically. For their method, a questionnaire addressed the major aspects of household energy use and included some attitude items and questions on the basic household characteristics and the respondent's socio -economic status. While in order to address environmental attitudes, they adopted the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale which has been proven to be a valid measure of environmental concerns. In their study, the results showed relationship between environmental attitudes and household energy consumption in advanced post-industrial societies.
17

Maleki and Karimzadeh (2011) conducted a study which examined individuals attitudes towards particular issue in relation to environmental, i.e., energy, with the energy consumption behaviour. Their research method was survey and the main tool for collecting data was questionnaire. Research data were collected in summer of 2010 and the main tool for collecting data was questionnaire. Dunlap's NEP scale was used for measuring environmental attitudes of 383 people who were citizens of Urmia (West Azerbaijan, Iran) and were selected using cluster sampling method. The results showed the participants owned positive environmental attitude. Results revealed that there was a statistically significant relationship between the environmental attitude and environmental behaviour (energy consumption) of the participants. However, their findings provided further evidence that suggest in addition to environmental knowledge such as some other factors must be taken into accounting of energy consumption behaviour. In their point of view, if the purpose of a research is to understand the influencing factors on environmental behaviour, other factors besides environmental knowledge must be considered.

2.5

Overview of Weather Normalization Methods

In order to collect enough data, excellent methods should be based on easily obtained information. Given the large amount of data involved, simple tools are chosen for a cost effective assessment process. This study will focus on single measure top-down methods of energy analysis. The residential energy use is influenced by multiple factors such as building physics, operation, tenants' characteristics, natural conditions and etc. Among these factors, climate has been identified as the main variable for energy use in cold climate region (Fels, 1986; ASHRAE 1985; Huang, 2012). In winter, when space heating is required, the simplest method to estimate energy consumption and assume the energy required to maintain comfort is a function of a single parameter which is the outdoor dry-bulb temperature (ASHRAE, 1985). The dry-bulb temperature is the temperature of air measured by a thermometer freely exposed to the air but shielded from radiation and moisture (Nall, 2004). Nall asserted that the dry-bulb temperature is the most important climate variables for human comfort and building
18

energy efficiency (Nall, 2004). The energy consumption normalized by weather variable is based on the assumption that when outdoor temperature drops below a certain level, a fixed amount of heating fuel is required for each additional degree of temperature drop (Chung, 2011). The term Heating Degree Days (HDD) is used as an indicator of building heating needs. Heating and cooling degree-days are calculated as the sum of the difference between daily the reference temperature and outdoor temperature (ASHRAE, 2009). The reference temperature for a building is the temperature at which neither heating nor cooling is required. It is determined by building characteristics, tenants' behaviour and appliances (Rachlin et al., 1986). Although reference temperature differs from building to building, this temperature is commonly accepted as either 50°F or 65°F (10 °C or 18.3°C) (ASHRAE, 2009). Environment Canada (2011) defines HDD as "the annual sum of degrees of the average daily temperature for all days below 18°C. Canada as a cold climate country has been divided into four climate zone 2 (A, B, C, and D) based on HDD (Figure 3). The zones are characterized by temperature ranging by; warmest climate (Zone A), mild climate (Zone B), cool climate (Zone C) and the coldest climate (Zone D). In these four climate zones Toronto is located in zone B (NRCan, 2011).

Figure 3: Different climate zones in Canada (NRCan, 2011)

According to NRCan (2012), a large portion of energy is used by space heating in cold climate provinces. Within the residential sector, 63% of the secondary energy is used for
2

Zone A (mild zone): <= 3500 HDDs, Zone B: > 3500 to <= 5500 HDDs, Zone C:> 5500 <= 8000 HDDs, Zone D (coldest zone): > 8000 HDDs

19

space heating in Canada (in 2009). Due to this reason, weather normalization has been chosen for the historic energy analysis in this study using the Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) (Fels, 1986) and the ASHRAE simple ratio weather normalization (SRWN) method (ASHRAE, 1985). Weather normalization methods are widely used in building energy consumption in cold climates. This method is based on the assumption that energy consumption for space heating follows a linear relation to the difference between the indoor and outdoor temperature, and the other end-use is constant over the year (Fels et al., 1986). Hirst & Goeltz indicated that outdoor temperature has the greatest short-term influence on fluctuations in household energy consumption while factors such as changes in fuel prices, household income, and the number of household members affect energy use only in the longer term (Hirst & Goeltz, 1986). Some widely used energy normalization methods tools are developed using the weather normalization concept. Following section will review two widely energy normalization methods, Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) (Fels, 1986) as well as the ASHRAE simple ratio weather normalization (SRWN) method (ASHRAE, 1985).

2.5.1 Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM)
PRISM was developed by the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies of Princeton University, with co-funding from participants in the Advanced PRISM Project (Fels, 1986). The most recent release was in January 1995, the PRISM® (Advanced Version 1.0), which was used in this research (Fels, 1986). PRISM is a regression-based model (statistical procedure), in which it uses outdoor weather temperature (from the nearest weather station) and monthly energy consumption (from utility bills). These inputs are then used to estimate the normalized annual energy consumption (NAC) as a base load for heat loss and heat gain rate of the researched building. In order to make the best use of available utility data, some improvements were made to the original PRISM over time. Features such as, heating-and-cooling model, robust model, an aggregate version, and an automated data correction/ outlier detection

20

(for reliability enhancement) were added (Fels et. al, 1995). PRISM estimates individual buildings' reference temperature according to optimized linear regression (Fels, 1986). The researched buildings outlined in the PRISM case studies, were from three different data sets in the New York City that included; 1) 71 multi-family buildings from the Building Energy Use Tracking System (BEUTS), 2) 30 oil heated multi-family buildings from Building Monitoring Data (BMD) project and 3) other listed from Energy Conservation Cases (ECC). The results of this data found that by using the PRISM method energy conservation can be successfully monitored and reliable NAC can be estimated both for oil and gas heated large multi-family buildings (Fels & Reynolds, 1992). In addition, the PRISM method has been used for analyzing energy consumption (gas related) for space and water heating in multifamily buildings (Decicco et al., 1986). The energy analysis of 16 buildings at Ryerson University (RU) was conducted using the PRISM method. These building represent 86% of RU's total area. The results of the PRISM analysis were then compared to the actual utility bills of the buildings. The comparison shows 2.7% and 6.4% discrepancy for hydro and steam consumption respectively, which makes PRISM results generally stable, and reliable (Fung et al., 2013). Another study done in New Jersey investigating the effectiveness of the PRISM models for selected dataset of electric-heated houses (with and without electric cooling system) shows that PRISM can provide a reliable NAC index even for buildings using electricity as their heating source. The estimated cooling reference temperature was found to be within the range of 21 to 29 degrees Celsius. The electric cooling demand is more related to occupant's behaviour than to outside temperature. The estimated NAC of the buildings having smaller demand for cooling tends to be more reliable (Stram & Fels, 1986). Since Canada is a cold climate country, which means heating seasons are longer (more energy is required for space heating) than cooling seasons PRISM is found to be suitable for this study. There are some advantages and disadvantages in using PRISM. The advantage of using PRISM is being able to estimate energy savings after retrofits and describe the energy
21

consumption of the studied building over time. Feeding twelve consecutive monthly data to PRISM will result in the most reliable outcome (NAC) (Rachlin, Fels, & Socolow, 1986). Limitations of using PRISM are not being able to predict the building future energy consumption and detailed breakdown of energy uses. According to Rachlin et al (1986), in order to achieve a reliable estimate for; base load, heating loads, reference temperature, summer data and winter data a full year (12 months) of building information is required to obtain a more accurate evaluation.

2.5.2 Simple Ratio Weather Normalization (SRWN) Method
The SRWN is a simple weather normalization method that has been used by industry for decades (Huang, 2012). Similar to PRISM, the simple ratio weather normalization (SRWN) methods use the traditional degree-day procedure for estimating heating energy requirements. In heating dominated climate, this method is used to estimate the total energy consumption. The demand for cooling is ignored in SRWN. SRWN simplifies the estimation process by assuming the reference temperature is 18.3°C. The estimated energy consumption is calculated using Equation 1 (ASHRAE, 1985).

 =
Where:

 



(1)

 : Normalized annual energy consumption  : Actual energy consumption  : Actual HDD of the annual historic energy use  : Long-term annual HDD
It should be noted that SRWN and PRISM only provide the overall energy consumption results; therefore, the breakdown results on end-use are not available for discussion.

Literature Gap

There has been a limited amount of research done on occupant's household energy use in Canadian MURBs. A majority of the research on Canadian MURBs focuses on the energy intensity of the entire building quantitatively. As mentioned before, the most comprehensive and cited surveys on household energy use in Canadian high-rise MURBs are SHEU-2007 and NEUD (Finch et al., 2010 & Roque, 2013). However these surveys have discrepancies in their classification of a MURB and lack of other elements that can affect a household's energy use. There is also a lack of information specifically related to high-rise MURBs at an occupant level. These surveys data's are based on general classifications of the residential sector. Factors such as; locations, year of construction, occupancy type, demographics and many more have a great influence on the energy consumption, and cannot be merged into one category. There is surprisingly lack of information relates high-rise MURBs' occupants' environmentally-conscious attitudes to their actual energy consumption. While literature has shown that there is a strong relation and correlation between environment attitudes and energy consumption of the occupants in residential buildings. It is the intention of this study to fill in this gap. This study would be useful to understand occupant's environmentally-conscious and the impact of social, demographic, and energy behaviour measures in a Canadian high-rise MURB setting. Hence, the current research is testing the environmentally-conscious attitudes relationship concerning energy consumption in the context of a low-income Canadian MURB.

2.7

Research Model & Hypotheses

According to previous studies (Maleki & Karimzadeh, 2011 and Dull & Jacky, 2011) and the presented theoretical perspectives, we can hypothesize: It seems that there is a relationship between environmental-conscious attitude and energy consumption behaviour.

23

Environmental attitude

Energy Consumption

Figure 4: Research model of the current study

As the current research model above shows (Figure 4), in the present study the independent variable consisted of the environmental attitude. While, the dependent variable (continuous variable) is the annual energy consumption of the household. Therefore, a survey and statistical analysis are conducted to achieve an understanding of the households' environmental attitudes which may affect the energy consumption. As a secondary data analysis, the relationship between the demographic characteristic of the occupants and their energy consumption is investigated. In 2012, a study was completed which analysed the occupants' energy use in the same MURB building using the method of surveying ("Household Energy Use" survey). To verify if the feedback of previous study had provided an influence on the household's attitude and energy consumption, additional testing is done in a new survey. Additional information regarding the procedure of these tests are evaluated in the Section 5.0. In the following section a methodology attaining the set of the aforementioned objectives of the present study is presented.

24

3.0 Methodology
3.1 Overview
As mentioned, this project was part of a larger and ongoing project which attempted to better understand the ways in which tenants engage with the spaces they inhabit and reduce their energy consumption patterns. Thus, in this regard, there are three main aims; 1. To reduce energy consumption by 10% at a MURB in downtown Toronto. This was through the implementation of a Tenant Engagement Program (TEP) that is intended to investigate long-term energy-conscious behaviour change amongst participating tenants. 2. To quantify the effects of combining direct feedback with social-norming data on personal energy reductions. 3. To examine and compare the impacts of environmentally-conscious attitudes on energy consumption which is the focus of this study. As indicated, the purpose of the present study is to gain an understanding of whether there is relationship between energy-conscious attitudes and energy consumption in a Multi-Unit Residential Building (MURB) in Toronto. A literature review was performed to establish information on the development of households' environmental attitudes studies in general and households' environmental attitudes towards energy consumption in particular. In order to obtain the set of objectives of the study, the empirical research method approach was applied. The methodology comprises the correlation between environmental attitudes and weather normalized energy consumption of the occupants in a Toronto MURB. The independent variable consists of environmental attitude. The dependent variable is the actual and weather normalized annual energy consumption of the household's occupants which might be regarded as a continuous variable. Therefore, an attitude survey (Subjective Measurement) and statistical analysis were conducted to achieve an understanding of the households' environmental attitudes which may affect on energy consumption. Moreover, historical data (Objective Measurement) on all 136 individ ual suites' energy use during the previous years was collected from the property manager and were
25

consequently analysed. It should be noted that historical energy use was from an earlier phase of the project which was monthly energy consumption before and after applying "Household Energy Use" survey in May 2012 by Miles Roque. Furthermore, a total of 48 out of 136 households completed the survey in previous phase which will be discussed further. The flow chart of the current study is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Overview of research methodology

This section explains the methodology implemented for the study. Evaluation of the occupant's environmental attitude is explained first. Following this, the details of each phase of the selected methodology are elaborated.
26

3.2

Subjective Measurement Method

The data from this study was obtained by conducting a survey. The purpose of this survey was to examine the households' energy-conscious attitudes in the units. In order to conduct a survey of household environmental attitudes in a Toronto MURB, the following tasks were undertaken: Collected information on the study site, Toronto MURB. Proposed a survey on household attitude towards energy use. Developed a plan regarding survey distribution and collection. Ryerson University's Research Ethics Approval. Collected survey results and analysis.

In the subsequent sections, the different parts of the subjective measurements will be described in detail. A. Units of study A case study was selected, this is a high rise-MURB located in Toronto, Canada which called "Green Phoenix" This building is owned and operated by a not-for-profit organization and it shares similar characteristics to majority of Toronto's MURBs. The building consists of, sub-metered apartment units that track energy consumption data (electrical) per apartment unit from October 1, 2010 until December 31, 2013. The submeter takes into account the entire plug loads and fan-coil unit consumption. It should be mention that fan-coil units within the specified building is for the delivery of heating/cooling throughout different seasons. The main focus of this case study focuses on the annual energy consumption of the units; it does not include heating and cooling loads from the central heating and cooling plant (Roque, 2013). Table 1 displays information about the study site at a building and apartment unit level.

B. Residents/Participants The participants of the study ranged from the ages of 18 years old and over. A maximum number of 50 tenants participated in this project. The tenants (participants) are typically low-income households who are not directly responsible for the payments or fees associated with their energy consumption, these fees are included in the tenant's monthly rental fee. C. Questionnaire To address environmental attitude, the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale which has been proved to be a valid measure of environmental concerns was adopted in July, 2014. The NEP survey consists of fifteen questionnaires documenting the tenants' opinions and perceptions concerning the energy use and the environment. These questionnaires were designed to be only a few short general questions about themselves. (Table 2 and Appendix A).

28

Table 2: The New Ecological Paradigm Scale under its revised version (Dunlap et al. 2000) 1. We are approaching the limit of the number of people the earth can support. 2. Humans have the right to modify the natural environment. 3. When humans interfere with nature it often produces disastrous consequences. 4. Human ingenuity will insure that we do NOT make the earth unlivable. 5. Humans are severely abusing the environment. 6. The earth has plenty of natural resources if we just learn how to develop them. 7. Plants and animals have as much right as humans to exist. 8. The balance of nature is strong enough to cope with the impacts of modern industrial nations. 9. Despite our special abilities humans are still subject to the laws of nature. 10. The so-called 'ecological crisis`facing humankind has been greatly exaggerated. 11. The earth is like a spaceship with very limited room and resources. 12. Humans were meant to rule over the rest of nature. 13. The balance of nature is very delicate and easily upset. 14. Humans will eventually learn enough about how nature works to be able to control it. 15. If things continue on their present course, we will soon experience a major ecological catastrophe.

The NEP scale became one of the most widely used measures of environmental concern in the world and has been used in more than 100 studies around the world (Freudenburg 2008; Hawcroft & Milfont, 2010; Thomson & Versus Research Ltd., 2013). Also, NEP has already been used in some other household oriented studies (e.g. do Valle, Reis, Menezes & Rebelo, 2004; Poortinga, Steg & Vlek, 2004; Maleki & Karimzadeh, 2011; Dull & Janky, 2011). As a protective measure, a consent form was provided with the survey. This was to ensure approval to acquire the personal information of the participants and the attendees who agree to fill out the survey. They were required to sign the consent form which was attached to the NEP questionnaire. The consent agreement, shown in Appendix B, was attached to the NEP questionnaire distributed to participants and the attendees. D. Method of Recruitment: Survey Distribution and Collection The survey that was conducted in the Toronto MURB building, evaluated the tenants that in total were comprised with 136 households (apartment units). Prior to survey distribution, notification flyers were posted in tenants' mailboxes on July 25th. Surveys were distributed by three methods:

29

1. Paper-based surveys were distributed on July 29th, 30th and 31st from 5.30pm8.30pm while the campaigning was held on in the main lobby of the building, by the Ryeson's research team. The attendees could fill the surveys out, either on the spot or they had the opportunity to bring them during the information sessions. 2. Tenants who had not completed NEP questionnaires had the opportunity to complete the survey during the information sessions which was held/organized on August 5th and 6th at 7.00pm. Assistance to complete the survey was available by ways of interacting with Ryerson's graduate students. It should be noted, the purpose of this information sessions was to raise the tenants' awareness of environmental issues by promoting energy literacy and conservation. The purpose of this was to provide awareness to the tenants about the project and to build a sense of community spirit amongst in the building. 3. Paper-based surveys were slipped under all 136-units' door on August 8th. A drop box was available in the main lobby and the drop box was removed on August 18th. E. Compensation and Incentives The compensation incentive ($20 cash) was offered to increase participation. This helped encourage the motivation of the sample size of those who complete the NEP survey.

3.3

Objective Measurements' Method

To develop a baseline, the historic energy consumption containing complete monthly energy consumption for the 136 units in the Toronto MURB was obtained from October 1, 2010 to December 31, 2013 (38 months). This energy consumption is the amount of electricity used by each apartment unit in a month (kWh/month/unit). Appendix C presents the energy consumption data from October 2010 to December 2013 and analysis of the energy intake.

Data Analysis Method

All survey responses were entered into Microsoft Excel's spreadsheets. After that, the analysis was then performed using IBM Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) which has many statistical tools and one of its functions includes the analysis of the survey data. Frequency tables were created for all survey results and to assess the relationship between occupant's attitudes and energy consumption. The NEP scale statements consist of the following scale and scores/values were given on a five-point scale for statistical analysis (Table 3).
Table 3: Five-point scale for statistical analysis

The scale consists of: Strongly agree Agree Neither agree nor disagree Disagree Strongly disagree

Points 5 4 3 2 1

This is proposed by the Thomson (2013) research which assessed the overall levels of environmentally positive attitudes of the Waikato region (New Zealand) residents during May 2008. The allocation of scores into the categories of Pro-Ecological, Mid-Ecological and Antiecological is based on a study by the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (1997) and Thomson & Versus Research Ltd. (2013). The result is compiled as the percentage of respondents in three categories based on the 15-75 scale. Pro-ecological ­ (Scores in the range of 59-75) ­ This is equivalent to a percentage score of 79 to 100 per cent and indicates that on average the respondent would have had to give environmentally positive "Agree" answers at least 13 times plus two "Strongly Agree" response to at least one statement. It would also be possible to give a combination of only two "Neither/Nor" answers and to answer the other four statements as "Strongly Agree".

32

Mid-ecological ­ (Scores in the range of 40-58) ­ This is equivalent to a percentage score of 54 to 78 per cent. At the lower end of this grouping, to be classed as mid ecological a respondent could give 13 "Neither/Nor" answers and two environmentallypositive "Agree" answer. At the upper end of this grouping, a respondent would have to give environmentally positive "Agree" answers to all fifteen statements. There are a range of combinations between these two ends. Anti-ecological ­ (Scores in the range of 15-39) ­ This is equivalent to a percentage score of 50 per cent or less. The most environmentally positive answers someone in this group could give would be fifteen "Neither/Nor" responses. At the lower end of this grouping someone would have to strongly disagree with all environmentally positive statements. An important factor of this study is to find the relationship between the attitude of the occupants and the annual consumption, (during the previous years within a Toronto MURB) the correlation testing technique is applied using SPSS which is explained in Section 5.0. The variables used in this study ensured that the descriptive analysis and hypothesis testing technique are due to the categorical variables. This will provide a deeper analysis of the evaluated statics.

4.0 Data Collection and Analysis
4.1 Overview
In order to examine the historical energy consumption of households over the past years within a Toronto MURB, information regarding the energy consumption data (tenants' energy consumption) was obtained. Once this information was reviewed, a method of analysis to aid in the organization of the data was created. The data was assessed and used in two different methods: i. Occupants' energy consumption were entered into a data pool by using Microsoft Excel and analysed. ii. Occupants' energy consumption were entered into PRISM software, and they were weather normalized. The content of this section is described in the information below: In the first step, in order to have a more accurate estimation of the occupants' energy use, the monthly energy consumption (kWh/month/unit) of the occupants (136 units) over the past years (October 2010 to December 2013) were obtained and analysed. In the next step, in order to have data sets with more accuracy, the historical energy consumption from October 1st 2010 to December 31st 2013 (38 months) explained in Section 3.3 was studied and were divided into three periods: 4) April 1st 2011 until March 30th 2012 5) July 1st 2012 until June 30th 2013 6) Annual energy consumption for the whole aforementioned periods Lastly, each set of the above mentioned historical energy use is divided into three categories: A) 48-Surveyed units6

B) 88-non-surveyed units C) All 136-units As discussed previously, the data from this study was obtained through the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale. This scale has been proved to be a valid measure of environmental concerns, by using the responses to the questionnaires. Following the historical energy consumption analysis, the NEP scale results are presented below.

4.2 Historical Energy Consumption of the "Household Energy Use" Survey 4.2.1 Actual Energy Use Assessment
The energy consumption was the amount of electricity used by each apartment unit in a month (kWh/month/unit) which is presented in detail in Appendix C. According to the analysis results, 19 months before and after7 applying the specified survey ("Household Energy Use" survey), energy consumption of the 48-surveyed units were 128,035 kWh (125 kWh/m2), and 114,234 kWh (111 kWh/m2), respectively. On the other hand, the energy consumption of the 88-non-surveyed occupants was 236,261kWh (126 kWh/m2) and 118 kWh (118 kWh/m2) for 19 months before and after the survey respectively. The distribution of the annual energy consumption shows that the energy behaviour had changed during this period (2010-2013) (Roques, 2012). In other words, after the implementation of the "Household Energy Use" survey in May 2012 by Miles Roque, it was concluded that the households' energy consumption had reduced (Figure 7 and 8).

Figure 8 shows the total energy consumption breakdown for the last three and half years. As shown below, a majority of the time, the 48-surveyed occupants consumed less energy after applying "Household Energy Use" survey.

Figure 8: Monthly energy consumption comparison between 48-surveyed and 88-non-surveyed occupants

36

As expected, the energy consumption turned out to be the highest in the winter and summer months due to heating and cooling requirements. Energy was consumed only in the form of electrical fan-coil units and plug loads (per suite).It should be noticed that the shoulder season are indicated by the months from mid-September to mid-November and from mid-March to mid-May (which has the minimum average monthly energy consumption) (Appendix C). In addition, as previously explained (Section 4.0), in order to have more accurate annual consumption data, the historical energy use was divided into two different groups that were analyzed consumption based on 12 months (April 1, 2011 until March 31, 2012 and July 1, 2012 until June 30, 2013). These groups contained one heating season and one cooling season (12 months). After the Actual Energy Use (AEU) analysis, results showed that the 48-surveyed units total annual energy consumption reduced by up to 9% (6,480 kWh/yr) after applying the "Household Energy Use" surveys. Moreover, Table 4 shows the Actual Energy Use (AEU) (kWh/unit/yr) comparison between three different periods. The total annual energy use (kWh) is divided by the total gross area of the building (2,906 m2) to obtain the Energy Use Intensity (EUI), while the total gross area of all surveyed units and non-surveyed units was considered as 1,026 m2 and 1,881 m2 respectively.
Table 4: Annual Actual Energy Use (AEU) analysis

Data analysis expresses the overall energy consumption of surveyed tenants (48 units) was reduced (9%) from 1,673 kWh/unit/yr (78 kWh/m2/yr) to 1,538 kWh/unit/yr (72 kWh/m2/yr) after applying the "Household Energy Use" survey. The analysis of the shown AEU provides the annual Energy Use Intensity (EUI) of the selected Toronto MURB building which is 76 kWh/m2/yr (1,620 kWh/unit/yr) within the past years (2011-2013).

37

In addition, the correlations between average energy consumption of the different categories (48-surveyed, 88-non-surveyed units and all 136-units), before and after applying "Household Energy Use" survey, and the outside weather temperature (Heating Degree Days) from the dataset are shown in Figures 9 and 10. The selected heating season months focus on the Heating Degree Days (HDD) above 500 based on the 18 °C balance point which is defined as a higher linear regression (R2) (Appendix D). As expected, when the HDD values increase, the energy consumption increases as well. Therefore, when the weather tends to demonstrate that the climate becomes colder, the HDD confirms that people will use more energy.

Energy Use Survey)

38

Figure 10: Average energy consumption vs. total HDD within 136 units' dataset (After "Household Energy Use Survey)

As the data analysis shows, the overall average energy consumption of surveyed tenants (48-units) was reduced from 139 kWh/month to 128 kWh/month after the application the "Household Energy Use" survey, while the average energy consumption of the nonsurveyed tenants (88 units) was reduced from 140 kWh/month to 132 kWh/month. In other words, as Figure 11 shows, after implementation of the survey ("Household Energy Use" survey), respondent's household energy consumption had reduced more compared to the non-respondent's household.

4.2.2 Normalized Energy Assessment
As mentioned previously, the historic monthly energy consumption for 136 units were inputted into the PRISM software. Three sets of historical energy consumption data (explained in Section 4.0) were normalized with the use of 32-year weather data in Toronto to create an average year simulation. The next step was to review the energy consumption of the 136 units from October 2010 to December 31, 2013 (38 months) using PRISM. Each set of historical energy data was divided into three categories, A) Surveyed units (48 units), B) Non-surveyed units (88 units) C) All units (136 units). PRISM uses regression models to provide the weather-adjusted Normalized Annual Consumption (NAC) index along with the best Reference Temperature for the studied building. Daily weather temperature (mean temperature) of Toronto for thirty two years, from January 1, 1981 to December 31, 2013, was retrieved from the Environment Canada website (National Climate Data and Information Archive). The mean annual HDD and CDD based on 18°C are 3938 and 431, respectively.

40

The average HDD and CDD of the 32-years, using 18°C as Reference Temperature, was calculated and shown to be as the typical Toronto long-term weather data. All the entered data had to be converted to Fahrenheit for the PRISM analysis. Moreover, and the acceptable range of input temperature is from -50°F (-45.6°C) to 120°F (48.9°C). The normalized annual energy consumption shows that the energy behaviour had changed during this period (2011-2013). In other words, after the implementation of the "Household Energy Use" survey by Miles Roque in May 2012, households' energy consumption had reduced. Based on PRISM analysis results (Appendix E), the reduction in the respondent's energy consumption was by 7% (from 76,826 kWh/yr to 72,026 kWh/yr). In other words, the difference between surveyed and non-surveyed households in terms of energy consumption was 3%. Table 5 illustrates the minimum, maximum and average NAC of the three different sets. The average NAC analysis shows that after carrying out the "Household Energy Use" survey, the energy consumption of the surveyed units (48 units) was decreased by 7% (from 1,601 kWh/yr to 1,501 kWh/yr). However, the energy consumption of the nonsurveyed units (88 units) was decreased by 4% (from 1,695 kWh/yr to 1,629 kWh/yr). The evaluated reduction between the average consumption of the 48-surveyed and 88-nonsurveyed was 3%. Overall, the PRISM modeling results of the historical energy use showed the average annual energy use for the selected Toronto MURB (all 136 units) was 1,609 kWh/yr within the 2011-2013 period.
Table 5: Minimum, maximum and average of normalized annual energy consumption Normalized Annual Consumption (NAC) 2011-2012 (kWh/yr) 2012-2013 (kWh/yr) 2011-2013 (kWh/yr) Min. Max. Ave. Min. Max.

Table 6 lists the average energy consumption per unit (kWh/unit/yr) in the comparison before and after Miles Roque's survey ("Household Energy Use" survey). The total normalized annual energy consumption (kWh) is divided by the total gross area of the
41

building (2,906 m2). In this respect, same as previous section (Section 4.2.1), the total gross area of all surveyed units and non-surveyed units was considered as 1,026 m2 and 1,881 m2 respectively.

By using PRISM, the annual EUI for the selected Toronto MURB building (136 units) was established as 78 kWh/m2 before and 74 kWh/m2 after applying the survey. Overall, according to the PRISM modeling results of the historical energy use, the EUI for the building (all 136 units) was 1,609 kWh/unit/yr (2011-2013). Furthermore, as presented in Table 7 (Appendix G), a statistical test (Pearson Correlation Coefficient) was run to verify the accuracy and reliability of the normalized data using PRISM compared to the actual data. Results indicated a strong, positive correlation between NAC and AEU in different periods (before and after "Household Energy Use" survey and the whole period), which was statistically significant (n = 50, p < .05) proving the reliability of the normalized model method.

Alternative Normalized Annual Energy Consumption Analysis using PRISM

As an alternative data analysis method, aggregate of all units' energy consumption were weather normalized (Appendix E). The results obtained through PRISM display that the 48-surveyed units' annual energy consumption (NAC) was reduced up to 9% (7,489 kWh/yr) after applying the "Household Energy Use" surveyed. However, the 88-nonsurveyed units' annual energy consumption decreased up to 6% (8,111 kWh/yr). As presented in Table 8, similar to the previous types of data analysis (Section 4.2.1. &
42

4.2.2), the results of the analysis showed that the 48-households' energy consumption decreased after applying the "Household Energy Use" survey in 2012.

4.2.2.2 Alternative Annual consumption Analysis using Simple Ratio Weather Normalization (SRWN) method To provide another comparison of the historical energy consumption during different periods, an alternative method was considered to normalize the data. In this regard, The ASHRAE Simple Ratio Weather Normalization (SRWN) method was applied to evaluate the annual energy consumption which presented as followed. SRWN method requires one-year energy consumption data and corresponding weather information. Since energy consumption and weather data are on an aggregated level, the readings in the year can be either monthly or multi-monthly. The flexibility of data input is an advantage of SRWN. For some buildings, there is only one reading for the full summer season. Using the total readings does not affect the calculation of NAC. The SRWN method cannot detect the outlier in the data; the data screening process is essential. The actual annual HDD, is the sum of daily HDD from the starting date to the ending date of the annual historic energy consumption. In the present study, the historic energy consumption, discussed in Section 3.3, was comprised of complete monthly energy consumption from October 1, 2010 to December 31, 2013 (38 months). However, in order to have more accurate data set which includes one heating and one cooling season (whole year), the actual HDD of the annual historical energy use which is used for the data analysis is demonstrated as follows (Table 9 and Appendix D).
Table 9: Heating Degree Days (HDD) of April 2011-March 2012 and July 2012-June 2013 Before Survey (2011-2012) Heating Degree Days (°C-day) 3131 After Survey (2012-2013) 3499

43

The annual energy consumption normalized using the SRWN method were within the range of 1,995 kWh/unit/yr and 1,641 kWh/unit/yr for 48-surveyed households before and after applying the "Household Energy Use" survey, respectively (Table 10).
Table 10: Normalized annual consumption analysis using SRWN

1,818 1,843 1,843

22 19 20

The EUI for the selected Toronto MURB building during 2011-2013 was obtained as 86 kWh/m2 (1,843 kWh/unit) using the SRWN method. Since, the EUI for the building (all 136 units) was 75 kWh/m2 (1,609 kWh/unit) calculated by PRISM for the whole period (2011-2013), the SRWN model tends to overestimate the results, as compared with PRISM. This is because by using the SRWN method only HDD is considered for the purpose of calculating the energy consumption. However, the PRISM method considers both HDD and CDD. SRWN is a simpler method compared to PRISM in terms of weather normalization technique. SRWN is ideal for users who have limited expertise and/or time to obtain relatively accurate energy benchmarking. However, the error of the results may increase when raw data contains inappropriate estimated readings. To examine the nature of the historical household's energy consumption' trend over the past years within a Toronto MURB, different methods was performed. In the three different sets of energy consumption trends, the annual energy consumption was elaborated and analysed by using PRISM and the ASHRAE Simple Ratio Weather Normalization (SRWN) method. In accordance with all the specified data analysis, it can be concluded that the difference between surveyed and non-surveyed households was 3%. This finding was compatible with the results obtained by Roque (2012) in the earlier phase where the "Household Energy Use" survey was applied. Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach, he concluded that his survey may have influenced the reduction in the respondent's energy
44

consumption. In the current phase of research, the historical data is tested, before and after applying the "Household Energy Use" survey, using statistical method (SPSS approach). This method will help to gain a more valid and detailed approach. The results obtained through the statistical analysis are elaborated in Section 5.

4.3

Historical Energy Consumption of the "NEP" Survey

Since the focus of this study is on the results from the NEP survey respondents, with the approval from Research Ethics and the Toronto MURB occupants, NEP survey was conducted for the duration of 20 days (July 29th to August 18th, 2014). A total of 50 households responded to the questionnaires (NEP Survey), at the current phase of research. The survey results (data) are presented in Section 4.4. To achieve the main objectives of this study, the historical energy use of the 50households who completed the NEP Survey is divided into three different time periods (identical to the previous section) and used in the data analysis which is presented in Table 11 and Appendix F.
Table 11: Analysis of the 50-households energy consumption during different periods

1,562 1,619

1,572 1,683

In addition to the abovementioned data analysis, with the purpose of having more accurate and deeper data analysis, energy consumption of one year prior to the NEP survey implementation (July 1st, 2013 to July 31st, 2014) was examined (Appendix F). According to the analysis results, total energy consumption of the 50-surveyed units were 94,310 kWh/yr (1,886 kWh/unit/yr) during 12 months before applying the NEP survey (July 2013-July 2014). Furthermore, the correlations between average energy consumption of the 50 households who completed the survey before applying "NEP" survey (July 2013 to July 2014), and the outside weather temperature (Heating Degree Days) from the dataset are shown in
45

Figures 12. The selected heating season months focus on the Heating Degree Days (HDD) were based on the 18 °C balance point. As expected, when the HDD values increase, the energy consumption increases as well. Therefore, when the weather tends to demonstrate that the climate becomes colder, the HDD confirms that people will use more energy.

Figure 12: Average energy consumption comparison vs. HDD (50-surveyed units)

In order to gain further insight, with respect to the outdoor temperature, energy consumption of the 50 units from July 2013 to July 31, 2014 (12 months) was reviewed and normalized using PRISM. According to the Environment Canada website (National Climate Data and Information Archive), the mean annual HDD and CDD based on 18°C are 3979 and 402, respectively. Overall, the PRISM modeling results of the historical energy use showed the average annual energy use (Normalized Annual Consumption-NAC) for the selected Toronto MURB (all 50 units) was 100,708 kWh/yr (2,014 kWh/unit/yr) within the 2013-2014 periods.

NEP Survey Results

As presented previously, this project was part of a larger and ongoing project which attempted to better understand the ways in which tenants engaged with the spaces they inhabit and reduce their energy consumption patterns within. There were two surveys that were performed, the earlier phase was achieved in 2012 to evaluate the energy behaviour of the occupants (using "Household Energy Use Survey) in the MURB. The current phase applied in 2014, was to determine the environmentallyconscious attitude of the occupants towards energy consumption (using the NEP Survey). Some of the participants who completed the NEP survey were the same as those who participated in the previous survey. Figure 13 illustrates the quantity of the households who responded to the previous and present survey.

Figure 13: Selected Toronto MURB households' status

As shown in figure 13, a total of 50 households completed the NEP survey in the current phase of research (2014). Among all of the respondents, 24-housholds completed both surveys ("Household Energy Use" and NEP Survey) which were implemented in 2012

47

and 2014. In other words, 26-households (52%) solely participated in the current phase of research and completed the NEP survey. After gathering the survey data, the information was then categorised into various demographics. The demographics were categorized into various groups such as gender, age, nationality and general information (Appendix A). The following demographical and general information distribution was obtained from the 50 survey responses (Table 12).

5.0 Data Analysis and Discussion Using SPSS
5.1 Overview
The main purpose of the present study is to gain an understanding of whether there is a relationship between energy-conscious attitudes and energy consumption in the MultiUnit Residential Building (MURB) in Toronto. To explore the relationship between environmental attitudes and energy consumption, a series of statistical tests was carried out. The independent variable consists of environmental attitude. The dependent variable is the actual and weather normalized annual energy consumption of the household using PRISM which is as a continuous variable. Therefore, an attitude survey (Subjective Measurement) and statistical analysis were conducted to achieve an understanding of the households' environmental attitudes which may affect energy consumption. It is crucial to note that the results of this section were discovered using SPSS version 22. It is important to emphasize that the SPSS model represents the 50 respondents living in the Toronto MURB. In order to attain the set of objectives of the study, following hypotheses and descriptive statistics are considered:

Historical Energy Consumption Analysis

As discussed previously, to determine whether there is a significant difference between households' average energy consumption before and after applying "Household Energy Use" survey in 2012, a statistical method was applied. So according to the previous study (Roque, 2012) and the presented data analysis (Section 4.0), we can hypothesize the following:

1) It seems there is a significant difference between the average energy consumption
of the 48-surveyed households and the 88-non-surveyed households. 2) It seems there is a significant difference between households' average energy consumption before and after applying "Household Energy Use" survey in 2012 (previous phase of the research). To test the aforementioned hypotheses, "Independent-samples t-test" was conducted. A t-test helps in comparing two groups and determining whether they have different average values and whether a difference between two groups' averages is unlikely to have occurred because of random chance in sample selection. A difference is more likely to be meaningful and "real" if, i. ii. iii. The difference between the averages (Mean Difference-M) is large, The sample size is large, and Responses are consistently close to the average values and not widely spread out (the Standard Deviation-SD is low). In the present study, to achieve the objectives, wherever the t-test was applied the Sig. value from the Levene's Test for equality of variances and normality was checked (Appendix G). It is a test that determines if the two conditions have about the same or different amounts of variability between scores. As a result of this study, the results of the Levine's test satisfied the assumption for normality and equality of the variance. Also, some descriptive statistics about each condition of different sets was found.

Testing Hypothesis # 1

Comparison between average energy consumption of the 48-surveyed households and the 88-non-surveyed households: Data analysis in Section 4.0 showed that 48 tenants who completed the "Household Energy Use" survey in 2012 consumed less energy than those who did not complete the specified survey. In other words, there is a difference between the energy consumption of the 48-surveyed and the 88-non-surveyed households. That difference is up to 3%. The aim of this test is to find out whether tenants who completed the "Household Energy Use" survey in 2012 consumed less energy than those who did not complete the specified survey. As a result, the energy consumption (Normalized Annual Consumption-NAC, Actual Energy Use-AEU) of the 48-surveyed households was compared with 88-nonsurveyed households during different periods (before and after the survey and throughout the whole period) in order to find the difference statistically. Results of each of the performed t-test, as well as the means and standard deviations for each of the groups, are shown in Table 13 (Appendix G). The t-test results show that there is no significant difference in the scores of the two groups (48 surveyed participants and 88 non-surveyed participants) for each of the time periods, based on the significance value (p) which was greater than 0.05.

The average energy consumption difference of the 48-surveyed, 88-non-surveyed and all 136-housholds in different periods is shown in the Table 18. Since the results shown in Table 14, demonstrated that the mean difference does not vary significantly, comparing two different groups, shown in Table 14 (Appendix G), average energy consumption difference of those groups were 7% (94 kWh/yr (6%) mean difference 2011-2012, 128 kWh/yr (8%) mean difference 2012-2013) and 3% (5 kWh/yr (1%) mean difference 20112012, 42 kWh/yr (3%) mean difference 2012-2013) within the normalized and actual energy consumption, respectively. This can be due to the lack of enough sample size through the previous phase of research (N= 48-surveyed with 88-non-surveyed occupants).

Data analysis showed that the households' energy consumption decreased after applying "Household Energy Use" survey (Section 4.0). The next section will address whether a difference between average energy consumption of 48-surveyed before and after applying "Household Energy Use" survey is statistically significant. Testing Hypothesis # 2

Comparison between average energy consumption of the households before and after applying "Household Energy Use" survey in 2012: Data analysis in Section 4.0 showed that the energy consumption (energy behaviour) of the tenants of the selected Toronto MURB was changed during this period (2011-2013). In other words, after the implementation of the "Household Energy Use" survey in May 2012 by Miles Roque, households' energy consumption had reduced (up to 9% through the 48-surveyed households' actual annual consumption and 7% within the normalized annual consumption).
52

To test the current hypothesis (hypothesis # 2), the difference in households' energy consumption (48-surveyed and 88-non-surveyed) before and after applying "Household Energy Use" survey was compared/analysed statistically. Results of each t-test performed, as well as the means and standard deviations for each of the groups, are shown in Table 15 (Appendix G). The t-tests results indicate that there is no significant difference between the two conditions (before and after applying the "Household Energy Use" survey), based on the significance value (p) which was greater than 0.05.

However, as discussed in Section 4.0, a difference could be found between the two conditions' means. Descriptive statistics shown in Table 16 (Appendix G) presented that the mean energy consumption of the 48-surveyed units, 88-non-surveyed units and all 136-units decreased after implementation of the "Household Energy Use" survey. Again, in agreement with the results of the previous test, this difference is non-significant and is likely due to the sample size (N= 48-surveyed and 88-non-surveyed households).

To sum up, the results from those two above-mentioned tests implies that, unlike the research hypotheses a significant difference between the average energy consumption of the different groups (48-surveyed and the 88-non-surveyed households) before and after applying "Household Energy Use" survey in the previous phase of study (2012) have not been seen in this study. Thus, this research hypotheses are not confirmed.

5.3

NEP Survey Findings

As mentioned earlier, with respect to the main objective, the present study aimed to test the following hypothesis (main hypothesis). "There is a relationship between environmentally-conscious attitudes of the 50 households who completed the NEP survey, and their energy consumption for each of the periods (before, after and throughout the whole period)." At this stage, the relationship between the environmentally-conscious attitudes of 50housholds who completed the NEP survey and their energy consumption for each of the three periods (before, after applying "Household Energy Use" survey and throughout whole period-2011-2013) were statistically examined. In order to test the relationship between the 15-item NEP scale scores and energy consumption (normalized and actual energy consumption) of 50-housholds for different periods, "Pearson Correlation test" was conducted. In statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) is a measure of the

linear correlation between two variables In other words; it is a measure of the strength of the association between two variables. The value of r is always between +1 and ­1. If Pearson's r value is near 1, it means there is a strong relationship between variables. If Pearson's r value is near to 0, it means there is a weak relationship between the two
54

variables. Different correlation coefficient value between variables are defined as follows (Taylor & Rdcs, 1990). a) Pearson correlation coefficient (r) < 0.3: low or weak correlation b) 0.3  Pearson correlation coefficient (r)  0.6: moderate correlation c) Pearson correlation coefficient (r) > 0.6: strong or high correlation Testing hypothesis

Correlation between environmentally-conscious attitudes of the households and their energy consumption: The test results showed the correlation coefficient (r) between these two variables is significant at p<0.05. As shown in Table 17, there is a moderate negative correlation between the NEP survey scores and historical energy consumption of the 50 households who responded to the NEP Survey in 2014. As this is a negative correlation, this indicates that as occupants' attitude scores increase, their energy consumption decreases for each of the three periods. This means that as the people attitudes get more positive towards environment, their responsible energy consumption behaviour also increases. This result was confirmed using both the NAC and AEU as energy consumption variables.

Before survey (2011-2012) After survey (2012-2013) whole period (2011-2013) Before survey (2011-2012) After survey (2012-2013) whole period (2011-2013)

-0.32* 0.025*

*Correlation is significant at 0.05 level (2-tailed)

Of the results shown in Table 17 (Appendix G), it is evident that the correlation between normalized energy consumption (NAC 2012-2013) and household's attitude, after applying "Household Energy Use" survey, had the higher correlation (moderate negative correlation at r= -.358, p=0.011) compared with the actual energy consumption in different periods. This can be likely due to the fact that normalized energy consumption (NAC) is a more reliable measure of energy consumption. It should be noted that weather normalization methods is based on the assumption that energy consumption for space
55

heating follows a linear relation to the difference of the indoor and outdoor temperature, namely HDD and the other end-use is constant over the year (Fels, 1986). In the next phase of statistical tests, another test (Pearson Correlation test) was run to check the relationship between the reductions in annual consumption between the 20112012 and 2012-2013 time periods and the 50-households' environmentally-conscious attitudes who completed the NEP Survey. Results of the test indicated that there is a correlation between occupants' environmentally-conscious attitudes and the difference in their energy consumption before and after applying the "Household Energy Use" survey, when the NAC was used as the energy consumption variable (r = 0.297; p = 0.036) (Table 18 and Appendix G). As such, it is shown that when the score of environmentally-conscious attitude of households goes up, their energy consumption difference increases (their score of their energy consumption decreases).
Table 18: Correlation between the households' energy consumption and 15-item NEP scale results NEP Survey Results vs. Occupants' Energy Consumption Difference (kWh) Normalized Annual Consumption (NAC) Actual Energy Use (AEU) 0.036* 0.318 0.297 0.144 50 50

* Correlation is significant at the .05 level (2-tailed).

However, no significant correlations could be found between occupants' attitudes and energy consumption when AEU was used as the energy consumption variable. This can be likely due to the fact that normalized energy consumption (NAC) is a more reliable measure of energy consumption because it is normalized based on the long-term annual HDD as explained previously. In present study, it could be asserted that there is a negative correlation between household's environmentally-conscious attitude level and energy consumption. So, in this regard, it can be concluded that as a result of the correlation test, our hypothesis is correct. This means that having high environmentallyconscious attitudes towards the energy consumption have positive effects on occupants' energy consumption level.

56

This finding is compatible to the results obtained by Maleki and Karimzade (2011) and thus in order to explain the relationship between attitude and behaviour, and their work could be of great help in this work. They conducted a study to find a possible correlation between energy consumption and environmental attitudes among the 383 citizens of Urmie, West Azarbaijan (cold climate). In their results, the correlation coefficient (R) between these two variables was 0.177 which is significant at P= 0.001. Their findings were also well-matched to the results obtained by Dunlap et al (1978), Salehi (2010).

5.3.1 Descriptive Statistics of 15-item NEP scale
Descriptive Statistics # 1

Household's 15-item NEP scale level: The results for the 15-item NEP scale discussed previously (Section 3-4), were compiled as the percentage of respondents in three categories based on the 15-75 scale which are as followed. 1) Pro-ecological ­ Scores in the range of 59-75 (79%-100%) 2) Mid-ecological ­ Scores in the range of 40-58 (54%-78%) 3) Anti-ecological ­ Scores in the range of 15-39 (50% or less) The scores are categorised into Pro-ecological, Mid-ecological and Anti-ecological categories which is based on a study by Social Scientist Community, Economy And Enlivenment Programme Resource Information Group (2013). Caronbach's alpha () has been used to assess the reliability and consistency of the statements that form the scale. A Cronbach's (alpha) is a coefficient of internal consistency. It is commonly used as an estimate of the reliability of a psychometric test for a sample of examinees. A Cronbanch's  of 0.7 is regarded as the lowest score for a scale to be considered reliable. The 15-item NEP scale was tested for reliability using Cronbach's , and with all 15 of the statements that form the scale, Cronbache's  was 0.669 (Thomson, 2013). In this part, the level of the 50-occupants' environmentally-conscious attitudes towards energy consumption were determined, by applying "Frequency test" using the SPSS software (Figure 14 Appendix G).
57

Figure 14: 15-item NEP scale Categories

From the total of 50 households being examined in this study, in terms of environmental culture of sample, results indicated that the majority of the households (76%, N=38) who completed NEP survey held Mid-ecological views; 18% of the households (N=9) achieves an Pro-ecological score which is more likely to support actions that enhance the environment. While only 6% of the participants (N=3) achieved an Anti-ecological score on the NEP which is less likely to support actions that enhance the environment. This result could reflect household's' attitude to environmental issues and as discussed in Section 2-3, the change in the behaviour will not happen by itself, unless environmental knowledge and pro-environmental attitude change. Also, it is important to clarify how the environmental behaviour of people can be influenced by the environmental knowledge and belief. Therefore, consumers' attitudes are considered as important determina nts of household energy usages (Dull & Janky, 2011). Descriptive Statistics # 2

15-item NEP scale vs. historical energy consumption: The impact of the households' environmentally-conscious attitude on their energy consumption was examined. The difference between category one's (occupants with Pro 58

ecological attitudes) levels of energy consumption, and the other two groups (category 2; occupants with Mid-ecological attitudes and category 3; occupants with Anti-ecological attitudes) were examined using a "One-way ANOVA" test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test is used to determine whether there are any significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups. For this test, the dependent variable was the occupants' energy consumption at different periods, and the independent variable was the three different categories of 15-item NEP scale. As explained previously (Section 3.4), 15-item NEP scale were divided into three categories according to the percentage score (Category 1: Pro-Ecological = 79%-100%; Category 2: Mid-Ecological = 54%-78%; 3: Anti-Ecological = 50% or less). Results showed that there was a statistically significant difference at the p<.05 level between different three categories in terms of energy consumption (NAC) (Table 19 and Appendix G).

In our sample, the average energy consumption in different NEP scale categories is varied. Distribution of energy consumption (energy behaviour) shows that those who had particularly higher environmental-conscious attitude, consumed less energy. For instance, as shown below (Table 20 and Appendix G), according to the normalized data (NAC), the average energy consumption of the occupants with Pro-ecological attitudes (1,294 kWh/yr) was less than the occupants with Mid-ecological (1,686 kWh/yr) and Antiecological attitudes (3,169 kWh/yr).

Moreover, in order to analyze data more in detail, another test was applied which called Post hoc test in the analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Post hoc tests are designed for situations in which the researcher has already obtained a significant omnibus F-test with a factor that consists of three or more means and additional exploration of the differences among means is needed to provide specific information on which means are significantly different from each other. Results showed that there was a statistically significant difference at the p<.05 level between different three categories in terms of energy consumption (NAC) and those households who allocated in Pro-ecological category consume less energy compared to the other groups (Appendix G). The present study findings are consistent with results obtained by Dull and Janky (2011). Their study aimed to assess the relationship of environmental attitudes and household's energy use. In order to investigate their aim, they addressed average monthly electricity use and utilized multivariate regression technique on a sample of 503 residents of Óbuda (Budapest, Hungary) in February 2011. Their findings showed relationship between environmental attitudes and households energy consumption. According to their belief, in many cases, savings may be achieved partly by technological investments; however, they can be largely achieved by changing the behavioural patterns of residents. Their data also showed that the effects of housing type and demography are much larger compared to the effects of the attitudes. Descriptive Statistics # 3

15-item New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale vs. occupants' demographic: Some studies stated that various factors such as age, gender and education affected NEP scores (Dunlap et al., 2000). When analyzing underlying causes for attitudes and behaviours, demographic factors such as gender, age, income, education and
60

employment are regarded as important (Lovelock, 2010; Diamantopolous et al., 2003). These have also been found to be important influences on environmental perception and behaviour. In the study conducted by Diamantopolous et al (2003), relationships between age and environmental consciousness were examined by surveying 33 studies in that area. Upon completion of their study, only 2 of the 33 presented a significant relationship where younger people are shown to exhibit higher levels of knowledge. Moreover, when testing their hypothesis which stated that there is no relationship between age environmental knowledge, they found significant and consistent results showing a negative relationship between age and attitudes (Diamantopolous et al., 2003). Furthermore, regarding the effect of education on environmental attitudes, a large number of studies discovered that obtaining higher educational qualifications results in scoring higher on all environmental themes (Diamantopolous et al., 2003). Moreover, in this regard, a difference between males and females has also been exhibited. Although males were found to display a higher level of environmental knowledge than females, a higher level of environmentally conscious attitudes and behaviour were generally shown by females rather than males (Diamantopolous et al., 2003). Also, they tested their findings by conducting a survey on British British customers. In that test, they discovered that females possess stronger environmental attitudes than males (Diamantopolous et al., 2003). At this stage, in order to determine whether there are any significant differences between the 15-item NEP scale collected from 50-households and their demographics, "One-way ANOVA" test was applied. It should be noted that, in the present study, only information about the occupant's age, gender and nationality were collected and thus the demographical analysis were limited to these factors. From the total of 50 households being examined in this study, 72% of the occupants were male and 28% female. In terms of nationality, the majority of the participants were from an African ethic background (52%). Considering the age range of participants, 44% were

61

between 46-60 years old, 26% over 60 years old, 18% between 31-45 years old and 12% between 18-20 years old. When the results for the 15-item NEP scale were analyzed demographically (age, gender and nationality), non-significant differences were observed by regions of origin, age and gender of the participants. These results were based on the significant value (p) which is greater than 0.05 (Gender, F= 2.314, p=0.135; Age, F= 1.143, p=0.342; Country of origin, F=1.47, p=0.209) (Table 21).

As the present study's focus was only on the household's environmental consciousness and energy consumption, the investigation of the effects of demographics on household energy consumption, was outside the scope of this research. This is mainly as a result, due to the lack of a large enough sample size (N=50) in order to collect data/information regarding the occupant's demographics. Such an examination could be a topic of a potential future research that analyzes the relationship of each of these demographic categories to energy consumption. Descriptive Statistics # 4

The aim of this section is to determine whether there is significant difference between the attitudes of 24-households who completed both surveys and the 26-housholds who completed just one of them (Section 4-4). To achieve this aim, the Independent-samples t-test was conducted in SPSS. Statistical analyses showed that there was no significant difference (t (48) =.302; p= 0.764) between these two groups of households (Table 22 and Appendix G). In other words, "Household Energy Use" survey does not affect the participation in the current survey (NEP Survey) and there is no bias from the previous experience.

Among all of the respondents, 24housholds completed both surveys ("Household Energy Use" and NEP Survey) which were implemented in 2012 and 2014. 26-housholds solely participated in the current phase of research and completed the NEP survey. To discover whether there is significant difference between energy consumption of the 24-households who completed both surveys (Household Energy Use and NEP Survey) and the 26-housholds who only completed the NEP Survey, the "Independent-samples ttest" was conducted in SPSS. For the current test, variables which were tested, were energy consumption variables (NAC and AEU) of the 24-housholds completed both surveys ("Household Energy Use" and NEP Survey) and the 26-housholds solely participated in the current phase of research. To achieve this objective, both variables were analyzed in different periods. As presented below (Table 23 and Appendix G), the results show that there were no difference between energy consumption of those occupants who participated in both surveys and those who did not. This result is the same as the previous test result where
63

it was found out that "Household Energy Use" survey does not affect the participation in the current survey (environmentally-conscious attitude - NEP Survey) and there is no bias from the previous experience. To sum up, it can be concluded that there were not much difference between the attitudes and energy consumption of 24-households who completed both surveys and the 26-housholds who completed only one of them. This can be likely due to the gap between the two phases of the study. That is, while the participants' energy behaviour was examined in May 2012, the participants' environmental consciousness was checked in July 2014.

5.3.2 Alternative Statistical Analyses of NEP Survey
As discussed in Section 4.3, energy consumption of one year prior to the implementation of the NEP survey were investigated to support the results of this study and to gain further insight. Thus, after examining the energy consumption of the 50 households who completed the NEP survey from July 1st 2013 to July 31st, 2014 (Section 4.3), the relationship between the environmentally-conscious attitudes of the 50-housholds and their historical energy consumption (Actual Energy Use and Normalized Annual Consumption) were statistically examined for the specified period. In order to test the relationship between the 15-item NEP scale scores and their energy consumption, the "Pearson Correlation test" was conducted in the same way as specified in Section 5.3.
64

The test results showed the correlation coefficient (r) between these two variables is significant at p<0.05 and p<0.01 for the normalized and actual energy consumption respectively. As shown in Table 24 (Appendix H), there is a moderate negative correlation between the NEP survey scores and the energy consumption of the 50 households. The correlation coefficient (R) between these two variables was -0.391, with a significance at P= 0.005, and -0.343, with a significance at P= 0.015 for actual energy use and normalized annual consumption respectively.

*Correlation is significant at 0.05 level (2-tailed) ** Correlation is significant at 0.01 level (2-tailed)

Furthermore, following the same pattern as the statistical analysis done in Descriptive Statistic # 2 (Section 5.3.1), the difference between occupants with Pro-ecological attitudes' levels of energy consumption, the occupants with Mid -ecological attitudes and Anti-ecological attitudes were examined. For the sake of the current set of analysis, the impact of the households' environmentally-conscious attitude on their energy consumption was obtained by applying a "One-way ANOVA" test. Results presented in Table 25 (Appendix H) showed that there was a statistically significant difference at the p<.05 level between the different three categories in terms of energy consumption and that those households who were allocated in the Pro-ecological category consumed less energy compared to other groups. It should be noted that this result was confirmed using both the Normalized Annual Consumption (NAC) and Actual Energy Use (AEU) as energy consumption variables.

Also, similar to the previous section, in order to analyze the data more in detail, "Post hoc" test in the analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted. The results presented in Table 26 showed that there was a statistically significant difference at the p<.05 level between different the three categories in terms of energy consumption (NAC) and therefore those households who were allocated in the Pro-ecological category consume less energy compared to the other groups (Appendix H).

As pointed out previously, these results are well-matched to the results obtained by Dunlap et al. (1978), Salehi (2010) and Dull & Janky (2011). Moreover, for the current set of analysis, "One-Way ANOVA" test is also performed in order to analyse the 15-item NEP aforementioned scale' results demographically (age, gender and nationality). Same as the previous set of statistical analysis presented in Section 5.3.1, after the results for the 15-item NEP scale were analyzed demographically, non-significant differences were observed by regions of origin, age and gender of the participants. These results were based on the significant value (p) which is greater than 0.05 (Gender, F= 2.314, p=0.135; Age, F= 1.143, p=0.342; Country of origin, F=1.47, p=0.209) (Appendix H). Lastly, to achieve the objective of this section, an "independent-samples t-test" was conducted using SPSS to determine whether there is a significant difference between the attitudes and energy consumption of 24-households who completed both surveys and the 26-housholds who completed just one of them (Section 4-4). As presented in Appendix H, the results show that there were no difference between energy consumption and attitudes of those occupants who participated in both surveys and those who did not.
66

This result is the same as the previous section's result (Section 5.3.1) where it was found out that "Household Energy Use" survey does not affect the participation in the curre nt survey (NEP Survey) and there is no bias from the previous experience. To sum up, the presented findings are consistent with results obtained in the previous section (Section 5.3.1) which potentially further support the analyzed data results of this study.

6.0 Conclusion
Nowadays, the environmental issues and challenges, particularly "energy consumption" behaviour has been the focus of attention for scholars in the fields of engineering, environment study, management and related areas. The change in people's behaviour towards energy consumption/naturalist dimensions can be considered as one of the ways to avoid the damage to the environment and destruction of nature. To attain behavioural changes, at first, it requires a change in individual's attitude towards that issue. For this reason, achieving an understanding of human attitudes (e.g. environmental attitudes) and exploring individual cognition is essential (Maleki & Karimzadeh, 2011). It should be mentioned that the issue of energy is a priority and of high importance in this research because the statistical sample for this study are residents of the cold region of Canada where due to the climate and ecological conditions there is inevitably a high level of energy consumption. Therefore, knowing about household's energy consumption pattern and factors affecting it, have important and central roles in the energy use area. This research attempted to gain an understanding of whether there is a relationship between occupant's household energy-conscious attitudes and energy consumption of 50 households in a high-rise MURB in Toronto. The main tool for measuring the occupants' household environmental consciousness was Dunlape's NEP scale which has been proved to be a valid measure of environmental concerns. Paper-based surveys also incorporated some general information of demographics (gender, age and country of origin).

67

Occupants' energy consumption was collected by ways of sub-meters which captured the electrical draw of each unit from April, 2011 to June, 2013. At first, in order to have a more accurate estimation, households' historical energy consumption (kWh/month/unit) were analyzed during different periods of time (before, after applying "Household Energy Use" survey and throughout the whole period) by PRISM. Results indicated that total energy consumption in the studied MURB is linearly related to the outdoor temperature. The normalized annual energy consumption of the 136-households was within the range of 78-79 kWh/m2 during 2011-2012 (before applying "Household Energy Use" survey), and 74-73 kWh/m2 during 2012-2013 (after applying "Household Energy Use" survey). All households' energy consumption were also normalized using SRWN method which showed good consistence with PRISM results. Besides, data analysis in Section 4.0 showed that the energy consumption of the selected Toronto MURB's tenants was changed during this period (2011-2013). This finding was in accordance with the results obtained by Rouqe (2012) in the earlier phase. Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach, he concluded that his survey ( "Household Energy Use" survey) may have influenced the reduction in the respondent's energy consumption. However, results from the first two tests indicated that unlike the results obtained throughout the data analysis (Section 4.0) have not been seen in this study. This can be likely due to the lack of sample size (N=48) and two different approaches which were applied for data analysis throughout these two studies. The main purpose of the modeling was to examine the existence of a significant relationship between environmental attitude and energy consumption (environmental behaviour) of the MURB occupants. A total of 50 surveys were collected from the 136 households in the Toronto MURB. In order to analyse the data, the statistical approach (using SPSS) was applied using survey data and historical energy consumption. In general, from the total of 50 households examined in this study, a majority of the participants in this survey consisted of the following categories: male gender (72%), age range between 46-60 (44%), African ethnic background (52%), building occupancy more

68

than 7 years (62%), single occupant household (82%) and tenants who did not participate in the earlier phase ("Household Energy Use" survey- in 2012), (52%). With respect to the main objective of the study, the analysis showed there was a statistically significant negative correlation between the 50-respondents' households environmental attitudes and their energy consumption. Also, it should be noted that this result was confirmed using both the Normalized Annual Consumption (NAC) and Actual Energy Use (AEU) as energy consumption variables. This finding is compatible to the results obtained by Maleki and Karimzade (2011) and thus in order to explain the relationship between attitude and behaviour. In their results, the correlation coefficient (R) between these two variables was 0.177 which is significant at P= 0.001. Their findings were also well-matched to the results obtained by Dunlap et al (1978), Salehi (2010). Moreover, in order to analyze the data more in detail, another test was applied. Results showed that there was a statistically significant difference at the p<.05 level between the different three categories in terms of energy consumption and that those households who were allocated in the Pro-ecological category consume less energy compared to the other groups. The present study findings are consistent with results obtained by Dull and Janky (2011) which showed relationship between environmental attitudes and households' energy consumption. This indicates that as occupants' attitude scores increased, their energy consumption decreased for each of the three periods. In turn, this result suggests that as the people's attitudes get more positive towards the environment, their responsible energy consumption behaviour also increases.

7.0 Recommendation for future work
The following are recommendations for future research on occupant's household energy use in another Toronto MURBs. 1- When analyzing the underlying causes for attitudes and behaviours, demographic factors such as gender, age, income, education and employment are regarded as important (Lovelock, 2010; Diamantopolous et al., 2003). The occupants' information
69

collected throughout the present study, only obtained the occupant's general factors such as age, gender and country of origin. To improve and strengthen the validity of the results, the result for 15-item NEP scale needs to analyse demographically and in more detail. As a result, a survey of household's environmental attitude incorporates other elements such as occupants' education, income and employment is needed. 2- To evaluate any potential bias between the variables and to improve the validity of the results, the average energy consumption of the 50-surveyed households and the 86non-surveyed households could also be analysed. Correspondingly, to find out whether there is any significant difference between their average energy consumption, a statistical method should be applied. 3- To determine the most significant factor that influences energy consumption of a MURB in Canada, results of the previous phase of the study (Household Energy Use Survey) should be compared to the current phase of study (NEP Survey). 4- Some other factors must be taken into account when analyzing energy consumption behaviour. Therefore, if the purpose of a research is understand of the affecting factors on environmental behaviour, other factors besides environmental attitude (e.g. environmental knowledge/ literacy) must also be considered. 5- Because of limited access to personal information, the survey collected information by ways of mail-in and interviews. Other survey methodologies such as telephone interviews and on-line could increase the survey response rate (sample size) to have a greater representation of the pilot site. 6- Since this research focused on a single MURB located in Toronto, the results found in this study are not generalizable for other Toronto MURBs. The NEP survey can be applied to another high-rise MURB resulting in the development of a larger datasets on occupant's household environmental attitudes view.

Appendix D: Historical Energy consumption Detail (24 months)
In order to have more accurate annual data, historical energy use was divided into two different groups of 12 months (April 1, 2011 until March 31, 2012 and July 1, 2012 until June 30, 2013) which contain of one heating and one cooling season each set. Also, average energy consumption vs. Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD) of the surveyed and non-surveyed units is analysed below. Scattered-plot of annual energy consumption demonstrates as Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD) increase, energy consumption increase as well. Therefore, the conclusion can be made that, as weather tends to get colder, people use more energy. The correlation between average energy Consumption and HDD/CDD from the data set are shown in followed.
